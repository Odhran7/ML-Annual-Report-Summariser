the following is an overview of the trends affecting the market in which we operate by each of our customer verticals we believe the networking needs for each of our customers will eventually result in cloudbased network architectures for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency 

cloud 

our cloud vertical includes companies that are heavily reliant on the cloud for their business model’s success customers in the cloud vertical can include cloud service providers such as the largest public cloud providers which we refer to as hyperscalers and tier2 cloud providers as well as enterprises that provide saas infrastructureasaservice or platformasaservice 

cloud providers continue to grow as more organizations take advantage of public infrastructure to run their business as their businesses grow we expect they will continue to invest in their networks which dictates the quality and experience of the products and the services they deliver to their endcustomers further as cloud providers adopt new technologies including the 400gigabit ethernet or 400gbe and in anticipation of the future adoption of 800gigabit ethernet or 800gbe and beyond we believe this should present further opportunities for us across our portfolio as our cloud customers value highperformance highly compact power efficient infrastructures which we support and continue to develop 

in addition saas continues to be an important factor for cloud providers as their customers such as enterprises prefer to procure and consume product and service offerings via saas models as a result we believe that saas providers will invest in high performance infrastructure because the quality of experience has proven just as important competitively as software features and functions lastly as a result of regulations and the need for lower latency and highperformance networking cloud providers have been transitioning to regional network buildouts or distributed cloud environments to address the increasing demand for services data privacy data protection and consumer rights 

as cloud customers are pushing the envelope in networking our focus on collaboration combined with networking innovation around automation has made us a strategic partner with these customers helping them develop highperformance and lower total cost of ownership networking solutions to support their business

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals business development teams systems engineers marketing teams channel teams and an operational infrastructure team is based on both vertical markets and geographic regions 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships as described below 

we sell to a number of cloud and service provider customers directly otherwise we sell to all of our key customer verticals primarily through distributors and resellers 

direct sales structure 

the terms and conditions of direct sales arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders along with acknowledgment of our standard order terms or by direct master purchase agreements the direct master purchase agreements 

table of contents 

with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

channel sales structure 

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales we utilize various channel partners including but not limited to the following 

• a global network of strategic distributor relationships as well as regionspecific or countryspecific distributors who in turn sell to local vars who sell to enduser customers our distribution channel partners resell routing switching and security products software and services which are purchased by all of our key customer verticals these distributors tend to focus on particular regions or countries for example we have substantial distribution relationships with ingram micro in the americas and hitachi in japan our agreements with these distributors are generally nonexclusive limited by region and provide product and service discounts and other ordinary terms of sale these agreements do not require our distributors to purchase specified quantities of our products or services further most of our distributors sell our competitors products and services and some sell their own competing products and services

manufacturing and operations 

as of december 31 2021 we employed 343 people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who manage our supply chain including relationships with our contract manufacturers original design manufacturers component suppliers warehousing and logistics service providers 

our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in china malaysia mexico and taiwan as of december 31 2021 we utilized celestica incorporated flextronics international ltd accton technology corporation foxconn technology group and alpha networks inc for the majority of our manufacturing activity our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production including activities such as material procurement surface mount assembly final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to ensure that our products meet internal and external quality standards we believe that these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

• we can quickly ramp up and deliver products to customers with turnkey manufacturing 

• we operate with a minimum amount of dedicated space and employees for manufacturing operations and 

• we can reduce our costs by reducing what would normally be fixed overhead expenses 

our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components used in our products to address supplychain challenges including increases in component and logistics costs related to the covid19 pandemic and global 

table of contents 

component shortages we take specific procurement action including the exercise of strategic purchases of raw material in addition to our partners normal procurement once the components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast are procured our manufacturing partners assemble and test the products according to agreedupon specifications products are then shipped to our distributors resellers or endcustomers however we also purchase and hold inventory consisting primarily of components for the production of finished goods for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the contract manufacturers or original design manufacturers location customers take title to the products upon delivery at a specified destination if the product or components remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period we may incur carrying charges or charges for excess or obsolete materials 

our contracts with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer as applicable may accept purchase orders from us these contracts do not represent longterm commitments 

some of our custom components such as asics and communication integrated circuits are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs to ensure the security and integrity of juniper products during manufacture assembly and distribution we have implemented a supply chain risk management framework as part of our overall brand integrity management system this framework encompasses all aspects of the supply chain as well as enhanced elements specific to security issues applicable to juniper products and our customers 

by working collaboratively with our suppliers and as members of coalitions such as the responsible business alliance responsible minerals initiative and the cdp supply chain program we endeavor to promote socially and environmentally responsible business practices beyond our company and throughout our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted a business partner code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers our business partner code of conduct expresses support for and is aligned with the ten principles of the united nations global compact and the responsible business alliance code of conduct the responsible business alliance a coalition of electronics retail auto and toy companies provides guidelines and resources to drive performance and compliance with critical corporate social responsibility policies its goals are to promote ethical business practices to ensure that working conditions in the electronic industry supply chain are safe that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible by using standard audit and assessment protocols and tools we measure and monitor manufacturing partners’ and select direct material suppliers’ compliance to the codes of conduct and applicable environmental health and safety labor and ethics legal requirements including but not limited to onsite audits risk assessments cdp climate change and water requests and conflict minerals surveys our corporate social responsibility report which details our supply chain efforts and business partner code of conduct are available on our website 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under master sales agreements either with our distributors resellers or endcustomers at any given time we have a backlog of orders for products that have not shipped because certain orders are cancellable or delivery schedules may be changed we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results the covid19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented industrywide supply constraints and the pandemic continues to play a role with ongoing delays to the global logistics environment as a result we experienced a shortage of component parts and logistics timing issues in 2021 which resulted in significantly higher levels of our product backlog we expect these challenging supply chain conditions to persist in the near term 

as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 our total product backlog was approximately 18330 million and 4196 million respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to our distributors resellers or endcustomers generally within six months for 2020 and within twelve months for 2021 extended primarily for the ongoing impact of supply chain constraints backlog excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts

seasonality 

we as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns historically we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter of the fiscal year this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

competition 

we compete in the network infrastructure markets these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to solutions that combine high performance networking with cloud technologies in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc or cisco has historically been the dominant player however our principal competitors also include arista networks inc dell technologies hewlett packard enterprise co or hpe huawei technologies co ltd or huawei and nokia corporation or nokia 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco nokia hpe and huawei among others have broader portfolios which enable them to bundle their networking products with other networking and information technology products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition marketing budgets and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

in addition there are a number of other competitors in the security network infrastructure space including cisco huawei nokia a10 networks inc palo alto networks inc check point software technologies ltd fortinet inc zscaler inc netskope inc and forcepoint llc among others who tend to be focused specifically on security solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line 

we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco nokia and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that aim to build products with greater capabilities to compete with our products further there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue which may increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios 

in addition to established competitors a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior and cost effective in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have and also from emerging companies that are developing new technologies although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies there can be no assurance that new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

material government regulations 

our business activities are worldwide and subject us to various federal state local and foreign laws in the countries in which we operate and our products and services are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products to date costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations have not been material to our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position although there is no assurance that existing or future governmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations products or services will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations nonetheless as discussed below we believe that environmental and global trade regulations could potentially have a material impact on our business 

environment 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain our operations and many of our products are

subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals and substances of concern in products regulations adopted by the european union or eu and china 

juniper’s greatest impact on the environment is through our products and services our product sustainability approach prioritizes 1 designing products with the environment in mind 2 providing solutions for responsible endoflife management and 3 empowering our customers to save energy and reduce their networkrelated carbon emissions to help execute on this juniper has an environmental program based on our new product introduction process that supports a circular economy model for environmental sustainability and focuses on energy efficiency materials innovation and recyclability we consider opportunities to minimize resource impacts and improve efficiencies over a product’s life cycle from the materials we use and a product’s energy consumption to packaging and endoflife activities such as reuse refurbishment and recycling for example the juniper certified preowned program offers a broad range of refurbished highperformance network solutions from juniper’s current line and endofproduction hardware portfolios with available juniperbacked warranty and support services 

we also voluntarily participate in the annual cdp climate change and water security disclosures and encourage our manufacturing partners and select direct material suppliers to do the same additionally we are a signatory supporter of the united nations global compact and a member of the responsible business alliance or rba and have adopted and promote the adoption by our suppliers of the rba code of conduct as discussed above in the section entitled manufacturing and operations  we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to execute on monitor and drive environmental improvements in our global operations and within our supply chain 

global trade 

as a global company the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties us export controls and sanctions laws customs regulations and local trade rules around the world the scope nature and severity of such controls varies widely across different countries and may change frequently over time such laws rules and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals or by requiring us to comply with domestic preference programs laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology or source code unique technical standards localization mandates and duplicative incountry testing and inspection requirements in particular the us and other governments have imposed restrictions on the import and export of among other things certain telecommunications products and components particularly those that contain or use encryption technology most of our products are telecommunications products and contain or use encryption technology and consequently are subject to restrictions the consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally we continue to support open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated crossborder supply chains that are expected to continue to contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements 

for additional information concerning regulatory compliance and a discussion of the risks associated with governmental regulations that may materially impact us see the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology

licenses 

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products and from time to time we need to renegotiate these licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

we operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict some of these risks are highlighted in the following discussion and in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investors should carefully consider all relevant risks before investing in our securities the occurrence of any of these risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

risks related to our business strategy and industry 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and financial performance remains uncertain the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to negatively affect our operations including as a result of external factors beyond our control such as restrictions on the physical movement of our employees contract manufacturers component suppliers partners and customers the majority of our global workforce has been working remotely since march 2020 and we continue to follow the guidance of local and national governments for employees who have returned or will be returning to our offices if the covid19 pandemic and corresponding governmental regulations and reopening process have a substantial impact on the health attendance or productivity of our employees partners or customers our results of operations and overall financial performance may be adversely impacted numerous ongoing and emerging regulations in the us and other countries including those regarding covid19 vaccination mandates and ongoing testing requirements may also negatively impact our operations and increase the complexity of managing the pandemic 

moreover the conditions caused by the pandemic may affect the overall demand environment for our products and services and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our products or services or to make payments on existing contracts with us either delay or accelerate customers’ purchasing decisions delay the provisioning of our offerings lengthen payment terms lengthen delivery times or affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our future sales operating results and overall financial performance further the pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our ability to provide or deliver products and onsite services to our customers for example the covid19 pandemic has caused us to experience supply constraints due to both constrained manufacturing capacity as well as shortages of component parts as our component vendors also faced manufacturing challenges this has resulted in extended leadtimes to our customers and increased logistics costs which has negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue and decreased our gross margins for these periods and may impact our ability to convert backlog into revenue our backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results because a customer may place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed and then cancel an order without significant penalty challenges to our supply chain due to the impact of the pandemic remain dynamic including ongoing shortages of component parts and we continue to experience increased logistics costs due to air travel and transport restrictions that limit the availability of flights on which we are able to ship products additionally cost increases and extended shipping times for ocean transit have increased our dependence on highercost air freight 

the impact from the covid19 pandemic on our business depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time such as the transmission rate and geographic spread of the disease and its variants the worldwide distribution and acceptance of vaccines and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and vendors if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively and if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy or the industries in which we operate do not improve or worsen from present levels our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could continue to be adversely affected 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our securities could be negatively affected our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products and services that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate include but are not limited to 

• unpredictable ordering patterns and limited visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue 

• changes in our customer mix the mix of products and services sold and the geographies in which our products and services are sold 

• changes in the demand for our products and services including seasonal fluctuations in customer spending 

table of contents 

• changing market and economic conditions including rising interest rates and inflationary pressures such as those pressures the market is currently experiencing that could make our solutions more expensive or could increase our costs for materials supplies and services 

• ability to fulfill orders received in a timely manner due to disruptions and shortages in our global supply chain 

• increased advance ordering by customers of our products due to industrywide supply chain concerns and our increased lead times 

• price and product competition 

• ineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries 

• how well we execute on our strategy and business model 

• financial stability of our customers including the solvency of private sector customers which may be impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

• statutory authority for government customers to purchase goods and services 

• executive orders tariffs changes in laws or regulations and accounting rules or interpretations thereof 

• regional economic and political conditions which may be aggravated by unanticipated global events and 

• disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by among other things terrorism or other intentional acts outbreaks of disease such as the covid19 pandemic or earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters and other unanticipated extraordinary externalities including extreme weather conditions due to climate change that increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be in some prior periods our operating results have been below our guidance our longterm financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors this may happen again and the price of our common stock may decline in addition our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time our product and service gross margins are expected to vary and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including but not limited to customer vertical product and geographic mix shifts an increase or decrease in our software sales or services we provide increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete modifications to our pricing strategy to gain footprint in markets or with customers currency fluctuations that impact our costs or the cost of our products and services to our customers inflation increases in material labor logistics warranty costs or inventory carrying costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers issues with manufacturing or component availability issues relating to the distribution of our products and provision of our services quality or efficiencies increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inaccurately forecasting product demand warranty related issues the impact of tariffs or our introduction of new products and enhancements or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

we derive a material portion of our revenues from a limited number of our customers and our customers compete in industries that continue to experience consolidation a material portion of our net revenues across each customer vertical depends on sales to a limited number of customers if such customers change their business requirements or focus vendor selection project prioritization or purchasing behavior or are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay suspend reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or services and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business and financial results could be harmed the markets that we serve are rapidly evolving and highly competitive and include a number of wellestablished companies we also compete with other public and private companies that are developing competing technologies to our products in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition by or of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all our partners and resellers generally sell or resell competing products on a nonexclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete which could also adversely affect our business several of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do other competitors have become more integrated including through consolidation and vertical integration and offer a broader range of products and services which could make their solutions more attractive to our customers many of our competitors also sell networking products as bundled solutions with other it products if we are unable to compete effectively against existing or future competitors we could experience a loss in market share and a reduction in revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or uncertainty customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses and to make decisions about future investments in addition economic instability or uncertainty continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other events beyond our control such as the covid19 pandemic have and may continue to put pressure on economic conditions which has led and could lead to reduced demand for our products delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects andor higher costs of production future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions from time to time we have increased investment in our business by increasing headcount acquiring companies and increasing our investment in research and development sales and marketing and other parts of our business conversely in the last few years and in 2021 we have initiated restructuring plans to realign our workforce as a result of organizational and leadership changes which resulted in restructuring charges our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives is subject to many estimates and assumptions which are subject to uncertainties if our estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our acquisitions or divestitures of businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and equity issued as consideration for acquisitions may dilute the ownership of our stockholders we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business and invest significant resources to integrate the businesses we acquire the success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the business opportunities and manage numerous risks including but not limited to problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs higher operating expenses liabilities litigation diversion of managements time and attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology and the potential loss of key employees customers distributors vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire 

acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control there can be no assurance that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire or that the transaction will advance our business strategy further we may not realize anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions in addition we have divested and may in the future divest businesses product lines or assets these initiatives may also require significant separation activities that could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention loss of employees substantial separation costs and accounting charges for asset impairments no assurance can be given that any acquisitions or divestitures will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders use a substantial portion of our cash resources assume liabilities both known and unknown incur tax expenses record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets as well as restructuring and other related expenses we may incur additional acquisitionrelated debt which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs thereby limiting our ability to borrow any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions 

long sales and implementation cycles for our products and customer urgency related to ship dates to fill large orders may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter we experience lengthy sales cycles because our customers decisions to purchase certain of our products particularly new products involve a significant commitment of their resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process customers design and implement 

table of contents 

large network deployments following lengthy procurement processes which may impact expected future orders following a purchase customers may also deploy our products slowly and deliberately customers with large networks often expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis and place large orders on an irregular basis these sales and implementation cycles as well as our expectation that customers will place large orders with urgent ship dates may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

our ability to recognize revenue in a particular period is contingent on the timing of product orders and deliveries andor our sales of certain software subscriptions and professional support and maintenance services in some of our businesses our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter further we build certain products only when orders are received since the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter remains unpredictable if orders for custom products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period or meet our expected quarterly revenues similarly if we were to take actions or events occur which encourage customers to place orders or accept deliveries earlier than anticipated or our customers were to continue to accelerate ordering of our products in response to global supply constraints extended lead times or other market pressures our ability to meet our expected revenues in future quarters could be adversely affected we also determine our operating expenses based on our anticipated revenues and technology roadmap and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term any failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

in addition services revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue comprising 35 36 and 35 of total revenue in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect our sales of new or renewal professional services support and maintenance contracts to fluctuate due to endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services or those offered by our competitors and reductions in our endcustomers’ spending levels we recognize professional services when delivered and we recognize support and maintenance and saas revenue periodically over the term of the relevant service period 

further we recognize certain software revenues periodically over the term of the relevant use or subscription periods and as a result the related software and support and maintenance revenue we report each fiscal quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue from contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters any fluctuation in such new or renewed contracts in any one fiscal quarter may not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue and could negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters 

risks related to our technology and business operations 

if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure as well as customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services to deploy our products in their networks and ip infrastructures as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the buildout of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when our customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the software and equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure any reduction or suspension of spending on ip infrastructure is difficult to predict and may be due to events beyond our control such as the covid19 pandemic this in turn can make it more difficult to accurately predict revenues from customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer if we are unable to anticipate future technological shifts market needs requirements or opportunities or fail to develop and introduce new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner or at all it could cause us to lose customers substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services and significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we invest in developing products for a market that does not develop it could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products enhancements or business strategies there can be no assurance that any new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

our strategy to expand our software business could adversely affect our competitive position  the success of our strategy to expand our software business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including but not limited to 

table of contents 

• the additional development efforts and costs required to create new software products and to make our products compatible with multiple technologies 

• the possibility that our current or new software products may not achieve widespread customer adoption 

• the possibility that our strategy could erode our revenue and gross margins 

• the impact on our financial results of longer periods of revenue recognition for certain types of software products and changes in tax treatment associated with software sales 

• the additional costs associated with both domestic and international regulatory compliance data protection privacy and security laws industry data security standards and changes we need to make to our distribution chain in connection with increased software sales 

• the ability of our disaggregated hardware and software products to operate independently andor to integrate with current and future thirdparty products and 

• issues with thirdparty technologies used with our software products which may be attributed to us 

if any of our current or new software products or business strategies do not gain market acceptance or meet our expectations for growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected and our competitive position and our business and financial results could be harmed 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to renegotiate our current thirdparty licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms and some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them in addition we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products thirdparty technology we incorporate into our products that is deemed to infringe on the intellectual property of others may result and in some cases has resulted in limitations on our ability to source technology from those third parties restrictions on our ability to sell products that incorporate the infringing technology increased exposure to liability that we will be held responsible for incorporating the infringing technology in our products and increased costs involved in removing that technology from our products or developing substitute technology our inability to comply with maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business and results of operations 

we may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our ability to compete we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents with the scope of the claims we seek or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights we could incur costly product redesign efforts discontinue certain product offerings and experience other competitive harm 

unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that these agreements will not be breached we cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology we are also vulnerable to third parties who illegally distribute or sell counterfeit stolen or unfit versions of our

products which has happened in the past and could happen in the future such sales could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights we may be at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success 

we depend on contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers as well as singlesource and limited source suppliers including for key components such as semiconductors our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as the ability of our manufacturers original design manufacturers and suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of solutions that we offer the large and diverse distribution of our manufactures and suppliers and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business for example there is currently a worldwide shortage of key components such as semiconductor products that has caused us to experience increased prices and extended lead times for certain key components the shortage of semiconductors has caused a significant disruption to our production schedule and may give rise to a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations any delay in our ability to produce and deliver our products could cause our customers to purchase alternative products from our competitors in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected other manufacturing and supply problems that we could face are described below 

• manufacturing issues  we may experience supply shortfalls or delays in shipping products to our customers if our manufacturers experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or if we have to change or add manufacturers or contract manufacturing locations although we have contracts with our manufacturers that include terms to protect us in the event of an early termination we may not have adequate time to transition all of our manufacturing needs to an alternative manufacturer under comparable commercial terms we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future an increase in the expected time required to manufacture our products or ship products including delays due to the manufacturing restrictions travel restrictions and other restrictions to control the spread of covid19 moreover a significant portion of our manufacturing is performed in foreign countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the us including import restrictions export restrictions disruptions to our supply chain cyberattacks pandemics regional climaterelated events or regional conflicts 

• singlesource suppliers  we rely on single or limited sources for many of our components due to technology availability price quality scale or customization needs in addition there has been consolidation among certain suppliers of our components consolidation among suppliers can result in the reduction of the number of independent suppliers of components available to us which could negatively impact our ability to access certain component parts or the prices we have to pay for such parts and may impact our gross margins additionally if certain components that we receive from our suppliers have defects or other quality issues we may have to replace or repair such components and we could be subject to claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses 

• supplychain disruption any disruptions to our supply chain significant increase in component costs or shortages of critical components could decrease our sales earnings and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to an extended closure of or any slowdown at our suppliers plants or shipping delays due to efforts to limit the spread of covid19 market shortages due to the surge in demand from other purchasers for critical components increases in prices the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes or tariffs on components or our products themselves labor stoppages transportation delays or failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods thirdparty interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain cyberattacks the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions adverse effects of climate change natural disasters geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utilities and other services in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of components and products would adversely affect our business 

• component supply forecast  we provide demand forecasts for our products to our manufacturers who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory or raw materials each of which could negatively affect our gross margins if we underestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components

required to produce our products this could increase costs or delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues and could negatively impact customer satisfaction any future spike in growth in our business in the use of certain components we share in common with other companies in it spending or in the economy in general is likely to create greater shortterm pressure on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories if shortages or delays persist we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build and deliver products in a timely manner and our revenues gross margins and customer relationships could suffer 

• alternative sources of supply  the development of alternate sources for components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy for example there is currently a worldwide shortage of semiconductor products that has caused us to experience increased prices and extended lead times on some semiconductor products and we expect these increased prices and extended lead times for semiconductor products to continue for the foreseeable future which may impact our production and delivery schedules or affect the price of semiconductor products also longterm supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may further increase the risk of component shortages or increase the cost of carrying inventory in the event of a component shortage supply interruption or significant price increase from these suppliers we may not be able to locate alternative sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales and would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

• covid19 impact delays in production or in product deliveries due to the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example we have experienced supply constraints due to both constrained manufacturing capacity as well as component parts shortages as our component vendors were also facing supply constraints and increased logistics costs due to air travel and transport restrictions that limited the availability of flights on which we ship our products additionally cost increases and extended shipping times for ocean transit have increased our dependence on highercost air freight these challenges have resulted in extended leadtimes to our customers and have had a negative impact on our ability to recognize associated revenue and has resulted in and may continue to result in an increase in accelerated ordering for certain of our products we continue to work with government authorities and implement safety measures to ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the covid19 pandemic however we could still experience an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain that could impact our operations 

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our and our customers’ proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our employees contractors customers suppliers vendors and other business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy on an ongoing and regular basis we have been and expect to be subject to cyberattacks and may be subject to ransomware and distributed denialofservice attacks spearfishing attacks and other attempted intrusions on our networks and systems by a wide range of actors including but not limited to nation states criminal enterprises terrorist organizations and other organizations or individuals as well as errors wrongful conduct or malfeasance by employees and thirdparty service providers collectively “malicious parties” we expect our thirdparty vendors to be subject to similar cyberattacks ransomware and distributed denialofservice attacks spearfishing attacks and other attempted intrusions the increasing occurrence of highprofile data breaches and ransomware attacks provides evidence of an environment increasingly hostile to information security 

despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information systems infrastructure and data have experienced security incidents and breaches and may be subject to or vulnerable to breaches or attacks including ransomware and distributed denialofservice attacks in the future if any breach or attack compromises our networks or those of our vendors creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities or critical security defects of our products and services the information stored on our networks or the networks of our customers suppliers or business partners could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost destroyed or stolen and we may be subject to claims for contractual tort or equitable liability and suffer reputational and financial harm in addition malicious parties may compromise our software including the opensource software used in our products or our manufacturing supply chain to embed malicious hardware components and software that are designed to defeat or circumvent encryption and other cybersecurity measures to interfere with the operation of our networks expose us or our products to cyberattacks or gain unauthorized access to our or our customers’ systems and information if such actions are successful they could diminish customer trust in our products harm our business reputation and adversely affect our business and financial condition

because techniques used by malicious parties to access or sabotage networks are sophisticated change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques or the vulnerabilities they have caused or other potential vulnerabilities or security defects further when vulnerabilities are discovered we evaluate the risk prioritize our responses apply patches or take other remediation actions and notify customers business partners and suppliers as appropriate exploitation of vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of thirdparty providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could in each case result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

all of this requires significant resources and attention from management and our employees and the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate these issues could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure the market perception of the effectiveness of our products and our overall reputation could also be harmed as a result of any actual or perceived breach of security that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the systems of other vendors andor to actions of malicious parties this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions which could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

additionally we could be subject to measures that regulate the security of the types of products we sell such regulations may result in increased costs and delays in product releases and changes in features to achieve compliance which may impact customer demand for our products and result in regulatory investigations potential fines and litigation in connection with a compliance concern security breach or related issue and potential liability to third parties arising from such breaches further in response to actual or anticipated cybersecurity regulations or contractual security requirements negotiated with our customers we may need to make changes to existing policies processes and supplier relationships that could impact product offerings release schedules and service response times which could adversely affect the demand for and sales of our products and services we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

disruption in our distribution channels could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products and some of which sell their own competing products the loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with our partners develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer we recognize a portion of our revenues at the time we sell products to our distributors if these sales are made based on inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted further our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand 

to develop and expand our distribution channel we continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and have previously entered into oem agreements with partners to rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these relationships require processes and procedures that may be costly or challenging to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products we also depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements any failure by our partners to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we rely on the performance of our business systems and thirdparty systems and processes some of our business processes depend upon our it systems the it systems and processes of third parties and the interfaces between the two for example ibm currently provides us with a broad range of information technology services such as applications including support development and maintenance infrastructure management and support including for server storage and network devices and end user support including service desk ibm provides services to us through cloud providers third party providers and offsite facilities that may be vulnerable to damage or interruption including performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures equipment failure adverse events caused by operator error cybersecurity attacks pandemics and similar events in addition because we lease offsite data center facilities we cannot be assured that we will be able to expand our data center infrastructure to meet user demand in a timely manner or on favorable financial terms if we have issues receiving and processing data this may delay our ability to provide products and services to our customers and business partners and damage our business we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract 

table of contents 

manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay the manufacture and shipment of our products in a timely manner may be impaired since it is critical to our operations in addition to the risks outlined above problems with any of the third parties we rely on for our it systems and services could result in liabilities to our customers and business partners lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price we could also face significant additional costs or business disruption if our arrangements with these third parties are terminated or impaired and we cannot find alternative services or support on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis or if we are unable to hire new employees in order to provide these services inhouse 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel or if our existing personnel were harmed by covid19 our future success and ability to maintain a technology leadership position depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management engineering technical sales marketing and support personnel which may be impacted by various covid19 vaccine and testing mandates as well as our ability to maintain the health of our personnel including during the covid19 pandemic the supply of highly qualified individuals with technological and creative skills in particular engineers in specialized areas with the expertise to develop new products and enhancements for our current products and provide reliable product maintenance as well as the number of salespeople with industry expertise is limited competition for people with the specialized technical skills we require is significant none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term if we fail to attract new personnel or retain and motivate our current personnel the development and introduction of new products could be delayed our ability to market sell or support our products could be impaired and our business results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

a number of our team members are foreign nationals who rely on visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the us and other countries in recent years the us has increased the level of scrutiny in granting h1b l1 and other business visas compliance with new and unexpected us immigration and labor laws could also require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain and attract skilled professionals additionally pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic may interfere with our ability to hire or retain personnel any of these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions 

our business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and esg matters andor our reporting of such matters 

there is an increasing focus from certain investors customers consumers employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and environmental social governance “esg” matters from time to time we may communicate certain initiatives including goals regarding environmental matters diversity responsible sourcing and social investments and other corporate citizenship and esg matters in our corporate social responsibility report on our website in our sec filings and elsewhere these initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement we could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or goals in addition we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals as our required and voluntary disclosures about corporate citizenship and other esg matters increase we could be criticized for the accuracy adequacy or completeness of such disclosures our reputation or other aspects of our business could be negatively impacted by all such matters with potential material adverse effects 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

we are a party to lawsuits investigations and other disputes we have been named a party to litigation involving a broad range of matters including employment matters commercial transactions patent infringement copyrights trademarks and other rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products as well as governmental claims and securities laws and we may be named in additional litigation andor governmental claims for example certain us governmental agencies previously conducted investigations into possible violations by us of the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa which ultimately resulted in the company entering into a settlement with the sec that involved among other things the company making a payment of 118 million in august 2019 future claims or initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers future claims asserted andor litigation may be initiated by third parties including whistleblowers and may relate to infringement of proprietary rights issues arising under the false claims act compliance with securities laws or other matters the expense of initiating and defending and in some cases settling such litigation and investigations may be costly and may cause us to suffer reputational harm divert management’s attention from daytoday operations of our business and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could disrupt our business operations results of operations financial condition or cash flows in addition if we fail to comply with the terms of any settlement agreement we could face more substantial penalties an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

further increased patent litigation brought by nonpracticing entities may result and in some cases has resulted in our customers requesting or requiring us to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the merit of these claims they may require us to develop alternative technologies enter into license 

table of contents 

agreements or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services furthermore even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled at significant costs to us because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief 

if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us or anyone we are required to indemnify is successful and we are required to pay significant monetary awards or damages to settle litigation enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers or we fail to develop noninfringing technology and we incorporate infringing technology in our products our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

nonstandard contract terms with telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies and other large customers including large enterprise customers could have an adverse effect on our business or impact the amount of revenues to be recognized telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies and other large companies including large enterprise customers generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the amount or timing of or our ability to recognize revenue increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms from us 

in addition other vendors may have promised but failed to deliver certain functionality to these types of customers andor had products that caused problems or outages in their networks for these or other reasons these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or for any network outages that may or may not have been caused by our products if we are required to agree to these requests or incur penalties the amount of revenue recognized from such sales may be negatively impacted and as a result may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulations of our industry or of our customers could harm our operating results and future prospects we are subject to laws regulations and policies affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas for example some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet countryspecific safety conformance or security certification criteria or incountry test requirements other regulations that may negatively impact our business include local content or local manufacturing requirements most commonly applicable for government stateowned enterprise or regulated industry procurements these types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the sec requires us as a public company who uses certain raw materials that are considered to be “conflict minerals” in our products to report publicly on the extent to which “conflict minerals” are in our supply chain as a provider of hardware endproducts we are several steps removed from the mining smelting or refining of any conflict minerals accordingly our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of these raw materials is limited our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as “conflictfree” we may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements 

environmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment may adversely impact our business and financial condition in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and material composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation which could require us to cease selling noncompliant products and to reengineer our products to use compliant components which could result in additional costs to us disrupt our operations and result in an adverse impact on our operating results if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

in addition as a contractor and subcontractor to the us government we are subject to federal regulations pertaining to our it systems that require compliance with certain security and privacy controls failure to comply with these requirements could result in a loss of federal government business subject us to claims or other remedies for noncompliance or negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

further some governments and government agencies have implemented and could continue to implement procurement policies that impact our profitability procurement policies favoring more noncommercial purchases different pricing or evaluation criteria or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer’s view of what our pricing should be could affect 

table of contents 

the margins on such contracts or make it more difficult to compete on certain types of programs moreover the failure to comply with government contracting provisions could result in penalties or the ineligibility to compete for future contracts governments and government agencies are continually evaluating their contract pricing and financing practices and we have no assurance regarding what changes will be proposed if any and their impact on our financial position cash flows or results of operations 

moreover our customers in the telecommunications industry may be subject to regulations and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations affecting our customers further we could be affected by new laws or regulations on access to or commerce on ip networks in jurisdictions where we market our solutions regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers needs for products also many jurisdictions have or are evaluating and implementing regulations relating to cybersecurity supply chain integrity privacy and data protection any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment additionally certain countries where our customers operate may require that our products sold in that country be made locally or made in particular geographies or satisfy local regulations for critical infrastructure projects either of which could impact our ability to compete in those markets and may also negatively impact our margins due to the costs incurred to comply with these requirements 

the adoption and implementation of additional regulations could reduce demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products result in product inventory writeoffs impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner require us to spend significant time and expense to comply with and subject us to fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

governmental regulations economic sanctions and other legal restrictions that affect international trade or affect movement and disposition of our products and component parts could negatively affect our revenues and operating results the us and other governments have imposed restrictions on the import and export of among other things certain telecommunications products and components particularly those that contain or use encryption technology most of our products are telecommunications products that contain or use encryption technology and consequently are subject to restrictions the scope nature and severity of such controls vary widely across different countries and may change frequently over time in many cases these government restrictions require a license prior to importing or exporting a good such licensing requirements can introduce delays into our operations as we or our channel partners must apply for the license and wait for government officials to process it or perform preshipment inspections it is possible that lengthy delays will lead to the cancellation of orders by customers moreover if we our suppliers or our channel partners fail to obtain necessary licenses prior to importing or exporting covered goods we can be subject to government sanctions including monetary penalties conditions and restrictions such license requirements and any fines or other sanctions imposed for their violation could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 

in addition the us and other governments have especially broad sanctions and embargoes prohibiting provision of goods or services to certain countries territories sanctioned governments businesses and individuals we have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into restricted countries or to prohibited entities or individuals but there can be no assurance that our third party downstream resellers and distributors will abide by these restrictions or have processes in place to ensure compliance 

certain governments also impose special local content certification testing source code review escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys or other cybersecurity feature requirements to protect network equipment and software procured by or for the government similar requirements also may be imposed in procurements by state owned entities or even private companies forming part of “critical network infrastructure” or supporting sensitive industries 

in recent years us government officials have had concerns with the security of products and services from certain telecommunications and video providers based in china russia and other regions as a result congress has enacted bans on the use of certain chineseorigin components or systems either in items sold to the us government or in the internal networks of government contractors and subcontractors even if those networks are not used for governmentrelated projects us regulations also permit the us government to investigate and possibly mandate the unwinding of commercial transactions between us companies and foreign suppliers this introduces uncertainty into our supply chain our imports of end products and our overall operational planning 

in may 2021 the us president issued an executive order on cybersecurity that signals the us government’s interest in developing standards and guidelines pertaining to information and communication technology supply chains government network capabilities and requirements and cyber threat and vulnerability remediation any or all of these standards and guidelines could impact how we develop hardware and software what features our products have and our role in helping the us government respond to cyber threats and vulnerabilities

our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations a wide variety of provincial state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these privacy and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving extensive and complex compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development and offering of new products and services in addition the interpretation and application of privacy and data protectionrelated laws in some cases is uncertain and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes including the potential for various regulator or other governmental bodies to enact new or additional laws or regulations to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties moreover there are a number of other legislative proposals worldwide including in the us at both the federal and state level that could impose additional and potentially conflicting obligations in areas affecting our business examples of recent and anticipated developments that have or could impact our business include the following 

• the general data protection regulation imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides significant penalties for noncompliance we have relied on the use of standard contractual clauses approved by the european union “eu” commission to legitimize the transfer of personal data outside of the eu to certain jurisdictions including the us the standard contractual clauses have been subject to legal challenge in relation to the “schrems ii” decision by the court of justice of the eu on july 16 2020 and its impact on our data transfer mechanism we may experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens and new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing of data on our behalf further in june 2021 the eu issued new standard contractual clauses that we will need to enter into with our customers which will cause us to incur costs and allocate resources in order to manage the contract updating process we may face reluctance or resistance by our current and prospective customers to use our products and services we may also find it necessary to make further changes to our handling of personal data of residents of the european economic area “eea” the regulatory environment applicable to the handling of eea residents’ personal data and our actions in addressing such environment may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business operating results and financial condition being harmed in addition we and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the eea relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the eea any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

• data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the us at both the federal and state level the effects of the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective and enforceable in 2020 and other similar laws may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies adapt our goods and services and incur substantial costs and expenses to comply the ccpa also provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches that may increase the frequency and cost associated with data breach litigation further the new california privacy rights act “cpra” which was passed in november 2020 and will come into effect on january 1 2023 with a “lookback” period to january 1 2022 significantly modifies the ccpa likewise both virginia and colorado provide similar rights in the virginia consumer data protection act which will take effect on january 1 2023 and the colorado privacy act which will take effect on july 1 2023 these modifications and any new legislation may result in additional uncertainty and require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply 

• the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data in addition we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored within that country 

• both us and nonus governments are considering regulating artificial intelligence “ai” and machine learning which may impact our products and services and cause us to incur costs and expenses in order to comply specifically the eu recently published a draft ai regulation if passed the new law would cause us to incur costs and expenses in order to comply 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data or to protect personal data from unauthorized access use or other processing could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals fines damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business further evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the eu the us uk and elsewhere including the classification of ip addresses machine identification information location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting business relationships and partnerships that may involve the sharing or uses of data and may require significant costs resources and efforts in order to comply

financial risks 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets as of december 31 2021 our goodwill was 37621 million and our purchased intangible assets were 2843 million we are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill annually or in certain instances more frequently and may be required to record impairment charges which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis if the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets however any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in effective tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results our future effective tax rates and the amount of our taxable income could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by the following earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the research and development “rd” tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement costs related to intercompany restructuring tax effects of sharebased compensation challenges to our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof our future effective tax rate may be impacted by judicial decisions changes in interpretation of regulations as well as additional legislation and guidance 

proposals to reform us and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the us corporate tax rate although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals may become law several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate income tax expense and cash flows further the organisation for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” an international association of 38 countries including the us has issued guidelines that change longstanding tax principles the oecd guidelines may introduce tax uncertainty as countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the guidelines some countries have enacted and others have proposed taxes based on gross receipts applicable to digital services regardless of profitability recently substantially all member countries of the oecdg20 inclusive framework agreed to certain tax principles including a global minimum tax of 15 additional changes to global tax laws are likely to occur and such changes may adversely affect our tax liability 

in addition we are generally subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes but the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the us in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the us as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic business regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including the following 

• changes in general it spending 

• the impact of the covid19 pandemic and any other adverse public health developments epidemic disease or other pandemic in the countries in which we operate or where our customers are located 

• the imposition of government controls inclusive of critical infrastructure protection 

• changes in trade controls economic sanctions or other international trade regulations which may affect our ability to import or export our products to or from various countries 

• laws that restrict sales of products that are developed manufactured or incorporate components or assemblies sourced from certain countries or suppliers to specific customers eg us federal government departments and agencies and industry segments or for particular uses 

table of contents 

• varying and potentially conflicting laws and regulations changes in laws and interpretation of laws misappropriation of intellectual property and reduced intellectual property protection 

• political uncertainty including demonstrations that could have an impact on product delivery 

• fluctuations in local economies including inflationary conditions that could make our solutions more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information 

• tax policies treaties or laws that could have an unfavorable business impact 

• the negotiation and implementation of free trade agreements between the us and other nations 

• data privacy rules and other regulations that affect cross border data flow and 

• theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and other confidential business information 

any or all of these factors has or could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the us or in other countries in which we operate in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations certain countries such as russia china and eu member nations with regard to iran trade prohibit individuals and companies resident in or operating within their borders to comply with foreign sanctions imposed on such countries themselves or on third countries there can be no assurance that our employees contractors channel partners and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in termination of our relationship financial reporting problems fines andor penalties for us or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness as of december 31 2021 we had 17000 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes which we refer to collectively as the “notes” in april 2019 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” with certain institutional lenders that provides for a fiveyear 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our indebtedness including the notes our ability to pay our expenses satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures is dependent upon our future performance and other factors discussed in this section however there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

the indenture that governs the notes contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things incur liens incur sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge with or into or sell substantially all of our assets to another person further the credit agreement contains two financial covenants along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following 

• maintenance of a leverage ratio no greater than 30x provided that if a material acquisition has been consummated we are permitted to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 35x for up to four quarters and an interest coverage ratio no less than 30x and 

• covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to among other things grant liens merge or consolidate dispose of all or substantially all of its assets change their accounting or reporting policies change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business in addition under applicable us tax laws and regulations there are limitations on the deductibility of net business interest expenses as a result if our taxable income were to decline we may not be able to fully deduct our net interest expense which could have a material impact on our business 

further we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the us factors that influence our credit ratings include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

table of contents 

our investments are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments we have substantial investments in assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities money market funds mutual funds time deposits us government agency securities and us government securities we also have investments in privatelyheld companies certain of our investments are subject to general credit liquidity market sovereign debt and interest rate risks our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value related to creditworthiness of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be material in addition should financial market conditions worsen in the future investments in some financial instruments may be subject to risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

the elimination of libor after june 2023 may affect our financial results all libor tenors which are relevant to the company will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after june 30 2023 and therefore any of our liborbased borrowings and interest rate derivatives that extend beyond june 30 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate 

general risk factors 

failing to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes or any weaknesses in our internal controls may adversely affect investor perception and our stock price we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures to manage and grow our business effectively in the future we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to not be effective resulting in a material weakness investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could have a material and adverse impact on our business

• net revenues net revenues increased during 2021 compared to 2020 across all of our verticals customer solutions and geographies service net revenues increased primarily due to strong sales of hardware maintenance and software subscriptions 

• gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was flat during 2021 compared to 2020 product gross margin decreased primarily due to higher intangible amortization associated with the acquisitions of apstra 128 technology and netrounds and to a lesser extent logistics and other supply chain costs related to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by favorable product and software mix and higher volume the decrease in product gross margin was offset by the increase in service gross margin which was primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs 

table of contents 

• operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily from the drivers described in the gross margin discussion above and lower restructuring charges the increase in operating margin was partially offset by higher personnelrelated costs 

• operating cash flows net cash provided by operations increased primarily due to higher invoicing activity partially offset by higher supplier payments and higher payments for employee compensation 

• capital return we continue to return capital to our stockholders during 2021 we repurchased a total of 157 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of 2756 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 4333 million during 2021 we paid quarterly dividends of 020 per share for an aggregate amount of 2591 million

covid19 pandemic update 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the containment measures taken by governments and businesses are expected to continue to have a substantial negative impact on businesses around the world and on global regional and national economies as a result the pandemic has and may continue to negatively affect our operations including as a result of external factors beyond our control such as restrictions on the physical movement of our employees contract manufacturers component suppliers partners and customers the majority of our global workforce has been working remotely since march 2020 and we continue to implement our fourphased approach to office reopening in order to maximize the protection of the health and safety of our employees working in our offices in the us and india during the current voluntary return to office period subject to certain exceptions we require all personnel working onsite in these offices or traveling for business on behalf of juniper to be fully vaccinated against covid19 we also require proof of vaccination for employees and guests returning to our sites where permitted by local laws and regulations we will continue to follow the guidance of local and national governments including monitoring the health of our employees who have returned or will be returning to our offices numerous ongoing emerging governmental regulations in the us and other countries including those regarding vaccination mandates and ongoing testing requirements may negatively impact our operations and increase the complexity of managing the pandemic 

we continue to support healthy customer demand for our products by working with our suppliers and distributors to address supply chain disruptions as well as travel restrictions that have impacted our operations we have a global supply chain which consists of primary manufacturing partners and component suppliers during 2021 the supply constraints we continued to experience were due to both constrained manufacturing capacity as well as component parts shortages as our component vendors were also facing manufacturing challenges these challenges resulted in extended leadtimes to our customers increased logistics costs and impacted the volume of products we were able to deliver which negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue 

challenges to our supply chain due to the impact of the pandemic remain dynamic and we continue to experience higher costs including logistics costs due to air travel and transport restrictions that limited the availability of flights on which we were able to ship products as well as cost increases and extended shipping times for ocean transit that have increased our dependence on highercost air freight our supply chain team has been working to meet our customer needs by executing on a strong risk mitigation plan including multisourcing preordering components transforming our logistics network prioritizing critical customers working with local government agencies to understand challenges and partnering on solutions that limit disruptions to our operations while ensuring the safety of our employees partners and suppliers 

the pandemic did not have a substantial net impact to our consolidated operating results or our liquidity position in 2021 we continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our shortterm liquidity needs and we expect to continue to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our strong credit ratings in 2021 we did not observe any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the pandemic 

we enter fiscal year 2022 with strong momentum and record backlog across all verticals customers and geographies we continue to work with government authorities and implement safety measures to ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic we continue to experience constrained supply increased logistics costs and accelerated customer demand any of which could adversely impact our business results of operations and

global component shortage 

there is a worldwide shortage of various components including semiconductors impacting many industries caused inpart by the covid19 pandemic similar to others we are experiencing ongoing component shortages which have resulted in extended lead times of certain products and significant disruption to our production schedule we also experienced and may continue to experience increased component costs which have had a negative impact on our gross margin during the past year we experienced strong product orders across all verticals and customer solutions we believe some of the strength was attributable to industry supply chain challenges that were causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed we continue to work to resolve our supply chain challenges and have increased inventory levels and purchase commitments we are working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of recent disruptions outside of our control we believe the extended lead times and increased component and logistic costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters we have taken pricing actions to mitigate the effects of rising component costs and do not expect these actions to have an impact until later in fiscal year 2022 while the situation is dynamic at this point in time we believe we will have access to sufficient supplies of semiconductors and other components and will be able to meet our fullyear financial forecast see the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report for further discussion of this risk

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities note 1 description of business basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

the below accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

• revenue recognition we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while most of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain nonstandard terms and conditions and include promises to transfer multiple goods or services as a result significant interpretation and judgment are sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including 1 whether performance obligations are considered distinct that should be accounted for separately versus together how the price should be allocated among the performance obligations and when to recognize revenue for each performance obligation 2 developing an estimate of the standalone selling price or ssp of each distinct performance obligation 3 combining contracts that may impact the allocation of the transaction price between product and services and 4 estimating and accounting for variable consideration including rights of return rebates price protection expected penalties or other price concessions as a reduction of the transaction price 

our estimates of ssp for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels gross margin objectives internal costs competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles our estimates for rights of return rebates and price protection are based on historical sales returns and price protection credits specific criteria outlined in customer contracts or rebate agreements and other factors known at the time our estimates for expected penalties and other price concessions are based on historical trends and expectations regarding future incurrence 

changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 

• income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we apply the authoritative accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our taxes including the interpretation and application of gaap and complex domestic and international tax laws and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made

the following table presents net revenues from software and security products and services in millions except percentages 



gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



our gross margins as a percentage of net revenues have been and will continue to be affected by general inflationary pressure and a variety of other factors including the mix and average selling prices of our products and services new product introductions and enhancements manufacturing component and logistics costs expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations cost of support and service personnel customer mix as we continue to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers the mix of distribution channels through which our products and services are sold and import tariffs for example our logistics and other supply chainrelated costs have increased due to the covid19 pandemic and global component shortage for more information on the impact of covid19 and supply chain constraints on our business see the “risk factors” section of item 1a of part i of this report  

product gross margin 

product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased primarily due to higher intangible amortization associated with the acquisitions of apstra 128 technology and netrounds and to a lesser extent logistics and other supply chain costs related to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by favorable product and software mix and higher volume we continue to undertake specific efforts to address certain factors impacting our product gross margin these efforts include performance and

service gross margin 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs 

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expenses in millions except percentages 



our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnelrelated costs including salaries and wages commissions and bonuses which we refer to collectively as variable compensation benefits sharebased compensation and travel facility and information technology or it departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount we had a total of 10191 and 9950 employees as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively our headcount increased by 241 employees or 2 primarily from hiring for the sales and marketing organization we expect inflationary pressures to impact operating expense at least for the next twelve months 

research and development 

research and development expense or rd increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs driven by higher variable compensation and sharebased compensation expenses 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense or sm increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs driven by headcount growth higher variable compensation and sharebased compensation expenses as well as higher costs associated with marketing initiatives the increase was partially offset by lower professional services costs and decreased travel expenses due to the covid19 pandemic 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges decreased primarily due to higher severance costs related to voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions recorded under the 2020 restructuring plan partially offset by higher facility consolidation contract termination and other exit costs recorded under the 2021 restructuring plan

loss on extinguishment of debt 

the following table presents the loss on extinguishment of debt in millions except percentages 



in 2021 and 2020 we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of our senior notes maturing in march 2024 and june 2025 the loss primarily consists of a premium on the early redemption and acceleration of unamortized debt discount and fees on the redeemed debt

total other expense net decreased primarily due to lower interest expense related to our debt portfolio partially offset by lower interest income related to our fixed income investment portfolio as a result of lower yields from a lower average portfolio balance 

income tax provision 

the following table presents the income tax provision benefit in millions except percentages 



the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was higher than fiscal year 2020 primarily due to the net difference in discrete items in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 and a change in the geographic mix of earnings for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 and further explanation of our income tax provision see note 13 income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions investments in strategic relationships repurchases of shares of our common stock and payment of cash dividends on our common stock since the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax act we have repatriated a significant amount of cash from outside of the us and plan to continue to repatriate on an ongoing basis we intend to use the repatriated cash to invest in the business support valueenhancing merger and acquisitions or ma and fund our return of capital to stockholders 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments cash generated from operations together with the revolving credit facility and our ability to access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund our operations planned stock repurchases and dividends capital expenditures purchase commitments and other liquidity requirements and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including but not limited to our growth rate the timing and amount we spend to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services the costs to acquire or invest in businesses and technologies an increase in manufacturing or component costs and the risks and uncertainties detailed in the “risk factors” section of item 1a of part i of this report

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  

interest income risk  availableforsale fixed income securities 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are in order of priority to preserve principal maintain liquidity and maximize yield the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility to minimize this risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities which includes assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities time deposits us government agency securities and us government securities at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our availableforsale fixed income securities held as of december 31 2021 and 2020 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points or bps 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate in millions 





interest rate swaps 

the company uses interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed interest rate notes to floating interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor resulting in a net increase or decrease in interest expense these swaps hedge against the interest rate risk exposures of the designated debt issuances as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 the aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swaps was 6000 million and 3000 million respectively as of december 31 2021 the fair value of the interest rate swaps resulted in an asset of 21 million and a liability of 25 million as of december 31 2020 the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps resulted in an asset of 203 million a hypothetical 10 change in the interest rates as of december 31 2021 would not have had a material impact to our operating results or the fair value of the interest rate swaps 

interest rate locks 

the company uses interest rate locks which hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our future debt issuance we record changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges of interest rate risk in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the anticipated refinancing upon refinancing of our debt and termination of the derivative instruments the fair value of these interest rate locks will be amortized over the term of our new debt to interest expense as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 the aggregate notional amount of the interest rate locks was 6500 million as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 the fair value of these contracts resulted in an asset of 450 million and 307 million respectively a hypothetical 10 change in the interest rates as of december 31 2021 would not have had a material impact to the fair value of the interest rate locks

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies these foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately one to four months 

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound chinese yuan euro and the indian rupee approximately 81 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of thirtysix months or less the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was a reduction to operating expenses of 107 million or 02 and of 116 million or 03 for years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively see note 5 derivative instruments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our derivative and hedging activity 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december 31 2021 and as of december 31 2020 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of nonus dollar cash cash equivalents and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10 movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash cash equivalents and investments we would report in us dollars as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 by 370 million or 22 and by 334 million or 14 respectively 

equity price risk 

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies depending on the nature of these investments some can be carried at cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer less impairment and others can be carried at fair value the carrying values of our investments in privatelyheld companies were 1971 million and 2019 million as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively the privatelyheld companies in which we invest can still be considered to be in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privatelyheld companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

• offering network security across every environment—from the data center to campus and branch environments to assist in the protection and recovery of services and applications and 

• offering operational improvements that enable cost reductions including lower administrative training customer care and labor costs 

the following is an overview of the trends affecting the market in which we operate by each of our customer verticals we believe the networking needs for each of our customers will eventually result in cloudbased network architectures for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency 

cloud 

our cloud vertical includes companies that are heavily reliant on the cloud for their business model’s success customers in the cloud vertical can include cloud service providers such as the largest public cloud providers which we refer to as hyperscalers and tier2 cloud providers as well as enterprises that provide saas infrastructureasaservice or platformasaservice 

cloud providers continue to grow as more organizations take advantage of public infrastructure to run their business as their businesses grow we expect they will continue to invest in their networks which dictates the quality and experience of the products and the services they deliver to their endcustomers further as cloud providers begin to adopt new network technologies such as the transition to 400gigabit ethernet or 400gbe we believe this should present further opportunities for us across our portfolio as our cloud customers value highperformance highly compact power efficient infrastructures which we support and continue to develop 

in addition saas continues to be an important factor for cloud providers as their customers such as enterprises prefer to procure and consume product and service offerings via saas models as a result we believe that saas providers will invest in high performance infrastructure because the quality of experience has proven just as important competitively as software features and functions lastly as a result of regulations and the need for lower latency and highperformance networking cloud providers have been transitioning to regional network buildouts or distributed cloud environments to address the increasing demand for services data privacy data protection and consumer rights 

as cloud customers are pushing the envelope in networking our focus on collaboration combined with networking innovation around automation has made us a strategic partner with these customers helping them develop highperformance and lower total cost of ownership networking solutions to support their business 

service provider 

our service provider vertical includes wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators and we support most of the major carrier and operator networks in the world with our highperformance network infrastructure offerings in recent years we have seen increased convergence of these different types of customers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships 

table of conten t s 

service provider customers recognize the need for highperformance networks and leveraging the cloud to reduce costs from their network operations this is dictating a change in business models and their underlying infrastructure which we believe requires investment in the buildout of highperformance networks and the transformation of existing legacy infrastructure to distributed cloud environments in order to satisfy the growth in mobile traffic and video as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including smartphones tablets and connected devices of various kinds 

we expect that network function virtualization or nfv and sdn will be critical elements to enable our service provider customers the flexibility to support enhanced mobile video and dynamic new service deployments we are engaging with these customers to transition their operations to essentially nextgeneration cloud operations as the need for a highly efficient infrastructure to handle large amounts of data along with low latency or minimal delay plays into the need to have a high performance scalable infrastructure in combination with the automation and flexibility required to drive down operational costs and rapid provision applications we consistently deliver leading technologies that transform the economics and experience of networking while significantly improving customer economics by lowering the capital expenditures required to build networks and the operating expenses required to manage and maintain them 

in addition to reducing operating costs service providers are seeking to create new or additional revenue opportunities to support their evolving business models these customers are beginning to deploy 5g which we expect will begin to roll out over the next few years and iot which we believe will give rise to new services like connected cars smart cities robotic manufacturing and agricultural transformation 5g and iot require a highly distributed cloud data center architecture from which services are delivered to the end users and will involve a great degree of analytics and embedded security we expect this trend will present further opportunities for juniper with our focus on delivering a strong portfolio of network virtualization and softwarebased orchestration solutions which position us to deliver on the automation and agility requirements of service providers 

enterprise 

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the worlds most demanding enterprises we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers as well as branch and campus applications our enterprise vertical includes enterprises not included in the cloud vertical they are industries with high performance high agility requirements including financial services national federal state and local governments as well as research and educational institutions we believe that our enterprise customers are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications 

we believe that as our enterprise customers continue to transition their workloads to the cloud they continue to seek greater flexibility in how they consume networking and security services such as payperuse models additionally enterprises are deploying multicloud architectures which require endtoend solutions for managing orchestrating and securing distributed cloud resources as a single pool of resources also we are increasingly seeing a convergence of networking and security resulting in security becoming an embedded capability in every solution that we offer to our customers 

highperformance enterprises require ip networks that are global distributed and always available we are innovating in key technology areas to meet the needs of our enterprise customers whether they plan to move to a public cloud architecture or hybrid cloud architecture which is a mix of public and private cloud as well as a growing number of saas applications 

in 2020 2019 and 2018 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues 

products services and technology 

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of telecom and cable operators as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for servicerich platforms at the edge of the network was created 

we have expanded our portfolio to address multiple domains in the network core edge access and aggregation data centers and campus and branch we have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon systems and software including our junos os and virtual network functions or vnf such as firewall network orchestration and automation to provide a range of hardware and software solutions in highperformance secure networking 

our acquisition of 128 technology represents the next step in our aidriven enterprise evolution we believe 128 technology will enhance our aidriven enterprise network portfolio with its session smart networking accelerating the industry evolution 

table of conten t s 

from networkcentric sdwan solutions to modern usercentric aidriven networks also we believe our acquisition of netrounds which is an endtoend assurance solution for our service provider customers will enhance our automated wan solutions with innovative testing and service assurance capabilities to further simplify operations for service providers and ensure positive enduser experiences further we believe our acquisition of apstra a leader in intentbased networking open programmability and automated closed loop assurance for the management of data center networks will expand upon our data center networking portfolio to advance our vision to transform data center operations 

further our intent is to expand our software business by introducing new software solutions to our product and services portfolios that simplify the operation of networks and provide flexibility in consumption and deployment to our customers across our key verticals our software offerings include subscriptions saas and term or timebased perpetual licenses we believe our software and related services revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase over time as we introduce new software solutions designed to better monetize the value of software functionality in our offerings 

significant product development projects and solutions 

in 2020 we continued to execute on our product and service solution strategy and announced several new innovations including metro edge and core innovations to accelerate service providers’ 5g transformation our metro fabric line expansion includes one and three rack unit acx700 universal metro routers we announced a new edge mpc11e line card in the mx2000 series 5g universal routing platform delivering an increase in line card and system capacity using our penta silicon chip we also announced our new triton silicon enabling endtoend secure connectivity at scale with 400gbe and native media access control security that will be used in the ptx10008 and ptx10016 universal chassis these new solutions will help service providers with their infrastructure transformation to 5g 

also we introduced our nextgeneration cloudready operating system junos os evolved it has the same commandline interface the same applications and features the same management and automation tools as junos os but its infrastructure is entirely modernized which enables higher availability accelerated deployment greater innovation and improved operational efficiencies 

moreover we announced a cloudmanaged version of our sdwan solution our contrail service orchestration now gives enterprises a simple way to manage and secure their wan infrastructure branch lan and wifi networks we also released our ptx10003 router and our qfx5220 switch which are both 400gbe ready 

the following is an overview of our principal product families and service offerings in 2020

sales and marketing 

as of december 31 2020 we employed 2880 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals business development teams systems engineers marketing teams channel teams and an operational infrastructure team is based on both vertical markets and geographic regions 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships as described below 

we sell to a number of cloud and service provider customers directly otherwise we sell to all of our key customer verticals primarily through distributors and resellers 

direct sales structure 

the terms and conditions of direct sales arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders along with acknowledgment of our standard order terms or by direct master purchase agreements the direct master purchase agreements with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

channel sales structure 

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales 

table of conten t s 

we utilize various channel partners including but not limited to the following 

• a global network of strategic distributor relationships as well as regionspecific or countryspecific distributors who in turn sell to local vars who sell to enduser customers our distribution channel partners resell routing switching and security products software and services which are purchased by all of our key customer verticals these distributors tend to focus on particular regions or countries for example we have substantial distribution relationships with ingram micro in the americas and hitachi in japan our agreements with these distributors are generally nonexclusive limited by region and provide product and service discounts and other ordinary terms of sale these agreements do not require our distributors to purchase specified quantities of our products or services further most of our distributors sell our competitors products and services and some sell their own competing products and services 

• vars and direct valueadded resellers including our strategic worldwide alliance partners referenced below resell our products to endusers around the world these channel partners either buy our products and services through distributors or directly from us and have expertise in designing selling implementing and supporting complex networking solutions in their respective markets our agreements with these channel partners are generally nonexclusive limited by region and provide product and service discounts and other ordinary terms of sale these agreements do not require these channel partners to purchase specified quantities of our products or services increasingly our cloud and service provider customers also resell our products or services to their customers or purchase our products or services for the purpose of providing managed or cloudbased services to their customers 

• strategic worldwide reseller relationships with established juniper alliances comprised of nippon telegraph and telephone corporation ericsson telecom ab or ericsson international business machines or ibm nec corporation fujitsu and atos these companies each offer services and products that complement our own product and service offerings and act as a reseller and in some instances as an integration partner for our products our arrangements with these partners allow them to resell our products and services on a nonexclusive and generally global basis provide for product and service discounts and specify other general terms of sale these agreements do not require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products or services 

manufacturing and operations 

as of december 31 2020 we employed 340 people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who manage our supply chain including relationships with our contract manufacturers original design manufacturers component suppliers warehousing and logistics service providers 

our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in china malaysia mexico and taiwan as of december 31 2020 we utilized celestica incorporated flextronics international ltd accton technology corporation and alpha networks inc for the majority of our manufacturing activity our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production including activities such as material procurement surface mount assembly final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to ensure that our products meet internal and external quality standards we believe that these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

• we can quickly ramp up and deliver products to customers with turnkey manufacturing 

• we gain economies of scale by leveraging our buying power with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers when we manufacture large quantities of products 

• we operate with a minimum amount of dedicated space and employees for manufacturing operations and 

• we can reduce our costs by reducing what would normally be fixed overhead expenses 

our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures the components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to agreedupon specifications products are then shipped to our distributors resellers or endcustomers generally we do not own the components title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the contract manufacturers or original design manufacturers location customers take title to the 

table of conten t s 

products upon delivery at a specified destination if the product or components remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period we may incur carrying charges or charges for excess or obsolete materials 

our contracts with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer as applicable may accept purchase orders from us these contracts do not represent longterm commitments 

we also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical components the majority of this inventory is production components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand 

some of our custom components such as asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs to ensure the security and integrity of juniper products during manufacture assembly and distribution we have implemented a supply chain risk management framework as part of our overall brand integrity management system this framework encompasses all aspects of the supply chain as well as enhanced elements specific to security issues applicable to juniper products and our customers 

by working collaboratively with our suppliers and as members of coalitions such as the responsible business alliance responsible minerals initiative and the cdp formerly the carbon disclosure project supply chain program we endeavor to promote socially and environmentally responsible business practices beyond our company and throughout our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted a business partner code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers our business partner code of conduct expresses support for and is aligned with the ten principles of the united nations global compact and the responsible business alliance code of conduct the responsible business alliance a coalition of electronics retail auto and toy companies provides guidelines and resources to drive performance and compliance with critical corporate social responsibility policies its goals are to promote ethical business practices to ensure that working conditions in the electronic industry supply chain are safe that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible by using standard audit and assessment protocols and tools we measure and monitor manufacturing partners’ and direct material suppliers’ compliance to the codes of conduct including but not limited to onsite audits risk assessments cdp climate change and water requests and conflict minerals surveys our corporate citizenship and sustainability report which details our supply chain efforts and business partner code of conduct are available on our website 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under master sales agreements either with our distributors resellers or endcustomers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 our total product backlog was approximately 4196 million and 3411 million respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to our distributors resellers or endcustomers generally within the next six months backlog excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts 

seasonality 

we as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns historically we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter of the fiscal year this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

competition 

we compete in the network infrastructure markets these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to solutions that combine high performance networking with cloud technologies in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc or cisco has historically been the dominant player however our principal competitors also include arista networks inc dell technologies hewlett packard enterprise co or hpe huawei technologies co ltd or huawei and nokia corporation or nokia 

table of conten t s 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco nokia hpe and huawei among others have broader portfolios which enable them to bundle their networking products with other networking and information technology products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition marketing budgets and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

in addition there are a number of other competitors in the security network infrastructure space including palo alto networks inc check point software technologies ltd f5 networks inc and fortinet inc among others who tend to be focused specifically on security solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line 

we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco nokia and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that aim to build products with greater capabilities to compete with our products further there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue which may increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios 

in addition to established competitors a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior and cost effective in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have and also from emerging companies that are developing new technologies although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies there can be no assurance that new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

material government regulations 

our business activities are worldwide and subject us to various federal state local and foreign laws in the countries in which we operate and our products and services are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products to date costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations have not been material to our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position although there is no assurance that existing or future governmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations products or services will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations nonetheless as discussed below we believe that environmental and global trade regulations could potentially have a material impact our business 

environment 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals and substances of concern in products regulations adopted by the european union or eu and china 

juniper’s greatest impact on the environment is through our products and services juniper has an environmental program based on our new product introduction process that supports a circular economy model for environmental sustainability and focuses on energy efficiency materials innovation and recyclability we consider opportunities to minimize resource impacts and improve efficiencies over a product’s life cycle from the materials we use and a product’s energy footprint to packaging and endoflife or eol activities such as reuse refurbishment and recycling for example the juniper certified preowned program offers a broad range of refurbished highperformance network solutions from juniper’s current line and endofproduction hardware portfolios with available juniperbacked warranty and support services 

we are also voluntarily participating in cdp climate change and water disclosures and encourage our direct material suppliers and manufacturing partners to do the same additionally we are a member of the responsible business alliance or rba and have adopted and promote the adoption by our suppliers the rba code of conduct as discussed above in the section entitled 

table of conten t s 

manufacturing and operations  we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to execute on monitor and drive environmental improvements in our global operations and within our supply chain 

global trade 

as a global company the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties us export controls and sanctions laws customs regulations and local trade rules around the world the scope nature and severity of such controls varies widely across different countries and may change frequently over time such laws rules and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals or by requiring us to comply with domestic preference programs laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology or source code unique technical standards localization mandates and duplicative incountry testing and inspection requirements in particular the us and other governments have imposed restrictions on the import and export of among other things certain telecommunications products and components particularly those that contain or use encryption technology most of our products are telecommunications products and contain or use encryption technology and consequently are subject to restrictions the consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally we continue to support open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated crossborder supply chains that are expected to continue to contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements 

for additional information concerning regulatory compliance and a discussion of the risks associated with governmental regulations that may materially impact us please see the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

patents 

as of december 31 2020 we had over 4300 patents worldwide and numerous patent applications are pending patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

licenses 

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products and from time to time we need to renegotiate these licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

the covid19 pandemic has significantly affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to negatively affect our operations including as a result of external factors beyond our control such as restrictions on the physical movement of our employees contract manufacturers partners and customers to limit the spread of covid19 and the availability and acceptance of a covid19 vaccine since march 2020 the majority of our global workforce has been working remotely resulting from shelterinplace requirements and travel restrictions we continue to follow the guidance of local and national governments including monitoring the health of employees who have returned to our offices and limiting the gathering size of employee groups in indoor spaces if the covid19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees partners or customers health attendance or productivity our results of operations and overall financial performance may be adversely impacted 

moreover the conditions caused by the pandemic may affect the overall demand environment for our products and services and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our products or services or to make payments on existing contracts with us delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions delay the provisioning of our offerings lengthen payment terms or affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our future sales operating results and overall financial performance further the pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our ability to provide or deliver products and onsite services to our customers for example during fiscal 2020 the covid19 pandemic caused us to experience supply constraints due to both constrained manufacturing capacity as well as shortages of component parts as our component vendors also faced manufacturing challenges these challenges resulted in extended leadtimes to our customers and increased logistics costs which negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue and decreased our gross margins for these periods while our manufacturing capacity continues to improve we expect several of our component suppliers will remain challenged in the near term further the spread of covid19 has and is likely to continue to affect the shipment of goods globally 

the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic on our business depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time such as the transmission rate and geographic spread of the disease the extent and effectiveness of containment actions the worldwide distribution and acceptance of vaccines and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and vendors if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively and if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy or the industries in which we operate do not improve or worsen from present levels our business operating results financial condition and cash flows could continue to be adversely affected 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our securities could be negatively affected our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 

factors associated with our industry the operation of our business and the markets for our products and services that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate include but are not limited to 

• unpredictable ordering patterns and limited visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue 

• changes in our customer mix the mix of products and services sold and the geographies in which our products and services are sold 

• changes in the demand for our products and services including seasonal fluctuations in customer spending 

• changing market and economic conditions 

table of conten t s 

• price and product competition 

• ineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries 

• how well we execute on our strategy and business model 

• financial stability of our customers including the solvency of private sector customers which may be impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

• statutory authority for government customers to purchase goods and services 

• executive orders tariffs changes in laws or regulations and accounting rules or interpretations thereof 

• regional economic and political conditions which may be aggravated by unanticipated global events 

• disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by among other things terrorism or other intentional acts outbreaks of disease such as the covid19 pandemic or earthquakes floods or other natural disasters and other unanticipated extraordinary externalities 

we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be in some prior periods our operating results have been below our guidance our longterm financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors this may happen again and the price of our common stock may decline in addition our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time our product and service gross margins are expected to vary and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including but not limited to customer vertical product and geographic mix shifts an increase or decrease in our software sales or services we provide increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete modifications to our pricing strategy to gain footprint in markets or with customers currency fluctuations that impact our costs or the cost of our products and services to our customers increases in material labor logistics warranty costs or inventory carrying costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers issues with manufacturing or component availability issues relating to the distribution of our products and provision of our services quality or efficiencies increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inaccurately forecasting product demand warranty related issues the impact of tariffs or our introduction of new products and enhancements or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

we derive a material portion of our revenues from a limited number of our customers and our customers compete in industries that continue to experience consolidation a material portion of our net revenues across each customer vertical depends on sales to a limited number of customers if such customers change their business requirements or focus vendor selection project prioritization or purchasing behavior or are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay suspend reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or services and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business and financial results could be harmed the markets that we serve are rapidly evolving and highly competitive and include a number of wellestablished companies we also compete with other public and private companies that are developing competing technologies to our products in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition by or of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all our partners and resellers generally sell or resell competing products on a nonexclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete which could also adversely affect our business several of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do other competitors have become more integrated including through consolidation and vertical integration and offer a broader range of products and services which could make their solutions more attractive to our customers many of our competitors also sell networking products as bundled solutions with other it products if we are unable to compete effectively against existing or future competitors we could experience a loss in market share and a reduction in revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or uncertainty customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses and to make decisions about future investments in addition economic instability or uncertainty continued turmoil in the 

table of conten t s 

geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other events beyond our control such as the covid19 pandemic have and may continue to put pressure on economic conditions which has led and could lead to reduced demand for our products delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects andor higher costs of production future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions from time to time we have increased investment in our business by increasing headcount acquiring companies and increasing our investment in research and development sales and marketing and other parts of our business conversely in the last few years and in 2020 we have initiated restructuring plans to realign our workforce as a result of organizational and leadership changes which resulted in restructuring charges our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives is subject to many estimates and assumptions which are subject to uncertainties if our estimates and assumptions are incorrect or if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

integration of acquisitions or divestitures of businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and equity issued as consideration for acquisitions may dilute the ownership of our stockholders we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business and invest significant resources to integrate the businesses we acquire the success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the business opportunities and manage numerous risks including but not limited to problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs higher operating expenses liabilities litigation diversion of managements time and attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology and the potential loss of key employees customers distributors vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire or that the transaction will advance our business strategy and we may not realize anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions in addition we have divested and may in the future divest businesses product lines or assets these initiatives may also require significant separation activities that could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention loss of employees substantial separation costs and accounting charges for asset impairments 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders use a substantial portion of our cash resources assume liabilities both known and unknown record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets as well as restructuring and other related expenses we may incur additional acquisitionrelated debt which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs thereby limiting our ability to borrow any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions 

long sales and implementation cycles for our products and customer urgency related to ship dates to fill large orders may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter we experience lengthy sales cycles because our customers decisions to purchase certain of our products particularly new products involve a significant commitment of their resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process customers design and implement large network deployments following lengthy procurement processes which may impact expected future orders following a purchase customers may also deploy our products slowly and deliberately customers with large networks often expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis and place large orders on an irregular basis these sales and implementation cycles as well as our expectation that customers will place large orders with urgent ship dates may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

our ability to recognize revenue in a particular period is contingent on the timing of product orders and deliveries andor our sales of certain software subscriptions and professional support and maintenance services in some of our businesses our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter further we build certain products only when orders are received since the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter remains unpredictable if orders for custom products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period or meet our expected quarterly revenues 

table of conten t s 

similarly if we were to take actions to encourage customers to place orders or accept deliveries earlier than anticipated our ability to meet our expected revenues in future quarters could be adversely affected we also determine our operating expenses based on our anticipated revenues and technology roadmap and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term any failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

in addition services revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue comprising 36 35 and 33 of total revenue in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we expect our sales of new or renewal professional services support and maintenance contracts to fluctuate due to endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services or those offered by our competitors and reductions in our endcustomers’ spending levels we recognize professional services when delivered and we recognize support and maintenance and saas revenue periodically over the term of the relevant service period 

further we recognize certain software revenues periodically over the term of the relevant use or subscription periods and as a result the related software and support and maintenance revenue we report each fiscal quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue from contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters any fluctuation in such new or renewed contracts in any one fiscal quarter may not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue and could negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters 

risks related to our technology and business operations 

if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure as well as customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services to deploy our products in their networks and ip infrastructures as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the buildout of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when our customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the software and equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure any reduction or suspension of spending on ip infrastructure is difficult to predict and may be due to events beyond our control such as the covid19 pandemic this in turn can make it more difficult to accurately predict revenues from customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer if we are unable to anticipate future technological shifts market needs requirements or opportunities or fail to develop and introduce new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner or at all it could cause us to lose customers substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services and significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we invest in developing products for a market that does not develop it could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products enhancements or business strategies there can be no assurance that any new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

further our strategy is to expand our software business the success of our strategy is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including 

• the additional development efforts and costs required to create new software products and to make our disaggregated products compatible with multiple technologies 

• the possibility that our new software products or disaggregated products may not achieve widespread customer adoption 

• the possibility that our strategy could erode our revenue and gross margins 

• the impact on our financial results of longer periods of revenue recognition for certain types of software products and changes in tax treatment associated with software sales 

table of conten t s 

• the additional costs associated with regulatory compliance and changes we need to make to our distribution chain in connection with increased software sales 

• the ability of our disaggregated hardware and software products to operate independently andor to integrate with current and future thirdparty products and 

• issues with thirdparty technologies used with our disaggregated products which may be attributed to us 

if any of our new products or business strategies do not gain market acceptance or meet our expectations for growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected and our competitive position and our business and financial results could be harmed 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to renegotiate our current thirdparty licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms and some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them in addition we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products thirdparty technology we incorporate into our products that is deemed to infringe on the intellectual property of others may result and in some cases has resulted in limitations on our ability to source technology from those third parties restrictions on our ability to sell products that incorporate the infringing technology increased exposure to liability that we will be held responsible for incorporating the infringing technology in our products and increased costs involved in removing that technology from our products or developing substitute technology our inability to comply with maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our ability to compete we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our proprietary rights although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents with the scope of the claims we seek or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights we could incur costly product redesign efforts discontinue certain product offerings and experience other competitive harm 

unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that these agreements will not be breached we cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology we are also vulnerable to third parties who illegally distribute or sell counterfeit stolen or unfit versions of our products which has happened in the past and could happen in the future such sales could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

table of conten t s 

in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights we may be at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success 

we depend on contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers as well as singlesource and limited source suppliers our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as the ability of our manufacturers original design manufacturers and suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of solutions that we offer the large and diverse distribution of our manufactures and suppliers and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business any delay in our ability to produce and deliver our products could cause our customers to purchase alternative products from our competitors in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected other manufacturing and supply problems that we could face are described below 

• manufacturing issues  we may experience supply shortfalls or delays in shipping products to our customers if our manufacturers experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or if we have to change or add additional manufacturers or contract manufacturing locations although we have contracts with our manufacturers that include terms to protect us in the event of an early termination we may not have adequate time to transition all of our manufacturing needs to an alternative manufacturer under comparable commercial terms in the event of an early termination we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future an increase in the expected time required to manufacture our products or ship products including delays due to the manufacturing restrictions travel restrictions and shelterinplace orders to control the spread of covid19 moreover a significant portion of our manufacturing is performed in china malaysia and other foreign countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the us including import tariffs export restrictions disruptions to our supply chain pandemics regional climaterelated events or regional conflicts 

• singlesource suppliers  we rely on single or limited sources for many of our components due to technology availability price quality scale or customization needs in addition there has been consolidation among certain suppliers of our components consolidation among suppliers can result in the reduction of the number of independent suppliers of components available to us which could negatively impact our ability to access certain component parts or the prices we have to pay for such parts and may impact our gross margins additionally if certain components that we receive from our suppliers have defects or other quality issues we may have to replace or repair such components and we could be subject to claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses 

• supplychain disruption any disruptions to our supply chain or significant increase in component costs could decrease our sales earnings and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to an extended closure of or any slowdown at our suppliers plants or shipping delays due to efforts to limit the spread of covid19 increases in prices the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes on components labor stoppages transportation delays or failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods thirdparty interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions adverse effects of climate change natural disasters geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utilities and other services in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of components and products would adversely affect our business 

• component supply forecast  we provide demand forecasts for our products to our manufacturers who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins if we underestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products this could increase costs or delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues and could negatively impact customer satisfaction any future spike in growth in our business in the use of certain components we share in common with other companies in it spending or in the economy in general is likely to create greater shortterm pressure on us and 

table of conten t s 

our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories if shortages or delays persist we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build and deliver products in a timely manner and our revenues gross margins and customer relationships could suffer 

• alternative sources of supply  the development of alternate sources for components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy for example we have experienced extended lead times of up to 50 weeks on some semiconductor products and we expect these extended lead times to continue for the foreseeable future which may impact our production and delivery schedules also longterm supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may further increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in the event of a component shortage supply interruption or significant price increase from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales and would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

• covid 19 impact delays in production or in product deliveries due to the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example during fiscal 2020 the covid19 pandemic caused us to experience supply constraints due to both constrained manufacturing capacity particularly in china and malaysia as well as component parts shortages as our component vendors were also facing manufacturing challenges and increased logistics costs due to air travel and transport restrictions that limited the availability of flights on which we ship our products these challenges resulted in extended leadtimes to our customers and had a negative impact on our ability to recognize associated revenue in each quarter we continue to work with government authorities and implement safety measures to ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the covid19 pandemic however uncertainty resulting from the pandemic as well as the worldwide distribution of the vaccines for covid19 could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain for example a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key supplier or transportation supplier to source and transport materials that could impact our operations 

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our and our customers’ proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our employees contractors customers suppliers vendors and other business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy on an ongoing and regular basis we have been and expect to be subject to cyberattacks and attempted intrusions on our networks and systems by a wide range of actors including but not limited to nation states criminal enterprises terrorist organizations and other organizations or individuals as well as errors wrongful conduct or malfeasance by employees and thirdparty service providers collectively “malicious parties” the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an environment increasingly hostile to information security 

despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure have experienced breaches and may be subject to or vulnerable to breaches or attacks in the future if any breach or attack compromises our networks or those of our vendors creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks or the networks of our customers suppliers or business partners could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost destroyed or stolen and we may be subject to claims for contractual tort or equitable liability and suffer reputational and financial harm in addition malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain to embed malicious hardware components and software that are designed to defeat or circumvent encryption and other cybersecurity measures to interfere with the operation of our networks expose us or our products to cyberattacks or gain unauthorized access to our or our customers’ systems and information if such actions are successful they could diminish customer trust in our products harm our business reputation and adversely affect our business and financial condition because techniques used by malicious parties to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques or the vulnerabilities they have caused further when vulnerabilities are discovered we evaluate the risk apply patches or take other remediation actions and notify customers business partners and suppliers as appropriate 

all of this requires significant resources and attention from management and our employees and the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate these issues could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure the market perception of 

table of conten t s 

the effectiveness of our products and our overall reputation could also be harmed as a result of any actual or perceived breach of security that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the systems of other vendors andor to actions of malicious parties this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions which could have an adverse impact on our financial results these risks to our systems may be increased during the covid19 pandemic as the health of our internal security team members who monitor and address cyber threats and attacks against us and our employees around the world is also at risk 

additionally we could be subject to measures that regulate the security of the types of products we sell such as the california internet of things iot security law sb327 which became enforceable in 2020 such regulations may result in increased costs and delays in product releases and changes in features to achieve compliance which may impact customer demand for our products and result in regulatory investigations potential fines and litigation in connection with a compliance concern security breach or related issue and potential liability to third parties arising from such breaches further in response to actual or anticipated cybersecurity regulations or contractual security requirements negotiated with our customers we may need to make changes to existing policies processes and supplier relationships that could impact product offerings release schedules and service response times which could adversely affect the demand for and sales of our products and services we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

disruption in our distribution channels could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products and some of which sell their own competing products the loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with our partners develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer we recognize a portion of our revenues at the time we sell products to our distributors if these sales are made based on inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted further our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand 

to develop and expand our distribution channel we continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and have previously entered into oem agreements with partners to rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these relationships require processes and procedures that may be costly or challenging to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products we also depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements any failure by our partners to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we rely on the performance of our business systems and thirdparty systems and processes some of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of and it services provided by third parties and the interfaces between the two for example ibm provides us with a broad range of information technology services such as applications including support development and maintenance infrastructure management and support including for server storage and network devices and end user support including service desk these cloud providers third party providers and offsite facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption including performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures equipment failure adverse events caused by operator error cybersecurity attacks pandemics and similar events in addition because we lease offsite data center facilities we cannot be assured that we will be able to expand our data center infrastructure to meet user demand in a timely manner or on favorable economic terms if we have issues receiving and processing data this may delay our ability to provide products and services to our customers and business partners and damage our business we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed since it is critical to our operations in addition to the risks outlined above problems with any of the third parties we rely on for our it systems and services could result in liabilities to our customers and business partners lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price we could also face significant additional costs or business disruption if our arrangements with these third parties are terminated or impaired and we cannot find alternative services or support on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis or if we are unable to hire new employees in order to provide these services inhouse 

table of conten t s 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel or if our existing personnel were harmed by covid19 our future success and ability to maintain a technology leadership position depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management engineering technical sales and marketing and support personnel as well as to maintain the health of our personnel during a pandemic including the covid19 pandemic the supply of highly qualified individuals with technological and creative skills in particular engineers in specialized areas with the expertise to develop new products and enhancements for our current products and provide reliable product maintenance as well as the number of salespeople with industry expertise is limited competition for people with the specialized technical skills we require is significant none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term if we fail to attract new personnel or retain and motivate our current personnel the development and introduction of new products could be delayed our ability to market sell or support our products could be impaired and our business results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

a number of our team members are foreign nationals who rely on visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the us and other countries in recent years the us has increased the level of scrutiny in granting h1b l1 and other business visas compliance with new and unexpected us immigration and labor laws could also require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain and attract skilled professionals additionally pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic may interfere with our ability to hire or retain personnel any of these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions

we are a party to lawsuits investigations and other disputes we have been named a party to litigation involving employment matters commercial transactions patent infringement copyrights trademarks and other rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products as well as governmental claims and securities laws and we may be named in additional litigation for example certain us governmental agencies previously conducted investigations into possible violations by us of the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa which ultimately resulted in the company entering into a settlement with the sec that involved making a payment of 118 million in august 2019 the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights the expense of initiating and defending and in some cases settling such litigation and investigations may be costly and may cause us to suffer reputational harm divert management’s attention from daytoday operations of our business and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could disrupt our business and operations in addition if we fail to comply with the terms of any settlement agreement we could face more substantial penalties an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

further increased patent litigation brought by nonpracticing entities may result and in some cases has resulted in our customers requesting or requiring us to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the merit of these claims they may require us to develop noninfringing technologies enter into license agreements or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services furthermore even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled at significant costs to us because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief 

if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us or anyone we are required to indemnify is successful and we are required to pay significant monetary awards or damages to settle litigation enter into royalty or licensing arrangements or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers or we fail to develop noninfringing technology and we incorporate infringing technology in our products our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition increased patent litigation brought against customers in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in customers requesting or requiring vendors to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

nonstandard contract terms with telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies and other large customers could have an adverse effect on our business or impact the amount of revenues to be recognized telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies and other large companies generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of or our ability to recognize revenue 

table of conten t s 

increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms from us 

in addition other vendors may have promised but failed to deliver certain functionality to these types of customers andor had products that caused problems or outages in their networks as a result these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or for any network outages that may or may not have been caused by our products if we are required to agree to these requests or incur penalties the amount of revenue recognized from such sales may be negatively impacted and as a result may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulation of our industry or those of our customers could harm our operating results and future prospects we are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas for example some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet countryspecific safety conformance or security certification criteria or incountry test requirements other regulations that may negatively impact our business include local content or local manufacturing requirements most commonly applicable for government stateowned enterprise or regulated industry procurements these types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the sec requires us as a public company who uses certain raw materials that are considered to be “conflict minerals” in our products to report publicly on the extent to which conflict minerals are in our supply chain as a provider of hardware endproducts we are several steps removed from the mining smelting or refining of any conflict minerals accordingly our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of these raw materials is limited our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as “conflictfree” we may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements 

environmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment may adversely impact our business and financial condition in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and material composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation which could require us to cease selling noncompliant products and to reengineer our products to use compliant components which could result in additional costs to us disrupt our operations and result in an adverse impact on our operating results if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

in addition as a contractor and subcontractor to the us government we are subject to federal regulations pertaining to our it systems that requires compliance with certain security and privacy controls failure to comply with these requirements could result in a loss of federal government business subject us to claims or other remedies for noncompliance or negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover our customers in the telecommunications industry may be subject to regulations and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations affecting our customers further we could be affected by new laws or regulations on access to or commerce on ip networks in jurisdictions where we market our solutions regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers needs for products also many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cybersecurity supply chain integrity privacy and data protection any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment 

the adoption and implementation of additional regulations could reduce demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products result in product inventory writeoffs impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner require us to spend significant time and expense to comply with and subject us to fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

governmental regulations and economic sanctions affecting the import or export of products or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues and operating results the us and other governments have imposed restrictions on the import and export of among other things certain telecommunications products and components particularly those that contain or use encryption technology most of our products are telecommunications 

table of conten t s 

products and contain or use encryption technology and consequently are subject to restrictions the scope nature and severity of such controls vary widely across different countries and may change frequently over time 

in many cases these government restrictions require a license prior to importing or exporting a good such licensing requirements can introduce delays into our operations as we must apply for the license and wait for government officials to process it it is possible that lengthy delays will lead to the cancellation of orders by customers moreover if we fail to obtain necessary licenses prior to importing or exporting covered goods we can be subject to government sanctions including monetary penalties government restrictions on the import or export of technology can restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products which can affect negatively our revenues and operating results 

in addition the us and other governments have especially broad sanctions and embargoes prohibiting provision of goods or services to certain countries territories sanctioned governments businesses and individuals some of these restrictions have been imposed not just to protect national security but also to protect domestic industries and to achieve political aims we have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into restricted countries or to prohibited entities or individuals but there can be no assurance that our third party downstream resellers and distributors will abide by these restrictions or have processes in place to ensure compliance 

certain governments also impose special local content certification testing source code review escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys or other cybersecurity feature requirements to protect network equipment and software procured by or for the government similar requirements also may be imposed in procurements by state owned entities or even private companies forming part of “critical network infrastructure” or supporting sensitive industries 

in recent years us government officials have had concerns with the security of products and services from certain telecommunications and video providers based in china russia and other regions as a result congress has enacted bans on the use of certain chineseorigin components or systems either in items sold to the us government or in the internal networks of government contractors and subcontractors even if those networks are not used for governmentrelated projects the us government also has been considering policies that would limit the ability of businesses to acquire certain goods and services from entities with geographic connections to china russia and other untrusted nationstates including subjecting such acquisitions to government review such proposals if implemented could introduce significant uncertainty into our supply chain and overall operational planning as we would not be certain which potential acquisitions and transactions the government would permit and which it would reject 

in addition governments sometimes impose additional taxes on certain imported products for example the us and chinese governments each have imposed tariffs on certain products including information and communication technology products originating from the other country which resulted in a large portion of our products manufactured in china becoming subject to tariffs on importation into the us depending upon their duration and implementation as well as our ability to mitigate their impact these tariffs could materially affect our business including in the form of increased cost of goods sold increased pricing for customers and reduced sales 

governmental regulation of our ip networking encryption technology and imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or related economic sanctions could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues and operating results in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in harm to our reputation and ability to compete in international markets penalties costs seizure of assets including source code and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or governmentfunded projects 

our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations a wide variety of provincial state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these privacy and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving extensive and complex compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development and offering of new products and services in addition the interpretation and application of privacy and data protectionrelated laws in some cases is uncertain and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes including the potential for various regulator or other governmental bodies to enact new or additional laws or regulations to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties examples of recent and anticipated developments that have or could impact our business include the following 

• the general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides significant penalties for noncompliance we have relied on the use of model contractual clauses approved by the eu commission to legitimize the transfer of personal data outside of the eu to certain jurisdictions including the united states the model contractual clauses have been subject to legal challenge in relation to the recent “schrems ii” decision by the court of justice of the european union and its impact on our data transfer mechanism we may experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens and new 

table of conten t s 

contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing of data on our behalf we may face reluctance or resistance by our current and prospective customers to use our products and services further we may find it necessary to make further changes to our handling of personal data of residents of the european economic area “eea” the regulatory environment applicable to the handling of eea residents’ personal data and our actions in addressing such environment may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business operating results and financial condition being harmed in addition both we and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the eea relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the eea any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

• on january 31 2020 the united kingdom uk withdrew from the european union eu commonly referred to as brexit there is significant uncertainty related to how data flows in and out of the uk will be affected if the uk does not receive an adequacy decision in the next six months we may experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens and new contract negotiations with third parties depending on the outcome of the adequacy discussions 

• data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the us at both the federal and state level the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective and enforceable in 2020 requires among other things covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers regarding the use of personal information gives california residents expanded rights to access their personal information and allows such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information the effects of the ccpa and other similar laws may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies adapt our goods and services and incur substantial costs and expenses to comply the ccpa also provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches that may increase the frequency and cost associated with data breach litigation further the new california privacy rights act “cpra” which was passed in november 2020 significantly modifies the ccpa these modifications may result in additional uncertainty and require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply 

• the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data in addition we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored within that country 

• both us and nonus governments are considering regulating artificial intelligence and machine learning which may impact our products and services and cause us to incur costs and expenses in order to comply 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data or to protect personal data from unauthorized access use or other processing could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals fines damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business further evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the eu the us uk and elsewhere including the classification of ip addresses machine identification information location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting business relationships and partnerships that may involve the sharing or uses of data and may require significant costs resources and efforts in order to comply 

financial risks 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets as of december 31 2020 our goodwill was 36696 million and our purchased intangible assets were 2667 million we are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill annually or in certain instances more frequently and may be required to record impairment charges which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis if the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets however any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results our future effective tax rates and the amount of our taxable income could be subject to volatility 

table of conten t s 

or adversely affected by the following earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement costs related to intercompany restructuring tax effects of sharebased compensation challenges to our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition the tax act made significant changes to the taxation of us business entities which included a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate the current taxation of certain foreign earnings the imposition of baseerosion prevention measures which may limit the deduction of certain transfer pricing payments and possible limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or corporate debt obligations our future effective tax rate may be impacted by changes in interpretation of the regulations as well as additional legislation and guidance regarding the tax act 

furthermore in october 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development an international association of 37 countries including the us published final proposals under its base erosion and profit shifting or beps action plan the beps action plan includes fifteen actions to address beps in a comprehensive manner and represents a significant change to the international corporate tax landscape these proposals as adopted by countries may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

in addition we are generally subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes but the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the us in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the us as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic business regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including the following 

• changes in general it spending 

• the impact of the recent covid19 pandemic and any other adverse public health developments epidemic disease or other pandemic in the countries in which we operate or where our customers are located 

• the imposition of government controls inclusive of critical infrastructure protection 

• changes in trade controls economic sanctions or other international trade regulations which may affect our ability to import or export our products to or from various countries 

• laws that restrict sales of products that are developed manufactured or incorporate components or assemblies from certain countries to specific customers eg us federal government departments and agencies and industry segments or for particular uses or more generally 

• varying and potentially conflicting laws and regulations changes in laws and interpretation of laws misappropriation of intellectual property and reduced intellectual property protection 

• political uncertainty including demonstrations that could have an impact on product delivery 

• fluctuations in local economies 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information 

• tax policies treaties or laws that could have an unfavorable business impact 

table of conten t s 

• the negotiation and implementation of free trade agreements between the us and other nations 

• data privacy rules and other regulations that affect cross border data flow and 

• theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and other confidential business information 

any or all of these factors has or could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the medium and long term consequences of brexit for the economies of the uk and eu member states as a result of the uks withdrawal from the eu remain unknown and unpredictable we conduct business in the eu and the uk as a consequence any one or more medium and longer term effects of brexit including those affecting labor policies financial planning product manufacturing product distribution and those effects we cannot anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our business business opportunities operating results financial condition and cash flows if we are unable to anticipate and adequately address these risks 

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the us or in other countries in which we operate in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors channel partners and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in termination of our relationship financial reporting problems fines andor penalties for us or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness as of december 31 2020 we had 21238 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes which we refer to collectively as the notes in april 2019 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” with certain institutional lenders that provides for a fiveyear 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our indebtedness including the notes our ability to pay our expenses satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures is dependent upon our future performance and other factors discussed in this section however there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

the indenture that governs the notes contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things incur liens incur sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge with or into or sell substantially all of our assets to another person further the credit agreement contains two financial covenants along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following 

• maintenance of a leverage ratio no greater than 30x provided that if a material acquisition has been consummated we are permitted to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 35x for up to four quarters and an interest coverage ratio no less than 30x and 

• covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to among other things grant liens merge or consolidate dispose of all or substantially all of its assets change their accounting or reporting policies change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business in addition under applicable us tax laws and regulations there are limitations on the deductibility of net business interest expenses as a result if our taxable income were to decline we may not be able to fully deduct our net interest expense which could have a material impact on our business 

further we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the us factors that influence our credit ratings include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets

our investments are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments we have substantial investments in assetbacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities money market funds mutual funds time deposits us government agency securities and us government securities we also have investments in privatelyheld companies certain of our investments are subject to general credit liquidity market sovereign debt and interest rate risks our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value related to creditworthiness of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be material in addition should financial market conditions worsen in the future investments in some financial instruments may be subject to risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate or libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect our current or future indebtedness certain of our financial obligations and instruments including our revolving credit facility accounts receivable finance programs and floating rate notes that we have invested in as well as interest rate derivatives that we use as fair value and cash flow hedges are or may be made at variable interest rates that use libor or metrics derived from or related to libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate in 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate our debt arrangements that extend beyond 2021 that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate which may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows in addition the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase out or replacement of libor disruption in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

general risk factors 

failing to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes or any weaknesses in our internal controls may adversely affect investor perception and our stock price we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures to manage and grow our business effectively in the future we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to not be effective resulting in a material weakness investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction the us district court for the district of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings as specified in our bylaws the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could have a material and adverse impact on our business

 dso is for the fourth quarter ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

• net revenues net revenues were flat during 2020 compared to 2019 we experienced growth in our enterprise and cloud verticals which was offset by a decline in our service provider vertical the growth in our enterprise vertical was primarily driven by switching and the growth in our cloud vertical was primarily driven by routing we believe the decline in our service provider vertical was partially due to the covid19 related supply constraints service net revenues increased primarily due to strong renewals of support contracts 

• gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased primarily due to increased logistics and other supply chainrelated costs related to the covid19 pandemic customer and product mix and intangible amortization associated with the acquisition of mist partially offset by the impact associated with higher service revenues 

• operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased primarily due to the drivers described in the gross margin discussion above higher restructuring charges and higher personnelrelated costs the decrease in operating margin was partially offset by lower travel costs due to the covid19 pandemic 

• operating cash flows net cash provided by operations increased primarily due to higher invoicing activity and working capital differences related to customer collections partially offset by higher payments to indirect suppliers and for employee compensation 

• capital return we continue to return capital to our stockholders during the fourth quarter of 2019 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program the asr to repurchase an aggregate of 2000 million in shares under

covid19 pandemic update 

the covid19 pandemic and the containment measures taken by governments and businesses are expected to continue to have a substantial negative impact on businesses around the world and on global regional and national economies as a result the pandemic has and may continue to negatively affect our operations including as a result of external factors beyond our control such as restrictions on the physical movement of our employees contract manufacturers partners and customers to limit the spread of covid19 and the availability and acceptance of a covid19 vaccine since march 2020 the majority of our global workforce has been working remotely due to shelterinplace requirements and travel restrictions we continue to follow the guidance of local and national governments including monitoring the health of our employees who have returned to our offices and limiting the gathering size of employee groups in indoor spaces 

we continue to support healthy customer demand for our products by working with our suppliers and distributors to address supply chain disruptions as well as travel restrictions that have impacted our operations we have a global supply chain footprint with our primary manufacturing partners located in china taiwan malaysia mexico and the united states our component suppliers are more geographically distributed with vendors from many countries throughout the world during 2020 the supply constraints we experienced were due to both constrained manufacturing capacity as well as component parts shortages as our component vendors were also facing manufacturing challenges these challenges resulted in extended leadtimes to our customers increased logistics costs and impacted the volume of products we were able to deliver which negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue and decreased our gross margins 

challenges to our supply chain due to the impact of the pandemic remain dynamic including ongoing shortages of component parts and increased logistics costs due to air travel and transport restrictions that limited the availability of flights on which we were able to ship products in the fourth quarter however we saw improvements in our manufacturing capacity during the second half of 2020 we also believe that we have a robust and fairly flexible supply chain our supply chain team has been working to meet our customer needs by executing on a strong risk mitigation plan including multisourcing preordering components transforming our logistics network prioritizing critical customers working with local government agencies to understand challenges and partnering on solutions that limit disruptions to our operations while ensuring the safety of our employees partners and suppliers 

the pandemic has not had a substantial net impact to our consolidated operating results or our liquidity position in 2020 we continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our shortterm liquidity needs and we expect to continue to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our strong credit ratings in 2020 we did not observe any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the pandemic 

we enter the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 with healthy backlog in our cloud and service provider verticals we intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement safety measures to ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic we may continue to experience constrained supply and increased logistics costs and could experience curtailed customer demand any of which could adversely impact our business results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer liabilities assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our significant accounting policies see note 1 description of business basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

• goodwill and purchased intangible assets we make significant estimates assumptions and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis the purchase price of an acquired entity is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates critical estimates include but are not limited to historical and projected customer retention rates anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base and the expected use of the acquired assets these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets these estimates are based upon a number of factors including historical experience market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company these judgments can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in future periods and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 

goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recorded we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of november 1 st  or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value this initial assessment includes among others consideration of macroeconomic conditions and financial performance if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists a quantitative analysis is performed by determining the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the discounted cash flow and the market approaches the discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results the market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill of our reporting units goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we determined that no impairment of the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units exists see note 6 goodwill and purchased intangible assets in notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

• inventory valuation and contract manufacturer liabilities inventory consists primarily of component parts to be used in the manufacturing process and finished goods intransit and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value in determining the provision we also consider estimated recovery 

table of conten t s 

rates based on the nature of the inventory as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 our net inventory balances were 2219 million and 942 million respectively 

we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 our contract manufacturer liabilities were 152 million and 286 million respectively 

significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory and obsolete material exposures we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and contract manufacturer liabilities which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 

• revenue recognition we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while some of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain nonstandard terms and conditions and include promises to transfer multiple goods or services as a result significant interpretation and judgment are sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including 1 whether performance obligations are considered distinct that should be accounted for separately versus together how the price should be allocated among the performance obligations and when to recognize revenue for each performance obligation 2 developing an estimate of the standalone selling price or ssp of each distinct performance obligation 3 combining contracts that may impact the allocation of the transaction price between product and services and 4 estimating and accounting for variable consideration including rights of return rebates price protection expected penalties or other price concessions as a reduction of the transaction price 

our estimates of ssp for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels gross margin objectives internal costs competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles our estimates for rights of return rebates and price protection are based on historical sales returns and price protection credits specific criteria outlined in customer contracts or rebate agreements and other factors known at the time our estimates for expected penalties and other price concessions are based on historical trends and expectations regarding future incurrence 

changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 

• income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the research and

• loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those involving our ip commercial securities and employment matters which arise in the ordinary course of business we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required

product net revenues decreased due to decreases in security and routing offset by switching 

security revenue decreased primarily driven by enterprise from lower net revenues in our srx product family 

routing revenue decreased primarily driven by service provider and to a lesser extent enterprise from lower net revenues in our mx product family the decrease was partially offset by strength in cloud 

switching revenue increased primarily driven by enterprise and service provider from higher net revenues in our mist product family 

table of conten t s 

service net revenues increased primarily due to strong renewals of support contracts 

gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



our gross margins as a percentage of net revenues have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the mix and average selling prices of our products and services new product introductions and enhancements manufacturing component and logistics costs expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations cost of support and service personnel customer mix as we continue to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers the mix of distribution channels through which our products and services are sold and import tariffs for example we are subject to tariffs on networking components imported from china which are included in products that we import into and sell within the united states in addition our logistics and other supply chainrelated costs have increased due to the covid19 pandemic for more information on the potential impact of tariffs and covid19 on our business see the “risk factors” section of item 1a of part i of this report  

product gross margin 

product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased primarily due to increased logistics and other supply chainrelated costs related to the covid19 pandemic customer and product mix and higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of mist acquired in the second quarter of 2019 we continue to undertake specific efforts to address certain factors impacting our product gross margin these efforts include performance and quality improvements through engineering to increase value across our products optimizing our supply chain and service business pricing management and increasing software and solution sales 

service gross margin 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased primarily due to higher revenue and lower delivery costs

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expenses in millions except percentages 



our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnelrelated costs including salaries and wages commissions and bonuses which we refer to collectively as variable compensation benefits sharebased compensation and travel facility and information technology or it departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount we had a total of 9950 and 9419 employees as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively our headcount increased by 531 employees or 6 primarily from hiring for the research and development and sales organizations and to a lesser extent from the acquisitions in 2020 

research and development 

research and development expense or rd increased 27 million primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs of 263 million driven by an increase in headcount and higher professional services spending of 124 million the increase was partially offset by a decrease in sharebased compensation expense of 152 million lower engineering costs of 143 million due to decreased investments in certain rd projects and lower travel costs of 40 million due to the covid19 pandemic 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased 111 million primarily due to higher acquisitionrelated costs of 105 million mainly for our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2020 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges increased 327 million primarily due to higher severance costs related to voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions recorded under the 2020 restructuring plan

loss on extinguishment of debt 

the following table presents the loss on extinguishment of debt in millions except percentages 



during 2020 we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 550 million related to the early repayment of a portion of our 2024 and 2025 senior notes the loss primarily consists of a premium on the tender offer and acceleration of unamortized debt discount and fees on the redeemed debt during 2019 we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 153 million related to the early repayment of our 2020 and 2021 senior notes 

other expense net 

the following table presents other expense net in millions except percentages 



 

nm  percentage is not meaningful 

interest income primarily includes interest earned on our cash cash equivalents investments and a promissory note issued to us in connection with the sale of junos pulse interest expense primarily includes interest net of capitalized interest expense from longterm debt and customer financing arrangements gain loss on investments net primarily includes losses from the sale of investments in public and privatelyheld companies and any observable changes in fair value and impairment charges recorded on these investments other typically consists of foreign exchange gains and losses and other nonoperational income and expense items 

interest income 

interest income decreased 428 million primarily due to lower yields from our fixed income investment portfolio as a result of a lower interest rates and lower average portfolio balance and to a lesser extent lower interest income as a result of the collection of a promissory note receivable in connection with the previously completed sale of junos pulse 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 116 million primarily due to lower interest rates and savings from our interest rate swap contracts

income tax provision 

the following table presents the income tax provision benefit in millions except percentages 



the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 was lower than 2019 primarily due to the net difference in discrete items unique to fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 in 2020 our effective rate included a 637 million benefit including interest and penalties related to a multiyear recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and a 201 million charge including interest for the cumulative impact of cost sharing for sharebased compensation in 2019 our effective rate included a 254 million benefit including interest related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits pursuant to the resolution of a tax audit and a 75 million benefit including interest for a lapse in statute of limitations 

for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 and further explanation of our income tax provision see note 13 income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates our effective tax rate may also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items see item 1a of part i risk factors of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results 

as a result of recommendations by the oecd on base erosion and profit shifting certain countries in emea and apac have either enacted new corporate tax legislation or are considering enacting such legislation in the near future we expect the effect of these reform measures to potentially impact longstanding tax principles particularly in regards to transfer pricing consequently we expect global tax authorities to increasingly challenge our cost sharing and other intercompany arrangements and the related sourcing of taxable profits in global jurisdictions

summary of cash flows 

the following table summarizes cash flow activity from our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions except percentages 



operating activities 

our primary source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnelrelated expenditures payments for suppliers and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

net cash provided by operations increased primarily due to higher invoicing activity and working capital differences related to customer collections partially offset by higher payments to indirect suppliers and for employee compensation

net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 4162 million net issuance of debt in 2020 compared to 4548 million net repayment of debt in 2019 and 175 million decrease in stock repurchases as discussed below 

capital return 

the following table summarizes our dividends paid and stock repurchase activities in millions except per share amounts

in january 2018 our board of directors which we refer to as the board approved a 20 billion share repurchase program which we refer to as the 2018 stock repurchase program in october 2019 the board authorized a 10 billion increase to the 2018 stock repurchase program for a total of 30 billion 

as part of the 2018 stock repurchase program in february 2018 and april 2019 we entered into two asrs and repurchased 7500 million and 3000 million of our common stock respectively the aggregate number of shares ultimately repurchased of 293 million and 116 million shares of our common stock respectively was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price less an agreed upon discount of 2562 and 2579 per share respectively the shares we received were retired and accounted for as a reduction to stockholder’s equity in the consolidated balance sheets and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share 

as part of the 2018 stock repurchase program on october 28 2019 we entered into an additional asr with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of 2000 million of our outstanding common stock we made an upfront payment of 2000 million pursuant to the asr and received and retired an initial 64 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of 1600 million based on the market price of 2515 per share of our common stock on the date of the transaction in january 2020 the asr was completed and an additional 18 million shares were received for a total repurchase of 82 million shares of our common stock at a volume weighted average repurchase price less an agreed upon discount of 2444 per share the shares received by us were retired accounted for as a reduction to stockholder’s equity in the consolidated balance sheets and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share

as of december 31 2020 we had 619 million included in longterm income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes as a result this amount is not included in the table above 

revolving credit facility 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility which enables borrowings of up to 5000 million with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million subject to the lenders approval the credit facility will terminate in april 2024 subject to a oneyear maturity extension option as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all covenants and no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility

interest rate risk 

  

interest expense risk  availableforsale fixed income securities 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are in order of priority to preserve principal maintain liquidity and maximize yield the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility to minimize this risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities which includes assetbacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities money market funds mutual funds time deposits us government agency securities and us government securities at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our availableforsale fixed income securities held as of december 31 2020 and 2019 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points or bps 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate in millions 





interest rate swaps 

the company uses interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed interest rate notes to floating interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor resulting in a net increase or decrease in interest expense these swaps hedge against the interest rate risk exposures of the designated debt issuances as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 the aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swaps was 3000 million as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps resulted in an asset of 203 million and a liability of 31 million respectively a hypothetical 10 change in the interest rates as of december 31 2020 would not have had a material impact to our operating results or the fair value of the interest rate swaps 

interest rate locks 

in 2020 the company entered into interest rate locks for an aggregate notional amount of 6500 million these derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our future debt issuance we record changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges of interest rate risk in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the anticipated refinancing upon refinancing of our debt and termination of the derivative instruments the fair value of these interest rate locks will be amortized over the term of our new debt to interest expense as of december 31 2020 the fair value of these contracts resulted in an asset of 307 million a hypothetical 10 change in the interest rates as of december 31 2020 would not have had a material impact to the fair value of the interest rate locks 

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies these foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately one to four months

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound chinese yuan euro and the indian rupee approximately 79 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of thirtysix months or less the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was a reduction to operating expenses of 116 million or 03 and of 316 million or 09 for years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively see note 5 derivative instruments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our derivative and hedging activity 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december 31 2020 and as of december 31 2019 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of nonus dollar cash cash equivalents and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10 movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash cash equivalents and investments we would report in us dollars as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 by 334 million or 14 and by 382 million or 15 respectively 

equity price risk 

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies depending on the nature of these investments some can be carried at cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer less impairment and others can be carried at fair value the carrying values of our investments in privatelyheld companies were 2019 million and 1898 million as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively the privatelyheld companies in which we invest can still be considered to be in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privatelyheld companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

strategy 

we deliver highly scalable reliable secure and costeffective networks while transforming the networks agility efficiency and value through automation 

we believe the network needs for our customers in our cloud service provider and enterprise verticals are converging as these customers recognize the need for highperformance networks and are adopting cloud architectures for their infrastructure and service delivery such as large public and private data centers and service provider edge data centers for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency we believe this industry trend presents an opportunity for juniper networks and we have focused our strategy on enabling our customers transition to cloud architectures through the following strategic priorities 

power public and private cloud data centers 

we are focused on continuing to power public and private cloud data centers with high performance infrastructure these data centers are the core of cloud transformation by enabling service delivery in a multicloud environment which is a combination of public cloud private cloud and softwareasaservice or saas delivery we are a recognized leader in data center networking innovation in both software and hardware solutions our junos operating system or junos os applicationspecific integrated circuits or asic technology and management and automation software investments across routing switching and security will continue to be key elements to maintaining our technology leadership and transforming the economics and experience of our public and private cloud customers in 2019 we introduced our nextgeneration operating system junos os evolved it has the same commandline interface the same applications and features the same management and automation tools as junos os but its infrastructure is entirely modernized which enables higher availability accelerated deployment greater innovation and improved operational efficiencies 

our contrail networking provides dynamic endtoend networking policy and control for any cloud any workload and any deployment from a single user interface it translates abstract workflows into specific policies simplifying the orchestration of virtual overlay connectivity across all environments 

connect users and devices securely to the cloud and to each other 

in developing our solutions we strive to design and build bestinclass products and solutions for core edge and metro networking infrastructure for connecting user and devices securely to the cloud and to each other cloud providers and service providers have deployed our product offerings in their wide area networks or wan such as our highly efficient internet protocol or ip transport ptx product which can cost effectively manage incredible capacity from their end users to the data centers from which they deliver value to those customers we also offer a robust portfolio of softwaredefined networking or sdnenabled mx series routing platforms that provide system capacity density security and performance with longevity mx series routers are the key to digital transformation for service providers cloud providers and enterprises in the cloud era our sdn controller for the wan northstar enables granular visibility and control of ipmultiprotocol label switching or ipmpls flows for large networks we are committed to continued investment in cost effective and highperformance ip transport platforms and automation software which forms the basis of these highperformance networks 

build and manage distributed clouds 

our service provider customers are investing in the buildout of highperformance networks and the transformation of existing legacy infrastructure to distributed cloud environments which resides in multiple distributed data centers in order to place applications and services closer to end users such as enabling managed security and lowlatency applications we are committed to this transformation as our service provider customers rearchitect their infrastructure to enable next generation mobile network buildouts or 5g and internet of things or iot service delivery close to their end users we believe our history of experience in both cloud and wan architecture positions us well to partner with our service provider customers in their strategic transformation initiatives our enterprise customers are moving services from their enterprise edge to the distributed edge we believe the next generation of wan for enterprises is about rearchitecting to metrobased cloud hubs that can also host routing and security services transform costs and provide cloud performance 

clouddelivered enterprise 

enterprises are consuming more valueasaservice where value is delivered in the form of cloudbased software and services we have introduced cloud management and security products which enable enterprises to consume cloud infrastructure and services securely we believe the transition to saas presents an opportunity for juniper to come to market with innovative network and security solutions for our enterprise customers which facilitate their transition to cloud architectures 

we believe our understanding of highperformance networking technology cloud architecture and our strategy positions us to capitalize on the industry transition to more automated costefficient scalable networks our acquisition of mist in 2019 accelerated our ability to execute this belief in cloudmanaged aienabled enterprise networking operations 

customer verticals 

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales distributors valueadded resellers or vars and original equipment manufacturers or oems to endusers in the following verticals cloud service provider and enterprise 

further we believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our key customers by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following is an overview of the trends affecting the market in which we operate by each of our customer verticals we believe the networking needs for each of our customers will eventually result in cloudbased network architectures for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency 

cloud 

our cloud vertical includes companies that are heavily reliant on the cloud for their business model’s success customers in the cloud vertical can include cloud service providers such as the largest public cloud providers which we refer to as hyperscalers and tier2 cloud providers as well as enterprises that provide saas infrastructureasaservice or platformasaservice 

cloud providers continue to grow as more organizations take advantage of public infrastructure to run their business as their businesses grow we expect they will continue to invest in their networks which dictates the quality and experience of the products and the services they deliver to their endcustomers further as cloud providers begin to early adopt new network technologies such as the transition to 400gigabit ethernet or 400gbe this should present further opportunities for juniper across our portfolio as our cloud customers value highperformance highly compact power efficient infrastructures which we support and continue to develop 

in addition saas continues to be an important factor for cloud providers as their customers such as enterprises prefer to consume and procure product and service offerings via saas models as a result we believe that saas providers will invest in high performance infrastructure because the quality of experience has proven just as important competitively as software features and functions lastly as a result of new regulations and the need for lower latency and highperformance networking cloud providers are transitioning to regional network buildouts or distributed cloud environments to address the increasing demand for services data privacy data protection and consumer rights 

as cloud customers are pushing the envelope in networking our focus on collaboration combined with networking innovation around automation has made us a strategic partner with these customers helping them develop highperformance and lower total cost of ownership networking solutions to support their business 

service provider 

our service provider vertical includes wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators and we support most of the major carrier and operator networks in the world with our highperformance network infrastructure offerings in recent years we have seen increased convergence of these different types of customers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships 

service provider customers recognize the need for highperformance networks and leveraging the cloud to reduce costs from their network operations this is dictating a change in business models and their underlying infrastructure which we believe requires investment in the buildout of highperformance networks and the transformation of existing legacy infrastructure to distributed cloud environments in order to satisfy the growth in mobile traffic and video as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including smartphones tablets and connected devices of various kinds 

we expect that network function virtualization or nfv and sdn will be critical elements to enable our service provider customers the flexibility to support enhanced mobile video and dynamic new service deployments we are engaging with these customers to transition their operations to essentially nextgeneration cloud operations as the need for a highly efficient infrastructure to handle large amounts of data along with low latency or minimal delay plays into the need to have a high performance scalable infrastructure in combination with the automation and flexibility required to drive down operational costs and rapidly provision applications we consistently deliver leading technologies that transform the economics and experience of networkingsignificantly improving customer economics by lowering the capital expenditures required to build networks and the operating expenses required to manage and maintain them 

in addition to reducing operating costs service providers are seeking to create new or additional revenue opportunities to support their evolving business models these customers are preparing for 5g which we expect to begin to occur over the next few years and iot which we believe will give rise to new services like connected cars smart cities robotic manufacturing and agricultural transformation 5g and iot will require a highly distributed cloud data center architecture from which services are delivered to the end users and will involve a great degree of analytics and embedded security we expect this trend will present further opportunities for juniper with our focus on delivering a strong portfolio of network virtualization and softwarebased orchestration solutions which position us to deliver on the automation and agility requirements needs of service providers 

enterprise 

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the worlds most demanding enterprises we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers as well as branch and campus applications our enterprise vertical includes enterprises not included in the cloud vertical in particular they are industries with high performance high agility requirements including financial services national federal state and local governments as well as research and educational institutions we believe that our enterprise customers are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications 

we believe that as our enterprise customers continue to transition their workloads to the cloud they continue to seek greater flexibility in how they consume networking and security services such as payperuse models additionally enterprises are deploying multicloud architectures which require endtoend solutions for managing orchestrating and securing distributed cloud resources as a single pool of resources also we are increasingly seeing a convergence of networking and security resulting in security becoming an embedded capability in each and every solution that we offer to our customers 

highperformance enterprises require ip networks that are global distributed and always available we are innovating in key technology areas to meet the needs of our enterprise customers whether they plan to move to a public cloud architecture or hybrid cloud architecture which is a mix of public and private cloud as well as a growing number of saas applications 

in 2019  2018  and 2017  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues 

products services and technology 

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of telecom and cable operators as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for servicerich platforms at the edge of the network was created 

we have expanded our portfolio to address multiple domains in the network core edge access and aggregation data centers and campus and branch we have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon systems and software including our junos os and virtual network functions or vnf such as firewall network orchestration and automation to provide a range of hardware and software solutions in highperformance secure networking we have invested in the development of silicon photonics to provide our customers with performance programmability and streaming telemetry while driving down the cost per bit 

further our intent is to expand our software business by introducing new software solutions to our product portfolio that simplify the operation of networks and allow our customers across our key verticals flexibility in consumption and deployment our software offerings include subscriptions saas and perpetual licenses we believe our software and related services revenues as 

a percentage of total revenues will increase over time as we introduce new software solutions designed to better monetize the value of software functionality in our offerings 

significant product development projects and solutions 

in 2019  we continued to execute on our product and solutions strategy and announced several new innovations including metro edge and core innovations to accelerate service providers’ 5g transformation our metro fabric line expansion includes one and three rack unit acx700 universal metro routers we announced a new edge mpc11e line card in the mx2000 series 5g universal routing platform delivering an increase in line card and system capacity using our penta silicon chip we also announced our new triton silicon enabling endtoend secure connectivity at scale with 400gbe native media access control security that will be used in the ptx10008 and ptx10016 universal chassis these new solutions will help service providers with their infrastructure transformation to 5g 

also we introduced our nextgeneration operating system junos os evolved it has the same commandline interface the same applications and features the same management and automation tools as junos os but its infrastructure is entirely modernized which enables higher availability accelerated deployment greater innovation and improved operational efficiencies 

moreover we announced a cloudmanaged version of our sdwan solution our contrail service orchestration now gives enterprises a simple way to manage and secure their wan infrastructure and branch lan and wifi networks we also released our ptx10003 router and our qfx5220 switch which are both 400gbe ready 

the following is an overview of our principal product families and service offerings in 2019

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of support professional and educational services to ensure these services can be locally delivered 

as of december 31 2019  we employed 1802 people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we employ remote technical support engineers onsite resident engineers spare parts planning and logistics staff professional services consultants and educators with proven network experience to provide those services 

platform strategy 

in addition to our major product families and services our software portfolio has been a key technology element in our goal to be a leader in highperformance networking 

our junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers at the heart of the junos platform is junos os evolved we believe junos os evolved is fundamentally differentiated from other network operating systems not only in its design but also in its development capabilities the advantages of junos os evolved include 



 

 

 

 

junos os evolved is designed to improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os evolved helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades 

orchestration and monitoring 

as many of our customers continue moving to programmable and automated network operations managing orchestrating and securing that complex journey can be a challenge network automation is the process of automating the configuration management testing deployment and operations of physical and virtual devices within a network we believe the keys to achieving success with network and security automation includes 

 

 

we are committed to providing solutions to help our customers to optimize their programmable and automated networking operations with the following offerings 

 

 

 

research and development 

we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols software applications and platforms and embedded operating systems as of december 31 2019  we employed 3777 people in our worldwide research and development or rd organization 

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications integrating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings in our products we are leveraging our software asic and systems technology developing additional network interfaces 

targeted to our customers applications and continuing to develop technology to support the buildout of secure highperformance networks and cloud environments we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and provide an enhanced user interface 

our rd process is driven by our corporate strategy and the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our rd team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market 

sales and marketing 

as of december 31 2019  we employed 2704 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals business development teams systems engineers marketing teams channel teams and an operational infrastructure team is based on both vertical markets and geographic regions 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships as described below 

we sell to a number of cloud and service provider customers directly otherwise we sell to all of our key customer verticals primarily through distributors and resellers 

direct sales structure 

the terms and conditions of direct sales arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders along with acknowledgment of our standard order terms or by direct master purchase agreements the direct master purchase agreements with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

channel sales structure 

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales we utilize various channel partners including but not limited to the following 

 

 



partners allow them to resell our products and services on a nonexclusive and generally global basis provide for product and service discounts and specify other general terms of sale these agreements do not require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products or services 

manufacturing and operations 

as of december 31 2019  we employed 340 people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who manage our supply chain including relationships with our contract manufacturers original design manufacturers component suppliers warehousing and logistics service providers 

our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in the united states or us china malaysia mexico and taiwan as of december 31 2019  we utilized celestica incorporated flextronics international ltd accton technology corporation and alpha networks inc for the majority of our manufacturing activity our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production including activities such as material procurement surface mount assembly final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to ensure that our products meet internal and external quality standards we believe that these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

 

 

 

our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to agreedupon specifications products are then shipped to our distributors resellers or endcustomers generally we do not own the components title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the contract manufacturers or original design manufacturers location customers take title to the products upon delivery at a specified destination if the product or components remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period we may incur carrying charges or charges for excess or obsolete materials 

our contracts with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer as applicable may accept purchase orders from us these contracts do not represent longterm commitments 

we also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical components the majority of this inventory is production components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand 

some of our custom components such as asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs to ensure the security and integrity of juniper products during manufacture assembly and distribution we have implemented a supply chain risk management framework as part of our overall brand integrity management system this framework encompasses all aspects of the supply chain as well as enhanced elements specific to security issues applicable to juniper products and our customers 

by working collaboratively with our suppliers and as members of coalitions such as responsible business alliance responsible minerals initiative and the carbon disclosure project or cdp supply chain program we endeavor to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and throughout our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted a business partner code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers our business partner code of conduct expresses support for and is aligned with the ten principles of the united nations global compact and the responsible business alliance code of conduct the responsible business alliance a coalition of electronics retail auto and toy companies provides guidelines and resources to drive performance and compliance with critical corporate social responsibility policies its goals are to promote ethical business practices to ensure that working conditions in the electronic industry supply chain are safe that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible by using standard audit 

and assessment protocols and tools we measure and monitor manufacturing partners’ and direct material suppliers’ compliance to the codes of conduct including but not limited to onsite audits risk assessments cdp climate change and water requests and conflict minerals surveys cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies can report their environmental performance on climate change water and forest programs to institutional investors and customers our corporate citizenship and sustainability report and business partner code of conduct are available on our website 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under master sales agreements either with our distributors resellers or endcustomers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  our total product backlog was approximately 3411 million and 3443 million  respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to our distributors resellers or endcustomers generally within the next six months backlog excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts 

seasonality 

we as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns historically we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter of the fiscal year this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

competition 

we compete in the network infrastructure markets these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to solutions that combine high performance networking with cloud technologies in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc or cisco has historically been the dominant player however our principal competitors also include arista networks inc or arista dell technologies or dell hewlett packard enterprise co or hpe huawei technologies co ltd or huawei and nokia corporation or nokia 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco nokia hpe and huawei among others have broader portfolios which enable them to bundle their networking products with other networking and information technology products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition marketing budgets and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

in addition there are a number of other competitors in the security network infrastructure space including palo alto networks inc or palo alto networks check point software technologies ltd or check point f5 networks inc or f5 networks and fortinet inc or fortinet among others who tend to be focused specifically on security solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line 

we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco nokia and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that aim to build products with greater capabilities to compete with our products further there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue which may increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios 

in addition to established competitors a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior and cost effective in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have and also from emerging companies that are developing new technologies although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies there can be no assurance that new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

environment 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment or weee directive directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment or rohs and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals or reach regulations adopted by the european union or eu and china to date compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however see the risk factor entitled regulation of our industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a of part i of this report for additional information concerning regulatory compliance 

juniper’s greatest impact on the environment is through our products and services juniper has an environmental program based on our new product introduction process that supports a circular economy model for environmental sustainability and focuses on energy efficiency materials innovation and recyclability we consider opportunities to minimize resource impacts and improve efficiencies over a product’s life cycle from the materials we use and a product’s energy footprint to packaging and endoflife or eol activities such as reuse refurbishment and recycling for example the juniper certified preowned program offers a broad range of refurbished highperformance network solutions from juniper’s current line and endofproduction hardware portfolios with available juniperbacked warranty and support services 

we are committed to the environment through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput of key elements in our highperformance network product offerings our products are independently tested by third parties for energy efficiency compliance as an example and part of our continued focus on improving the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput our mx10008 and mx10016 products redefine perslot economics enabling customers to do more with less while simplifying network design and reducing operating expenses by consuming 06w per gigabit of throughput we also released a new line card mpc11e using the penta silicon in 2019 which reduces the power consumption by 40 compared to our earlier generation line card additionally we have redesigned packaging in ways that optimizes costs while minimizing resource impacts 

we are also voluntarily participating in cdp climate change and water disclosures and encourage our direct material suppliers and manufacturing partners to do the same additionally we are a member of the responsible business alliance or rba and have adopted and promote the adoption by our suppliers the rba code of conduct as discussed above in the section entitled manufacturing and operations  we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to execute on monitor and drive environmental improvements in our global operations and within our supply chain 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

patents

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

investments in our securities involve significant risks even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered in the past significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors disclosed by us including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our business operating results and stock price 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

the factors that may cause our quarterly results to vary quarter by quarter and be unpredictable include but are not limited to 

 

for example we and many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending particularly in the first quarter in addition while we may have backlog orders for products that have not shipped we believe that our backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results for a number of reasons including but not limited to project delays changes in project scope and the fact that our customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty furthermore market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products rebates and discounting increased component manufacturing or logistics costs issues with product or service quality including the quality of our components regulatory impacts tariffs and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations such adjustments may be difficult or impossible to execute in the short or medium term 

as a result of the factors described above as well as other variables affecting our operating results we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be in some prior periods our operating results have been below our guidance our longterm financial model or the expectations of securities 

analysts or investors which has at times coincided with a decline in the price of our common stock this may happen again in the future in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could also occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance 

we expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time 

we expect our product and service gross margins to vary both in the nearterm and in the longterm and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors some of which have occurred and may occur in the future including customer vertical product and geographic mix shifts an increase or decrease in our software sales or services we provide increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete changes in the actions of our competitors or their pricing strategies which may be difficult to predict and respond to modifications to our pricing strategy in order to gain footprint in certain markets or with certain customers currency fluctuations that impact our costs or the cost of our products and services to our customers increases in material labor logistics warranty costs or inventory carrying costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers issues with manufacturing or component availability quality or efficiencies increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inaccurately forecasting product demand warranty related issues the impact of tariffs or our introduction of new products and enhancements or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures for example in fiscal year 2019 our gross margin was relatively flat as compared to fiscal year 2018 in fiscal year 2018 our margins decreased as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to lower net revenues and product mix in fiscal year 2017 our margins decreased as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower product net revenues and product mix resulting from the yearoveryear decline in routing revenues our customers architectural shifts and higher costs of certain memory components failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

further while we will continue to remain diligent in our longterm financial objective to increase revenue and operating margins and manage our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue we expect that our margins will vary with our ability to achieve these goals we can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve all or any of the goals of these plans or meet our announced expectations in whole or in part or that our plans will have the intended effect of improving our margins on the expected timeline or at all 

a limited number of our customers comprise a material portion of our revenues and any changes in the way they purchase products and services from us could affect our business in addition there is an ongoing trend toward consolidation in the industry in which our customers and partners operate any decrease in revenues from our customers or partners could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

a material portion of our net revenues across each customer vertical depends on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners changes in the business requirements or focus vendor selection project prioritization financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior including product mix purchased or delays in deployment of our key customers could significantly decrease our sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in recent years there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example centurylink incs acquisition of level 3 communications inc vodafone india’s acquisition of idea cellular ltd and tmobile us incs proposed acquisition of sprint corp which was recently approved by the us justice department and that consolidation trend has continued certain telecommunications companies have also moved towards vertical consolidation through acquisitions of media and content companies such as verizon’s acquisition of yahoo att’s acquisition of time warner and comcasts acquisition of sky if our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay suspend or indefinitely reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or other direct or indirect unforeseen consequences could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or uncertainty customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses in addition economic instability or uncertainty as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the 

world have and may continue to put pressure on economic conditions which has led and could lead to reduced demand for our products to delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects andor higher costs of production more generallyspeaking economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore instability in the global markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the short and medium term uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions 

from time to time we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount acquiring companies and increasing our investment in rd sales and marketing and other parts of our business conversely in 2017 2018 and 2019 we initiated restructuring plans to realign our workforce as a result of organizational and leadership changes align our execution priorities increase operational efficiencies and to consolidate facilities which resulted in restructuring charges in each of these years some of our expenses related to such efforts are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions which are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competition is intense in the markets that we serve the routing and switching markets have historically been dominated by cisco with competition coming from other companies such as nokia arista and huawei in the security market we face intense competition from cisco and palo alto networks as well as companies such as check point and fortinet further a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition by or of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do in addition some of our competitors have become more integrated including through consolidation and vertical integration and offer a broader range of products and services which could make their solutions more attractive to our customers many of our competitors sell networking products as bundled solutions with other it products such as computer and storage systems if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our partners and resellers generally sell or resell competing products on a nonexclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete which could also adversely affect our business 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

a customers decision to purchase certain of our products particularly new products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times both of which may be exacerbated by the impact of global economic weakness may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

the timing of product orders and deliveries andor our reliance on revenue from sales of certain software or subscriptions and professional support and maintenance services may cause us to recognize revenue in a different period than the one in which a transaction takes place 

due to the cost complexity and custom nature of configurations required by our customers we generally build our network equipment products as orders are received the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter remains unpredictable if orders for certain products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter similarly if we were to take actions to encourage customers to place orders or accept deliveries earlier than anticipated our ability to meet our expected revenues in future quarters could be adversely affected 

in addition services revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue comprising 35  33  and 31 of total revenue in fiscal year 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively sales of new or renewal professional services support and maintenance contracts may decline andor fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services or those offered by our competitors and reductions in our endcustomers’ spending levels we recognize professional services as services are delivered and support and maintenance revenue periodically over the term of the relevant service period 

the introduction of new software products and services is part of our intended strategy to expand our software business and certain software revenues may be recognized periodically over the term of the relevant use period or subscription period as a result certain software subscription and support and maintenance revenue we report each fiscal quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue from contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters consequently any fluctuation in such new or renewed contracts in any one fiscal quarter may not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue and could negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of certain software products subscriptions or support and maintenance is not reflected in full in our operating results until future periods also it is difficult for us to rapidly increase such software or services revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from those software subscription and support and maintenance contracts must be recognized over the applicable period 

additionally we determine our operating expenses based on our anticipated revenues and technology roadmap and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services to deploy our products in their networks and ip infrastructures as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the buildout of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when our customers are determining the design 

of those networks and the selection of the software and equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure any reduction or suspension of spending on ip infrastructure is difficult to predict and can make it more difficult to accurately predict revenues from customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products product enhancements and business strategies that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available or strategies are not executed in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements continuous pricing pressures and a constantly evolving industry we may not be able to anticipate future technological shifts market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet such technological shifts needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all for example the move from traditional wan infrastructures towards softwaredefined wan has been receiving considerable attention in our view it will take several years to see the full impact of softwaredefined wan and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine hardware and software elements if we fail to anticipate market requirements or opportunities or fail to develop and introduce new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we invest time energy and resources in developing products for a market that does not develop it could likewise significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products enhancements or business strategies there can be no assurance that new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

in recent years we have announced a number of new products and enhancements to our hardware and software products across routing switching and security the success of our new products depends on several factors including but not limited to component costs timely completion and introduction of these products prompt resolution of any defects or bugs in these products our ability to support these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

the introduction of new software products is part of our intended strategy to expand our software business we have also begun to disaggregate certain software from certain hardware products such that customers would be able to purchase or license our hardware and software products independently which we expect could in time enable our hardware to be deployed with third party networking applications and services and our software to be used with thirdparty hardware the success of our strategy to expand our software business including our strategy to disaggregate software from certain hardware products is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

 

 and changes in tax treatment associated with software sales 

 

 

 

if any of our new products or business strategies do not gain market acceptance or meet our expectations for growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected and our competitive position and our business and financial results could be harmed 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to or disruptions in those relationships or manufacturing processes expected or unexpected may result in delays that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer relationships therefore if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer relationships which could include failing to provide accurate forecasts of our requirements or if one or more of them experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers original design manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future an increase in the expected time required to manufacture our products or ship products such delays could result in supply shortfalls that damage our ability to meet customer demand for those products and could cause our customers to purchase alternative products from our competitors also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers original design manufacturers or the introduction of new products by us would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover a significant portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other foreign countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states including import tariffs disruptions to our supply chain pandemics regional climaterelated events or regional conflicts for example in 2018 the united states imposed a tariff on certain networking products imported from china and in 2019 the united states increased the tariffs on these networking products and expanded the list of products subject to the tariff certain products that we import into and sell within the united states are included on the list of products subject to these tariffs we have incurred increased costs due to our efforts to attempt to mitigate the impact of the tariffs in some cases the tariffs have been passed on and may continue to be passed on to customers resulting in higher prices for our customers which may have reduced or may continue to reduce customer demand for our products or increased cost of goods sold similarly many of the products that we source from china are transported by air cargo from hong kong which has experienced recent political demonstrations that have resulted in cancellations or delays in flights in and out of hong kong if these demonstrations and their impact on air shipments continue we could experience delays in product deliveries or be required to change our shipping practices in addition increased costs of production or delays in production caused by any relocation of contract manufacturing facilities or delays in product deliveries could impact the global competitiveness of our products each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further the chinese government has recently imposed certain restrictions on the movement of people and goods including the temporary closure of factories businesses schools and public spaces to limit the spread of covid19 in and around wuhan and may extend these restrictions to other affected regions while our products are not manufactured in wuhan any delay in production or delivery of our products or components made in china by our suppliers due to an extended closure of our suppliers plants or other restrictions imposed to limit the spread of covid19 could adversely impact our business in addition a number of countries have either closed their borders completely or implemented immigration restrictions for visitors traveling from china 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers including for key components which makes us susceptible to shortages quality issues or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

we rely on single or limited sources for many of our components during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited for example we have experienced industrywide supply constraints related to power management components in addition some components used in our networking solutions have in the past and may in the future experience extended lead times and higher pricing given the demand in the market any future spike in growth in our business the use of certain components we share in common with other companies in it spending or the economy in general is likely to create greater shortterm pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories if shortages or delays persist we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build and deliver products in a timely manner and our revenues gross margins and customer relationships could suffer additionally if certain components that we receive from our suppliers have defects or other quality issues we may have to replace or repair such components and we could be subject to claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims we have experienced and from timetotime may experience component shortages or quality issues that resulted or could result in delays of product shipments revenue charges that impact our gross margins andor warranty or other claims or costs we also currently purchase numerous key components including asics and other semiconductor chips from single or limited sources and many of our component suppliers are concentrated in china and korea in addition there has been consolidation 

among certain suppliers of our components for example globalfoundries acquired ibm’s semiconductor manufacturing business avago technologies limited acquired broadcom corporation intel corporation acquired altera corporation altera and cisco has announced its intent to acquire acacia communications inc consolidation among suppliers can result in the reduction of the number of independent suppliers of components available to us which could negatively impact our ability to access certain component parts or the prices we have to pay for such parts which may impact our gross margins in addition our suppliers may determine not to continue a business relationship with us for other reasons that may be beyond our control or may seek to impose significant price increases any disruptions to our supply chain or significant increase in components cost could decrease our sales earnings and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to an extended closure of or any slowdown at our suppliers plants or shipping delays due to efforts to limit the spread of covid19 increases in wages that drive up prices the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes on components labor stoppages transportation failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods thirdparty interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions adverse effects of climate change natural disasters civil unrest military conflicts geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services 

the development of alternate sources for components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules also longterm supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may further increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in the event of a component shortage supply interruption or significant price increase from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of components and products would adversely affect our business 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

we provide demand forecasts for our products to our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our original design or contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins for example in certain prior quarters our gross margins were reduced as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand in addition some optical modules we use are experiencing faster product transitions than our other products which increases the risk that we could have excess inventory of those modules conversely lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time given that our contract manufacturers are thirdparty manufacturers for numerous other companies if we underestimate our requirements as we have in certain prior quarters with respect to certain products our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products this could increase costs or delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues and could negatively impact customer satisfaction 

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our and our customers’ proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our employees contractors customers suppliers and business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy the growing cyber risk environment means that individuals companies and organizations of all sizes including juniper have been and are increasingly subject to attacks and attempted intrusions including recent attempts on their and their vendors networks and systems by a wide range of actors including but not limited to nation states criminal enterprises and terrorist organizations on an ongoing and regular basis despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure has experienced breaches and may be subject or vulnerable in the future to breaches or attacks by computer programmers hackers or sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors or breaches due to employee error or wrongful conduct malfeasance or other disruptions if any breach or attack compromises our networks or those of our vendors creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks or those of our customers 

suppliers or business partners could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost destroyed or stolen and we may be subject to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others including regulatory entities and suffer reputational and financial harm in addition hardware components and software including operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks or expose us or our products to cyber attacks or be exploited to gain unauthorized access to our or our customers’ systems or information we maintain this can be true even for “legacy” products that have been determined to have reached an end of life engineering status but will continue to operate for a limited amount of time furthermore third parties may attempt to exfiltrate data through the introduction into the information and communications technology supply chain of malicious products and components that are designed to defeat or circumvent encryption and other cybersecurity measures and if successful such actions could diminish customer trust in our products harm our business reputation and adversely affect our business and financial condition 

when vulnerabilities are discovered we evaluate the risk apply patches or take other remediation actions and notify customers business partners and suppliers as appropriate all of this requires significant resources and time and attention from management and our employees 

as a result of any actual or perceived breach of network security that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products and our overall reputation could be harmed as a large well known provider of networking products cyber attackers regularly and specifically target our products or attempt to imitate us or our products in order to compromise a network because the techniques used by attackers many of whom are highly sophisticated and wellfunded to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques or the vulnerabilities they have caused this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions which could have an adverse impact on our financial results the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the attacker which are often difficult to pinpoint additionally we could be subject to regulatory investigations potential fines and litigation in connection with a security breach or related issue and be liable to third parties for these types of breaches 

we rely on valueadded and other resellers as well as distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded and other reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm nippon telegraph and telephone corporation and nec corporation the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products and some of which sell their own competing products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets fail to expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively determine that we cannot continue to do business with these partners for any reason or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues at the time we sell products to our distributors if these sales are made based on inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted further our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand 

we are also vulnerable to third parties who illegally distribute or sell counterfeit stolen or unfit versions of our products which has happened in the past and could happen in the future such sales could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and scale and improve our processes and procedures that support the channel as a result our programs processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage we have previously entered into oem agreements 

with partners pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the programs processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products we also depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

some of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and the interfaces between the two for example on december 31 2018 we entered into a master services agreement and certain statements of work with ibm pursuant to which we have outsourced significant portions of our it and other administrative functions these cloud providers third party providers and offsite facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption including performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures equipment failure adverse events caused by operator error cybersecurity attacks and similar events in addition because we lease offsite data center facilities we cannot be assured that we will be able to expand our data center infrastructure to meet user demand in a timely manner or on favorable economic terms if we have issues receiving and processing data this may delay our ability to provide products and services to our customers and business partners and damage our business we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with any of the third parties we rely on for our it systems could result in liabilities to our customers and business partners lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business for example we acquired mist systems in 2019 htbase in 2018 and cyphort in 2017 acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs liabilities litigation and diversion of managements attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology and the potential loss of key employees customers distributors vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire or that the transaction will advance our business strategy the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage operate or integrate any acquired business or if we are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization including through the use of common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices we could be required to writedown investments and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders use a substantial portion of our cash resources assume liabilities both known and unknown record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to lawsuits investigations proceedings and other disputes which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay fines or damages undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors have been and may become subject to various lawsuits we have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters commercial transactions 

and patent infringement as well as securities laws in addition certain us governmental agencies previously conducted investigations into possible violations by the company of the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa which ultimately resulted in the company entering into a settlement with the sec that involved the company making a payment of 118 million in august 2019 

generally we cannot predict the duration scope outcome or consequences of litigation and government investigations in connection with any limitation or government investigations we may agree to settle the matter we may be required to pay damages and incur other remedies which may be material and we may suffer reputational harm in addition if we fail to comply with the terms of any settlement agreement we could face more substantial penalties the lawsuits and investigations are expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights resolution of which may be timeconsuming and expensive as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights in addition increased patent litigation brought by nonpracticing entities in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in our customers requesting or requiring us to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies enter into license agreements or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us or anyone we are required to indemnify by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money if we fail to develop noninfringing technology if we incorporate infringing technology in our products or if we license required proprietary rights at material expense our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

as we seek to sell more products directly to telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies and other large customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or impact the amount of revenues to be recognized 

telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies which comprise a significant portion of our customer base and other large companies generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and accordingly often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers as we seek to sell more products directly to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

in addition these types of customers have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may impact the amount of revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased patent litigation brought against customers in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in customers requesting or requiring vendors to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulation of our industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects 

we are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas for example some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet countryspecific safety conformance or security certification criteria or incountry test requirements other regulations that may negatively impact our business include local content or local manufacturing requirements most commonly applicable for government stateowned enterprise or regulated industry procurements these types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements applicable to public companies regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries which we refer to collectively as the drc and procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals” these minerals are present in our products in addition the european union reached agreement in late 2016 on an euwide conflict minerals rule under which most eu importers of tin tungsten tantalum gold and their ores will have to conduct due diligence to ensure the minerals do not originate from conflict zones and do not fund armed conflicts large manufacturers also will have to disclose how they plan to monitor their sources to comply with the rules the regulation was adopted in 2017 with compliance required by 2021 

in addition environmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment may adversely impact our business and financial condition these laws and regulations include among others the european union or eu restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances directive or rohs the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in electronic equipment including our products currently our products comply with the eu rohs requirements however certain exemptions are scheduled to lapse the lapse of any exemption further changes to this or other laws or passage of similar laws in the eu or other jurisdictions would require us to cease selling noncompliant products and to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us disrupt our operations or logistics and result in an adverse impact on our operating results in addition in validating the compliance of our products with applicable hazardous materials restrictions we rely substantially on affirmations by our component suppliers as to the compliance of their products with respect to those same restrictions failure by our component suppliers to furnish accurate and timely information could subject us to penalties or liability for violation of such hazardous materials restrictions interrupt our supply of products to the eu and result in our customers refusing or being unable to purchase our products additionally the eu and a number of other jurisdictions have adopted regulations requiring producers of electrical and electronic equipment to assume certain responsibilities for collecting treating recycling and disposing of products when they have reached the end of their useful life finally the eu reach regulations regulate the handling of certain chemical substances that may be used in our products 

in addition as a contractor and subcontractor to us government departments and agencies we are subject to federal regulations pertaining to our it systems for instance as a subcontractor to the us department of defense or dod the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement or dfars required that our it systems comply with the security and privacy controls described in national institute of standards and technology special publication 800171 or nist sp 800171 the dfars also requires that we flow the security control requirement down to certain of our own subcontractors failure to comply with these requirements could result in a loss of federal government business subject us to claims or other remedies for noncompliance and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the internet telecommunications industry similarly while there are currently few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the internet and internet service provider access charges we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service providers or cloud provider companies regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers needs for products for instance in december 2017 the us federal communications commission repealed its 2015 regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks this change in regulatory treatment of networks might impact service provider and cloud provider business models and their need for internet telecommunications equipment and services at the same time several states have enacted their own laws and regulations governing certain aspects of fixed and wireless networks in the manner of the 2015 fcc regulations these laws and regulations enacted by the states are or will be subject to legal challenges from the federal government andor regulated providers 

also many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security supply chain integrity privacy and data protection any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment 

the adoption and implementation of additional regulations such as the internet of things iot security law sb327 which became enforceable in 2020 could reduce demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products result in product inventory writeoffs impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner require us to spend significant time and expense to comply and subject us to fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

governmental regulations and economic sanctions affecting the import or export of products generally or affecting products containing encryption capabilities in particular could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls and restrictions on the export of among other things certain telecommunications products and components particularly those that contain or use encryption technology most of our products contain or use encryption technology and consequently are subject to such controls requirements and restrictions certain governments like those of russia and china control importation and incountry use of encryption items and technology the scope nature and severity of such controls vary widely across different countries and may change frequently over time 

for several years us government officials have had concerns with the security of products and services from certain telecommunications and video providers based in china as a result congress has enacted bans on the use of the covered equipment and services in federal networks and even in the networks of subcontractors to the federal government 

in 2019 the us department of commerce or commerce department proposed a rule that would subject to government review the acquisition or use of information and communication technology or ict goods and services from entities owned by controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary the proposal would be retroactive and apply to transactions dating back to may 15 2019 if implemented as proposed the rule could subject acquisition of components modules other parts and any services to lengthy government review processes this would introduce significant uncertainty into our supply chain planning as we would not be certain which potential acquisitions the government would permit and which it would reject 

increasingly governments have begun using export and import controls not only to further national security objectives but also to protect local industries and restrict proliferation of locally developed “emerging or foundational technology for example in 2018 the us enacted the export control reform act which expands the power of the commerce department to use export controls to protect domestic industry and to restrict the export of emerging and foundational technologies not currently subject to controls in furtherance of that law on november 19 2018 the commerce department sought public comment on how to define emerging technologies our ability to market and sell our products overseas may be impacted by such export controls if and when they are imposed 

in addition the us and other governments have especially broad sanctions and embargoes prohibiting provision of goods or services to certain countries and territories and to certain sanctioned governments legal entities and individuals some of these restrictions have been imposed not just to protect national security but also to protect domestic industries and to achieve political aims for instance the commerce department in 2018 added to its entity list a chinese semiconductor manufacturer on the express basis that it threatens the viability of us competitors the entity list traditionally is used to restrict exports to end users that pose a security risk particularly far reaching and complex are restrictions imposed by the us and eu on exports to russia and in particular to the disputed region of crimea we have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into these restricted countries or to prohibited entities or individuals but there can be no assurance that our third party downstream resellers and distributors will abide by these restrictions or have processes in place to ensure compliance especially where local government regulation might prohibit adherence to such restrictions 

certain governments also impose special local content certification testing source code review escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys or other cybersecurity feature requirements to protect network equipment and software procured by or for the government similar requirements also may be imposed in procurements by state owned entities “soe’s” or even private companies forming part of “critical network infrastructure” or supporting sensitive industries for example china vietnam and india have promulgated cybersecurity regulations affecting networking products that may impair our ability to profitably market and sell our products there china in particular is expected to require implementation of nonstandard chinese encryption algorithms in products sold into certain government soe critical infrastructure and sensitive industry such as financial institutions markets in the us there are new restrictions on the use of certain chineseorigin components or systems either 1 in items sold to the us government or 2 in the internal networks of government contractors and subcontractors even if those 

networks are not used for governmentrelated projects the us government also might restrict or ban the use of certain chineseorigin components and systems in next generation mobile communications networks eg 5g 

in addition governments sometimes impose additional taxes on certain imported products for example the united states and chinese governments each have imposed tariffs on certain products originating from the other country in 2018 the united states imposed tariffs on a large variety of products of china origin as a result beginning september 24 2018 a large portion of juniper products manufactured in china became subject to a 10 tariff on importation into the us pursuant to the us government’s list 3 tariff proceeding the us president announced on may 5 2019 that the rate would increase to 25 on may 10 2019 due to the lack of negotiation progress on august 1 2019 the president stated his intent to increase the list 3 tariff to 30 which he announced would occur on october 15 2019 this planned increase to 30 has been postponed indefinitely similarly in july 2019 the us president reiterated his readiness to impose tariffs on all remaining chinese imports list 4 tariff proceeding if uschina negotiations remained unresolved in august 2019 he announced that he would impose a 15 tariff on list 4 imports effective september 1 2019 pursuant to a uschina trade deal signed in midjanuary the list 3 rate will remain at 25 but the list 4 rate will decrease from 15 to 75 effective february 14 2020 

depending upon their duration and implementation as well as our ability to mitigate their impact these tariffs could materially affect our business including in the form of increased cost of goods sold increased pricing for customers and reduced sales 

governmental regulation of encryption or ip networking technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or related economic sanctions could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues and operating results in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in harm to our reputation and ability to compete in international markets penalties costs seizure of assets including source code and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or governmentfunded projects 

our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a wide variety of provincial state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these privacy and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations further our legal and regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to unexpected changes including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations to issues rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties significantly compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development and offering of new products and services 

for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance than the eu laws that previously applied additionally california recently enacted legislation the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective january 1 2020 the ccpa requires among other things covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and allow such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information final regulations by the california attorney general are expected to be published later this year 

it remains unclear the extent or timing of any modifications that will be made to the ccpa or how such modifications will be interpreted the effects of the ccpa potentially are significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply we may also be subject to additional obligations relating to personal data by contract that industry standards apply to our practices further other states have also expanded their data protection laws additionally the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data in addition we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored within that country 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data or to protect personal data from unauthorized access use or other processing could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals fines damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business further evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the eu the us uk and elsewhere including the classification of ip addresses machine identification information location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting business relationships and partnerships that may involve the sharing or uses of data and may require significant costs resources and efforts in order to comply 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

our future success and ability to maintain a technology leadership position depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals with technological and creative skills in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas who have the expertise necessary to develop new products and develop enhancements for our current products and provide reliable product maintenance or sales people with specialized industry expertise is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

a number of our team members are foreign nationals who rely on visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the united states and other countries in recent years the united states has increased the level of scrutiny in granting h1b l1 and other business visas in addition the current us administration has made immigration reform a priority compliance with united states immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals any of these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets 

as of december 31 2019  our goodwill was 33371 million  and our purchased intangible assets were 1858 million we are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill annually or more frequently if certain circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible assets below their carrying values when the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset might not be recoverable a charge to operations is recorded either event would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred we have in the past recorded goodwill impairment charges declines in our level of revenues or declines in our operating margins or sustained declines in our stock price increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives may become impaired in future periods 

our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis such as expected future cash flows the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets and our stock price if the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets however any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by the following earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement costs related to intercompany restructuring tax effects of sharebased compensation challenges to our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof for example on november 12 2019 in altera corp v commissioner the ninth circuit court of appeals denied altera corporation’s petition for rehearing en banc of its case following the ninth circuit’s decision against altera issued on june 7 2019 the “2019 opinion” the 2019 opinion required related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement to share expenses related to sharebased compensation altera appealed this decision to the us supreme court on february 10 2020 pending final resolution of the altera case the company’s position on costsharing of sharebased compensation remains unchanged if the final judicial decision is not in favor of altera we expect our effective tax rate and current income tax payable to be higher we are monitoring this case and any impact the final resolution may have on our financial statements in addition the tax act made significant changes to the taxation of us business entities that may have a meaningful impact to our provision for income taxes these changes included a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate the current taxation of certain foreign earnings the imposition 

of baseerosion prevention measures which may limit the deduction of certain transfer pricing payments and possible limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or corporate debt obligations accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act required significant judgments and estimates that are based on current interpretations of the tax act the us department of the treasury continues to issue regulations that affect various components of the act our future effective tax rate may be impacted by changes in interpretation of the regulations as well as additional legislation and guidance regarding the act 

furthermore on october 5 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development or oecd an international association of 35 countries including the us published final proposals under its base erosion and profit shifting or beps action plan the beps action plan includes fifteen actions to address beps in a comprehensive manner and represents a significant change to the international corporate tax landscape these proposals as adopted by countries may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are generally subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service or irs and other tax authorities it is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes but the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made there can be no assurance that the outcomes from continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our ability to compete 

we generally rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology any of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings and other competitive harm 

in addition despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that the agreements we have entered into will not be breached we cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 

furthermore the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the united states in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic business regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the uks formal exit from the eu on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as brexit has caused and may continue to cause uncertainty in the global markets the uk is expected to enter a transition period until december 31 2020 permitting negotiation of a free trade deal between the us and uk the consequences for the economies of the uk and eu member states as a result of the uks withdrawal from the eu remain unknown and unpredictable any impact from brexit on the company will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade and other negotiations for example changes to the way service providers conduct business and transmit data between the uk and the eu could require us to make changes to the way we handle customer data we are also reviewing the impact of any resulting changes to eu or uk law that could affect our operations such as labor policies financial planning product manufacturing and product distribution political and regulatory responses to the withdrawal are still developing and we are in the process of assessing the impact the withdrawal may have on our business as more information becomes available including but not limited to changes to uk immigration policy that may affect our ability to attract and retain talent in emea nevertheless because we conduct business in the eu and the uk any of the effects of brexit including those we cannot anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our business business opportunities operating results financial condition and cash flows the lack of certainty given the pending euuk negotiations creates the risk that notwithstanding that we have devoted significant resources to preparing for the impact of brexit we may not be adequately prepared for an unforeseen outcome 

our business is also impacted by the negotiation and implementation of free trade agreements between the united states and other nations such agreements can reduce barriers to international trade and thus the cost of conducting business overseas for instance the united states reached a new trilateral trade agreement with the governments of canada and mexico to replace the north american free trade agreement nafta the united states and mexico have ratified the agreement with canada expected to follow suit in the coming months even after ratification the three nations must meet various obligations before the agreement takes effect 

many of the products that we have manufactured in china are transported by air cargo from hong kong recently there have been political demonstrations in hong kong that have resulted in cancellations or delays in flights in and out of china if these demonstrations and their impact on air shipments continue we could experience delays in product deliveries from china or be required to change our shipping practices which could adversely impact our business 

further the spread of covid19from china has affected the manufacturing and shipment of goods in january 2020 the chinese government imposed certain restrictions on movement of people and goods to limit the spread of covid19 in and around wuhan while our products are not manufactured in wuhan any delay in production or delivery of our products or components made by our suppliers due to an extended closure of our suppliers plants as a result of efforts to limit the spread of covid19 in china could adversely impact our business in addition several airlines have canceled flights to and from china affecting the ability to obtain components needed for manufacturing elsewhere the united states also imposed flights rules at the beginning of february that redirect flights carrying passengers who have visited china to one of seven us airports this applies even for flights not originating in china if any of our products are shipped as cargo on such flights they could be diverted to those airports 

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the united states or in other countries in which we operate in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors channel partners and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in termination of our relationship financial reporting problems fines andor penalties for us or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected defects errors or malware or do not meet customer quality expectations our business could be adversely affected and we may be subject to additional costs or lawsuits or be required to pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities these errors may arise from hardware or software we produce or procure from third parties some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers 

any errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in monetary penalties negative publicity loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and reputation penalties and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition in the event an error defect malware or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty or indemnification defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed moreover if our products fail to satisfy our customers quality expectations for whatever reason the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

because a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound chinese yuan euro and indian rupee related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars this could negatively affect our ability to meet our customers pricing expectations in those markets and may result in erosion of gross margin and market share a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows with the aim of offsetting the impact of currency fluctuations on these exposures however hedge activities can be costly and hedging cannot fully offset all risks including longterm declines or 

appreciation in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines or appreciation in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to effectively improve our systems and processes or we fail to monitor and ensure that these systems and processes are being used correctly our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or are not available on terms acceptable to us our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to renegotiate our current thirdparty licenses or license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the failure to comply with the terms of any license including free open source software may result in our inability to continue to use such license some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them in addition we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products third party technology we incorporate into our products that is deemed to infringe on the intellectual property of others may result and in some cases has resulted in limitations on our ability to source technology from those third parties restrictions on our ability to sell products that incorporate the infringing technology increased exposure to liability that we will be held responsible for incorporating the infringing technology in our products and increased costs involved in removing that technology from our products or developing substitute technology our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us if possible to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on the availability and performance of information technology services provided by third parties including ibm which will manage a significant portion of our systems 

under the terms of our recent master services agreement and certain statements of work ibm provides us with a broad range of information technology services such as applications including support development and maintenance infrastructure management and support including for servers storage and network devices and end user support including service desk our businesses are dependent on the services provided and systems operated for us by ibm and its thirdparty providers the failure of one or more of these entities to meet our performance standards and expectations including with respect to data security may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our success is dependent on our ability to maintain effective relationships with ibm and other thirdparty technology and service providers as well as the ability of ibm and any other thirdparty providers to perform as expected we may terminate our agreement 

with ibm and any and all statements of work at any time on short notice for cause convenience certain specific performance failures a breach of warranties by ibm failure to transform changes in law force majeure or a change in the control of either ibm or us depending on the type and timing of a termination we may be required to pay certain termination amounts to ibm ibms only right to terminate the master services agreement is based on our failure to comply with certain terms applying to disputed payments 

this arrangement is subject to various risks some of which are not within our control these risks include but are not limited to disruption in services and the failure to protect the security and integrity of our data under the terms of the agreement we are unable to provide assurances that some or all of these risks will not occur failure to effectively mitigate these risks if they occur could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition we could face significant additional costs or business disruption if our arrangement with ibm is terminated or impaired and we cannot find alternative it services or support on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis or if we are unable to hire new employees in order to return these services inhouse 

we are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and publicly disclose material weaknesses in our controls any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception and our stock price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness or significant deficiency investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major credit rating agencies routinely evaluate our indebtedness this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our debt obligations including the notes and the revolving credit facility 

as of december 31 2019  we had 17000 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes which we refer to collectively as the notes in april 2019 we entered into a new credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a fiveyear 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility which we refer to as the revolving credit facility with an option to increase the revolving credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million  subject to the lenders approval the credit agreement will terminate in april 2024 at which point all amounts borrowed must be repaid subject to two oneyear maturity extension options as of december 31 2019 no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon our ability to pay our expenses satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance which will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control based upon current levels of operations we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon however if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt we may be required to sell assets reduce capital expenditures refinance all or a portion of our existing debt including the notes or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the indenture that governs the notes contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

the credit agreement contains two financial covenants along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following 

 we are permitted to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 35x for up to four quarters and an interest coverage ratio no less than 30x 

 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business a failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness which could result in an event of default under our other debt instruments our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default in addition in the event of an acceleration we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments including those under the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon 

in addition certain changes under the tax act may result in limitations on the deductibility of our net business interest expenses the tax act generally limits the annual deduction for net business interest expense to an amount equal to 30 of adjusted taxable income as a result if our taxable income were to decline we may not be able to fully deduct our net interest expense these changes among others under the tax act could result in increases to our future us tax expenses which could have a material impact on our business 

a portion of the transaction consideration we received from the divestiture of our junos pulse product portfolio is in the form of a noncontingent seller promissory note and we may not receive the amount owed to us including accrued interest including in the time frame contemplated by the buyer under the note 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed the sale of our junos pulse product portfolio to an affiliate of siris capital a private equity firm for total consideration of 2307 million of which 1250 million was in the form of an 18month noncontingent interestbearing promissory note issued to the company on may 1 2017 we received a principal payment in the amount of 750 million and outstanding interest on the note and we and the issuer agreed to further amend the terms of the note with respect to the remaining approximately 580 million to among other things extend the maturity date from december 31 2018 to september 30 2022 provided that interest due can be paid in kind by increasing the outstanding principal amount of the note and subordinate the note to other debt issued by senior lenders since a portion of the transaction consideration is in the form of a noncontingent seller promissory note and the note is subordinated to debt issued by senior lenders there is the risk that we may not receive the amount owed to us including accrued interest including in the time frame contemplated under the note in the event that the promissory note is not repaid on the terms we contemplate any collection or restructuring efforts we undertake may be costly and require significant time and attention from our management and there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover the amounts owed to us in full 

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends or achieve our intended capital return policy will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital and debt service requirements use of cash for acquisitions and other factors any failure to pay or increase future dividends as announced or a reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

in january 2018 we announced that our board of directors approved a new 20 billion buyback authorization which replaced our prior authorization and in october 2019 the board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10 billion of common stock under the 2018 stock repurchase program any failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities and equity securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at december 31 2019  we had 12158 million in cash and cash equivalents and 13278 million in shortand longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in assetbacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities money market funds mutual funds time deposits us government agency securities and us government securities we also have 1898 million in other longterm assets for our investments in privatelyheld companies certain of our investments are subject to general credit liquidity market sovereign debt and interest rate risks our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate or libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our financial obligations and instruments including our credit facility pulse note supplier finance programs and floating rate notes that we have invested in as well as interest rate swaps that we use as fair value hedges of our fixedrate 2041 notes are or may be made at variable interest rates that use libor or metrics derived from or related to libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 these reforms may cause libor to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely these reforms may also result in new methods of calculating libor to be established or alternative reference rates to be established for example the federal reserve bank of new york has begun publishing a secured overnight funding rate or sofr which is intended to replace us dollar libor and central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies the potential consequences of these actions cannot be fully predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows in addition any transition process may involve among other things increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that rely on libor reductions in the value of certain instruments or the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges increased borrowing costs uncertainty under applicable documentation or difficult and costly consent processes this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction the us district court for the district of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law our restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws iv any action or proceeding asserting a claim as to which delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction on the court of chancery or v any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could have a material and adverse impact on our business 

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis in addition our insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our stock price may fluctuate 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products liabilities or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies from time to time economic weakness has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have also reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future

the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap in the course of operating our business we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices the collection of receivables the manufacturing and shipment of products the fulfillment of orders the purchase of supplies and the building of inventory and spare parts among other matters in making these decisions we consider various factors including contractual obligations customer satisfaction competition internal and external financial targets and expectations and financial planning objectives each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period for further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates see “critical accounting policies and estimates” section included in this “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer liabilities assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our significant accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

 

goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recorded we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of november 1 st  or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment then the reporting units carrying value is compared to its fair value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value we perform 

the second step of the impairment test goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches the discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results the market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill of our reporting units 

we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018 as of december 31 2019 we determined that no impairment of the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units was required see note 7 goodwill and purchased intangible assets in notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

 

we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  our contract manufacturer liabilities were 286 million and 304 million  respectively 

significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory and obsolete material exposures we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and contract manufacturer liabilities which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 

 

our estimates of ssp for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels gross margin objectives internal costs competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles our estimates for rights of return rebates and price protection are based on historical sales returns and price protection credits specific criteria outlined in customer contracts or rebate agreements and other factors known at the time our estimates for expected penalties and other price concessions are based on historical trends and expectations regarding future incurrence 

changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 



that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the research and development or rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules in addition the oecd’s recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles as adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

results of operations 

a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 is presented below a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year ended december 31 2018 compared to 2017 can be found under item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 filed with the sec on february 22 2019 which is available on the sec’s website at wwwsecgov and our investor relations website at httpinvestorjunipernet 

revenues 

the following table presents net revenues by product and service customer vertical and geographic region in millions except percentages 



product net revenues decreased primarily due to lower routing revenues from our service provider vertical and to a lesser extent cloud partially offset by growth in enterprise 

routing revenue decreased primarily driven by service provider and cloud verticals from lower net revenues in our mx product family partially offset by growth in our ptx product family as a result of the mx to ptx transition primarily from our cloud vertical 

switching revenue decreased primarily driven by service provider and to a lesser extent enterprise partially offset by cloud the decrease was a result of lower net revenues from our qfx and ex product families 

security revenue increased primarily driven by service provider and to a lesser extent enterprise partially offset by cloud the yearoveryear growth was primarily driven by the growth in midrange srx 

service net revenues increased primarily due to strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts 

customer 

no customer accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during the years ended december 31 2019  and 2018  

gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



our gross margins as a percentage of net revenues have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the mix and average selling prices of our products and services new product introductions and enhancements manufacturing component and logistics costs expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations cost of support and service personnel customer mix as we continue to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers the mix of distribution channels through which our products and services are sold and import tariffs for example the united states imposed a tariff on networking products imported from china which includes certain products that we import into and sell within the united states for more information on the potential impact of tariffs on our business see the “risk factors” section of item 1a of part i of this report  

product gross margin 

product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased primarily due to higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of mist customer and product mix and to a lesser extent china tariffs partially offset by improvements in our cost structure we continue to undertake specific efforts to address certain factors impacting our product gross margin these efforts include performance and quality improvements through engineering to increase value across our products optimizing our supply chain and service business pricing management and increasing software and solution sales 

service gross margin 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs 

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expenses in millions except percentages 



our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnelrelated costs including salaries and wages commissions and bonuses which we refer to collectively as variable compensation benefits sharebased compensation and travel facility and information technology or it departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount we had a total of 9419 and 9283 employees as of december 31 2019  and 2018  respectively our headcount increased by 136 employees or 1 primarily due to the acquisition of mist and from hiring for our sales transformation efforts earlier this year our headcount increase was partially offset by our restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2019 designed to realign our workforce with our sales strategy improve productivity and enhance cost efficiencies which we refer to as the 2019 restructuring plan during the second quarter of 2019 we amended the 2019 restructuring plan and undertook certain further actions that resulted in additional severance additional facility consolidation and contract termination costs 

research and development 

research and development expense or rd decreased 475 million primarily due to lower personnelrelated costs including a decrease in sharebased compensation expense of 269 million mainly driven by lower expense from certain performance share awards or psas where vesting is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones the decrease was also driven by lower facilities expense of 115 million due to a facility closure during the third quarter of 2018 the decrease was partially offset by higher engineering costs of 73 million due to increased investments in certain rd projects 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased 119 million primarily due to higher outside service costs of 76 million related to consulting projects higher sharebased compensation of 48 million primarily from the acquisition of mist during 2019 and from higher facilities expense of 48 million the increase was partially offset by lower personnelrelated costs of 162 million from restructuring actions in the first half of the year 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased 132 million primarily from costs related to the acquisition of mist systems of 166 million and from higher sharebased compensation of 83 million in 2018 we established an accrual of 120 million for the fcpa matter with the sec which was subsequently settled in 2019 for 118 million 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges increased 280 million primarily due to additional severance costs related to workforce reductions and contract termination costs recorded under the 2019 restructuring plan 

other expense net 

the following table presents other expense net in millions except percentages 



 

nm  percentage is not meaningful 

interest income primarily includes interest earned on our cash cash equivalents investments and a promissory note issued to us in connection with the sale of junos pulse interest expense primarily includes interest net of capitalized interest expense from longterm debt and customer financing arrangements loss on extinguishment of debt resulted from the early repayment of senior notes due 2020 and 2021 loss on investments net primarily includes losses from the sale of investments in public and privatelyheld companies and any observable changes in fair value and impairment charges recorded on these investments other typically consists of foreign exchange gains and losses and other nonoperational income and expense items 

interest income 

interest income increased 64 million primarily due to higher interest income related to our fixed income investment portfolio as a result of higher yields 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 145 million primarily due to a reduction in total debt primarily from the repayment in february 2019 of our 3125 senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of 3500 million and from the repayment in august 2019 of our 3300 and 4600 senior notes due in 2020 and 2021 respectively for an aggregate principal amount of 6000 million the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by the issuance of our 375 senior notes due 2029 for an aggregate principal amount of 5000 million in august 2019 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

during the year ended december 31 2019  we incurred a call premium related to the early repayment of our 2020 and 2021 senior notes conversely there were no such charges recorded in 2018  

loss on investments net 

during the year ended december 31 2019  our loss on investments decreased primarily related to certain equity investments in privatelyheld companies 

income tax provision benefit 

the following table presents the income tax provision benefit in millions except percentages 



the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was higher than 2018 primarily due to the net difference in discrete items unique to fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 in 2019 our effective rate included a 254 million benefit including interest related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits pursuant to the resolution of a tax audit and a 75 million benefit including interest for a lapse in statute of limitations the 2018 rate reflected a 676 million benefit including interest related to a lapse in statute of limitations a 332 million benefit as a result of filing a change in tax accounting method for the recognition of deferred product revenue and a 322 million benefit resulting from a tax accounting method change related to foreign deferred service revenue 

for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 and further explanation of our income tax provision see note 14 income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

on june 7 2019 the ninth circuit court of appeals or the court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement to share expenses related to sharebased compensation altera appealed this decision to the us supreme court on february 10 2020 pending final resolution of the altera case the company’s position on costsharing of sharebased compensation remains unchanged we will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential financial statement impacts if a judicial decision against altera had been finalized in the reporting period our effective tax rate for 2019 would have been higher 

our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates our effective tax rate may also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items see item 1a of part i risk factors of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results 

as a result of recommendations by the oecd on base erosion and profit shifting certain countries in emea and apac have either enacted new corporate tax legislation or are considering enacting such legislation in the near future we expect the effect of these reform measures to potentially impact longstanding tax principles particularly in regards to transfer pricing consequently we expect global tax authorities to increasingly challenge our cost sharing and other intercompany arrangements and the related sourcing of taxable profits in global jurisdictions 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital return strategy including our stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and the issuance of our longterm debt the following table presents our capital resources in millions except percentages 



summary of cash flows 

the following table summarizes cash flow activity from our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions except percentages 



operating activities 

our primary source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnelrelated expenditures payments for suppliers and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

net cash provided by operations decreased primarily due to lower revenues and lower collections partially offset by lower cash payments for income taxes and to suppliers 

investing activities 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures purchases sales maturities and redemptions of investments and cash used for business combinations 

net cash used in investing activities was 5282 million in 2019 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 5648 million in 2018 in 2019 the payment for the acquisition of mist was 2709 million and net purchases of investments was 1404 million  in 2018 net proceeds from sales maturities and redemptions of investments was 7713 million primarily to fund the stock repurchases discussed below 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock payment of cash dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans 

net cash used in financing activities increased in 2019  compared to 2018  the 2019 payments were primarily comprised of 4548 million net repayments of debt payments of 5500 million under the 2018 stock repurchase program and 2601 million payments of dividends the 2018 payments were primarily comprised of 7500 million under the 2018 stock repurchase program and 2493 million payments of dividends 

capital return 

the following table summarizes our dividends paid and stock repurchase activities in millions except per share amounts 



 

 

in january 2018 our board of directors which we refer to as the board approved a 20 billion share repurchase program which we refer to as the 2018 stock repurchase program in october 2019 the board authorized a 10 billion increase to the 2018 stock repurchase program for a total of 30 billion  

as part of the 2018 stock repurchase program in february 2018 and april 2019 we entered into two accelerated share repurchase programs the asr and repurchased 7500 million and 3000 million of our common stock respectively the aggregate number of shares ultimately repurchased of 293 million and 116 million shares of our common stock respectively was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price less an agreed upon discount of 2562 and 2579 per share respectively the shares we received were retired and accounted for as a reduction to stockholder’s equity in the consolidated balance sheets and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share 

as part of the 2018 stock repurchase program on october 28 2019 we entered into an additional asr with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of 2000 million of our outstanding common stock we made an upfront payment of 2000 million pursuant to the asr and received and retired an initial 64 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of 1600 million based on the market price of 2515 per share of our common stock on the date of the transaction the initial shares received by us were retired accounted for as a reduction to stockholder’s equity in the consolidated balance sheets and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share the forward contract for the remaining 400 million is considered indexed to our common stock and met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification 

during the first quarter of 2020 the asr was completed and we received an additional 18 million shares from the financial institution these 18 million shares will be retired in the first quarter of 2020 the completion of the asr resulted in a total settlement of 82 million shares of our common stock at a volume weighted average repurchase price less an agreed upon discount of 2444 per share 

during the fiscal year ended december 31 2019  we also repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of 500 million at an average price of 2363 per share under the 2018 stock repurchase program 

as of december 31 2019  there was 17 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 stock repurchase program 

future share repurchases under the 2018 stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements our 2018 stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time see note 11 equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our share purchase program 

in addition any future dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates are subject to approval by the board or an authorized committee thereof see note 18 subsequent event  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for discussion of our dividend declaration subsequent to december 31 2019  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however in the normal course of business we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and insurance programs see guarantees below for additional information regarding our guarantees 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments debt and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 



 

 

as of december 31 2019  we had 1274 million included in longterm income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes as a result this amount is not included in the table above 

revolving credit facility 

we had an unsecured revolving credit facility that was due to expire in june 2019 the “prior revolving credit facility” which enabled borrowings of up to 5000 million with the option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million subject to the lenders approval in april 2019 we entered into a new credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a fiveyear 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” with an option to increase the revolving credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million  subject to the lenders approval the prior revolving credit facility was terminated concurrently with our entering into the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility will terminate in april 2024 subject to two oneyear maturity extension options on the terms and conditions as set forth in the credit agreement the “credit agreement” as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement and no amounts were outstanding 

guarantees 

we have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and insurance programs of 306 million and 231 million  as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions investments in strategic relationships repurchases of additional shares of our common stock and payment of cash dividends on our common stock since the enactment of the tax act we have repatriated a significant amount of cash cash equivalents and investments from outside of the us and plan to continue to repatriate on an ongoing basis we intend to use the repatriated cash to invest in the business support valueenhancing merger and acquisitions or ma and fund our return of capital to stockholders 

in august 2019 we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec enabling us to offer for sale from time to time an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions any offerings of securities under our automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus in addition our revolving credit facility will also provide additional flexibility for future liquidity needs 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations planned stock repurchases and dividends capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including but not limited to our growth rate the timing and amount we spend to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services the costs to acquire or invest in businesses and technologies an increase in manufacturing or component costs and the risks and uncertainties detailed in the “risk factors” section of item 1a of part i of this report 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  

interest expense risk  availableforsale fixed income securities 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are in order of priority to preserve principal maintain liquidity and maximize yield the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility to minimize this risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities which includes assetbacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities money market funds mutual funds time deposits us government agency securities and us government securities at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our availableforsale fixed income securities held as of december 31 2019 and 2018 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points or bps 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate in millions 





foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies these foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately one to four months  

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound chinese yuan euro and the indian rupee approximately 79 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of twentyfour months or less the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was a reduction to operating expenses of 09 and 01 for years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  respectively see note 6 derivative instruments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our derivative and hedging activity 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december 31 2019 and as of december 31 2018  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of nonus dollar cash cash equivalents and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10 movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  respectively the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change 

the amount of cash cash equivalents and investments we would report in us dollars as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 by less than 15 and by less than 11 respectively 

equity price risk 

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies depending on the nature of these investments some can be carried at cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer less impairment and others can be carried at fair value the carrying values of our investments in privatelyheld companies were 1898 million and 904 million as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  respectively the privatelyheld companies in which we invest can still be considered to be in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privatelyheld companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

enterprises are consuming more valueasaservice where value is delivered in the form of cloudbased software and services we have introduced cloud management and security products which enable enterprises to consume cloud infrastructure and services securely we believe the transition to saas presents an opportunity for juniper to come to market with innovative network and security solutions for our enterprise customers which facilitate their transition to cloud architectures 

we believe our understanding of high performance networking technology and cloud architecture and our strategy position us to capitalize on the industry transition to more automated costefficient scalable networks 

customer verticals 

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales distributors valueadded resellers or vars and original equipment manufacturers or oems to endusers in the following verticals cloud service provider and enterprise in 2018 we revised the naming convention of our key customer verticals as follows and a summary of the types of customers included in our verticals is discussed below 

 

further we believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our key customers by

the following is an overview of the trends affecting the market in which we operate by each of our customer verticals we believe the networking needs for each of our customers will eventually result in cloudbased network architectures for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency 

cloud 

our cloud vertical includes companies that are heavily reliant on the cloud for their business model’s success customers in the cloud vertical can include cloud service providers such as the largest public cloud providers which we refer to as hyperscalers and tier2 cloud providers as well as enterprises that provide saas infrastructureasaservice or platformasaservice 

cloud providers continue to grow as more organizations take advantage of public infrastructure to run their business as their businesses grow we expect they will continue to invest in their networks which dictates the quality and experience of the products and the services they deliver to their endcustomers further as cloud providers begin to early adopt new network technologies such as the transition to 400gig ethernet this will present further opportunities for juniper across our portfolio as our cloud customers value highperformance highly compact power efficient infrastructures which we support and continue to develop 

in addition saas continues to be an important factor for cloud providers as their customers such as enterprises prefer to consume and procure product and service offerings via saas models as a result we believe that saas providers will invest in high performance infrastructure because the quality of experience has proven just as important competitively as software features and functions lastly as a result of new regulations and the need for lower latency and highperformance networking cloud providers are transitioning to regional network buildouts or distributed cloud environments to address the increasing demand for services data privacy data protection and consumer rights 

as cloud customers are pushing the envelope in networking our focus on collaboration combined with networking innovation around automation has made us a strategic partner with these customers helping them develop highperformance and lower total cost of ownership networking solutions to support their business 

service provider 

our service provider vertical includes wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators and we support most of the major carrier and operator networks in the world with our high performance network infrastructure offerings in recent years we have seen increased convergence of these different types of customers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships 

service provider customers recognize the need for highperformance networks and leveraging the cloud to reduce costs from their network operations this is dictating a change in business models and their underlying infrastructure which we believe requires investment in the buildout of highperformance networks and the transformation of existing legacy infrastructure to distributed cloud environments in order to satisfy the growth in mobile traffic and video as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including smartphones tablets and connected devices of various kinds 

we expect that network function virtualization or nfv and softwaredefined networking or sdn will be critical elements to enable our service provider customers the flexibility to support enhanced mobile video and dynamic new service deployments we are engaging with these customers to transition their operations to essentially nextgeneration cloud operations as the need for a highly efficient infrastructure to handle large amounts of data along with low latency or minimal delay plays into the need to have a high performance scalable infrastructure in combination with the automation and flexibility required to drive down operational costs and rapidly provision applications we consistently deliver leading technologies that transform the economics and experience of networkingsignificantly improving customer economics by lowering the capital expenditures required to build networks and the operating expenses required to manage and maintain them 

in addition to reducing operating costs service providers are seeking to create new or additional revenue opportunities to support their evolving business models these customers are preparing for 5g which we expect to begin to occur over the next few years and iot which we believe will give rise to new services like connected cars smart cities robotic manufacturing and agricultural transformation 5g and iot will require a highly distributed cloud data center architecture from which services are delivered to the end users and will involve a great degree of analytics and embedded security we expect this trend will present further 

 5 

opportunities for juniper with our focus on delivering a strong portfolio of network virtualization and softwarebased orchestration solutions which position us to deliver on the automation and agility requirements needs of service providers 

enterprise 

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the worlds most demanding enterprises we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers as well as branch and campus applications our enterprise vertical includes enterprises not included in the cloud vertical in particular they are industries with high performance high agility requirements including financial services national federal state and local governments as well as research and educational institutions we believe that our enterprise customers are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications 

we believe that as our enterprise customers continue to transition their workloads to the cloud they continue to seek greater flexibility in how they consume networking and security services such as payperuse models additionally enterprises are deploying multicloud architectures which require endtoend solutions for managing orchestrating and securing distributed cloud resources as a single pool of resources also we are increasingly seeing a convergence of networking and security resulting in security becoming an embedded capability in each and every solution that we offer to our customers 

highperformance enterprises require ip networks that are global distributed and always available we are innovating in key technology areas to meet the needs of our enterprise customers whether they plan to move to a public cloud architecture or hybrid cloud architecture which is a mix of public and private cloud as well as a growing number of saas applications in 2018  2017  and 2016  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues 

products services and technology 

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of telecom and cable operators as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for servicerich platforms at the edge of the network was created 

we have expanded our portfolio to address multiple domains in the network core edge access and aggregation data centers and campus and branch we have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon systems and software including our junos os and virtual network functions or vnf such as firewall network orchestration and automation to provide a range of hardware and software solutions in highperformance secure networking 

further our intent is to expand our software business by introducing new software solutions to our product portfolio that simplify the operation of networks and allow our customers across our key verticals flexibility in consumption and deployment our software offerings include subscription arrangements and perpetual licenses we believe our software revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase over time as we introduce new software product offerings and business models designed to better monetize the value of our software offerings 

we conduct business globally and are managed operated and organized by major functional departments that operate on a consolidated basis as a result we operate in one reportable segment the following is an overview of our principal product families and service offerings in 2018

services 

in addition to our products we offer maintenance and support professional and educational services we utilize a multitiered support model to deliver services that leverage the capabilities of our own direct resources channels partners and other thirdparty organizations 

 7 

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of support professional and educational services to ensure these services can be locally delivered 

as of december 31 2018  we employed 1818  people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we employ remote technical support engineers onsite resident engineers spare parts planning and logistics staff professional services consultants and educators with proven network experience to provide those services 

platform strategy   

in addition to our major product families and services our software portfolio has been a key technology element in our goal to be a leader in highperformance networking 

our junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers at the heart of the junos platform is junos os we believe junos os is fundamentally differentiated from other network operating systems not only in its design but also in its development capabilities the advantages of junos os include 

 

 

 

junos os is designed to improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades 

orchestration and monitoring 

as many of our customers are moving to a hybrid multicloud environment managing orchestrating and securing that complex environment can be a challenge we are committed to providing solutions to simplify networking operations to help our customers to optimize their infrastructure and workload placement across their hybrid multicloud environment with the following offerings

significant product development projects and solutions 

in 2018 we continued to execute on our product and solutions strategy and announced several new innovations that we expect to bring to market over the next few quarters including the industrys first 400gig optimized routing platform a new highperformance mx series 5g universal routing platform with new programmable silicon and our multicloud orchestration and telemetry platform including contrail edge cloud and contrail enterprise multicloud each of which we believe will help strengthen our position across our core markets 

we also announced new initiatives under an existing partnership with nutanix which we expect will help strengthen our ability to capitalize on multicloud with our contrail enterprise multicloud integration with nutanix’s application programming interface or apis providing enhanced network visibility further we entered into a new partnership with ericsson to accelerate 5g initiatives by leveraging each company’s complementary portfolios to drive our competitive advantage in the marketplace 

research and development 

we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols software applications and platforms and embedded operating systems as of december 31 2018  we employed 3692 people in our worldwide rd organization 

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications integrating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings in our products we are leveraging our software asic and systems technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers applications and continuing to develop technology to support the buildout of secure highperformance networks and cloud environments we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

our rd process is driven by our corporate strategy and the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our rd team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market 

sales and marketing 

as of december 31 2018  we employed 2425 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals business development teams systems engineers marketing teams channel teams and an operational infrastructure team are generally distributed between vertical markets within each team sales team members serve the following three geographic regions i americas including united states canada mexico caribbean and central and south america ii emea and iii apac within each region there are regional and country teams as well as vertical market focused teams to ensure we operate close to our customers 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships as described below 

we sell to a number of cloud and service provider customers directly otherwise we sell to all of our key customer verticals primarily through distributors and resellers 

in 2019 we transitioned our sales organization to better align our sales strategy to each of our customer verticals we believe the alignment of our sales leadership and product management teams across our customer verticals will position us for improved sales force productivity in late 2019 and position juniper to better capitalize on our end market opportunities in the longterm 

direct sales structure 

the terms and conditions of direct sales arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our order acknowledgment terms for those orders or by purchase contracts the direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

 9 

channel sales structure 

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales we utilize various channel partners including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

manufacturing and operations 

as of december 31 2018  we employed 340  people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who manage our supply chain including relationships with our contract manufacturers original design manufacturers component suppliers warehousing and logistics service providers 

our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in the united states or us china malaysia mexico and taiwan as of december 31 2018  we utilized celestica incorporated flextronics international ltd accton technology corporation and alpha networks inc for the majority of our manufacturing activity our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production including activities such as material procurement surface mount assembly final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to ensure that our products meet internal and external quality standards we believe that these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

 

 

 

our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to agreedupon specifications products are then shipped to our distributors vars or endusers generally we do not own the components title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the 

 10 

contract manufacturers or original design manufacturers location customers take title to the products upon delivery at a specified destination if the product or components remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period we may incur carrying charges or charges for excess or obsolete materials 

our contracts with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer as applicable may accept purchase orders from us these contracts do not represent longterm commitments 

we also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical components the majority of this inventory is production components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand 

some of our custom components such as asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs to ensure the security and integrity of juniper products during manufacture assembly and distribution we have implemented a supply chain risk management framework as part of our overall brand integrity management system this framework encompasses all aspects of the supply chain as well as enhanced elements specific to security issues applicable to juniper products and our customers 

by working collaboratively with our suppliers we endeavor to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and throughout our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted a business partner code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers our business partner code of conduct expresses support for and is aligned with the ten principles of the united nations global compact and the responsible business alliance code of conduct the responsible business alliance a coalition of electronics retail auto and toy companies provides guidelines and resources to drive performance and compliance with critical corporate social responsibility policies its goals are to promote ethical business practices to ensure that working conditions in the electronic industry supply chain are safe that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible by using standard audit and assessment protocols and tools we measure and monitor manufacturing partners’ and direct material suppliers’ compliance to the codes of conduct including but not limited to onsite audits risk assessments cdp climate change and water requests and conflict minerals surveys cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies can report their environmental performance on climate change and water and forest programs to institutional investors and customers our corporate citizenship and sustainability report and business partner code of conduct are available on our website 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements either with our distributors resellers or endcustomers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  our total product backlog was approximately 3443 million  and 4007 million   respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to our distributors resellers or endcustomers generally within the next six months backlog excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts 

 

 

seasonality 

we as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns historically we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

 11 

competition 

we compete in the network infrastructure markets these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to solutions that combine high performance networking with cloud technologies in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc or cisco has historically been the dominant player however our principal competitors also include arista networks inc or arista dell inc or dell hewlett packard enterprise co or hpe huawei technologies co ltd or huawei and nokia corporation or nokia 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco nokia hpe and huawei among others have broader portfolios which enable them to bundle their networking products with other networking and information technology products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition marketing budgets and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

in addition there are a number of other competitors in the security network infrastructure space including palo alto networks inc or palo alto networks check point software technologies ltd or check point f5 networks inc or f5 networks and fortinet inc or fortinet among others who tend to be focused specifically on security solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line 

we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco nokia and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that aim to build products with greater capabilities to compete with our products further there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue which may increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios 

in addition to established competitors a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior and cost effective in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have and also from emerging companies that are developing new technologies although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies there can be no assurance that new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

environment 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment or weee directive directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment or rohs and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals or reach regulations adopted by the european union or eu and china to date compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however see the risk factor entitled regulation of our industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects in the section entitled risk factors  in item 1a of part i of this report for additional information concerning regulatory compliance 

juniper’s greatest impact on the environment is through our products and services juniper has an environmental program based on our new product introduction process that supports a circular economy model for environmental sustainability and focuses on energy efficiency materials innovation and recyclability we consider opportunities to minimize resource impacts and improve efficiencies over a product’s life cycle from the materials we use and a product’s energy footprint to packaging and endoflife or eol activities such as reuse refurbishment and recycling 

 12 

we are committed to the environment through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput of key elements in our highperformance network product offerings our products are independently tested by third parties for energy efficiency compliance as an example our mx10008 and mx10016 products redefine perslot economics enabling customers to do more with less while simplifying network design and reducing operating expenses by consuming 06w per gigabit of throughput additionally we have redesigned packaging in ways that optimizes costs while minimizing resource impacts 

we are also voluntarily participating in cdp climate change and water disclosures and encourage our direct material suppliers to do the same additionally we are a member of the responsible business alliance or rba and have adopted and promote the adoption by our suppliers of the practices of the rba code of conduct as discussed above in the section entitled manufacturing and operations  we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to execute on monitor and drive environmental improvements in our global operations and within our supply chain 

intellectual property   

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products and from time to time we need to renegotiate these licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018  we had over 3100  patents worldwide and numerous patent applications are pending patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

employees   

as of december 31 2018  we had 9283 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

investments in our securities involve significant risks even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered in the past significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors disclosed by us including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our business operating results and stock price 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

the factors that may cause our quarterly results to vary quarter by quarter and be unpredictable include but are not limited to 

 

for example we and many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending particularly in the first quarter in addition while we may have backlog orders for products that have not shipped we believe that our backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results for a number of reasons including project delays changes in project scope and the fact that our customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty furthermore market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products rebates and discounting increased component or logistics costs issues with product quality regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations such adjustments may be difficult or impossible to execute in the short or medium term 

as a result of the factors described above as well as other variables affecting our operating results we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be in the past our operating results have been below our guidance our longterm financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors and this may happen in the future in which case the price of our common stock may decline and has declined in the past such a decline could also occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance

we expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time 

we expect our product and service gross margins to vary both in the nearterm and in the longterm and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors some of which have occurred and may occur in the future including customer vertical product and geographic mix shifts an increase or decrease in our software sales or services we provide increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete changes in the actions of our competitors or their pricing strategies which may be difficult to predict and respond to modifications to our pricing strategy in order to gain footprint in certain markets or with certain customers currency fluctuations that impact our costs or the cost of our products and services to our customers increases in material labor logistics warranty costs or inventory carrying costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers issues with manufacturing or component availability quality or efficiencies increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inaccurately forecasting product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products and enhancements or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures for example in fiscal year 2018 our margins decreased as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to lower net revenues and product mix in fiscal year 2017 our margins decreased as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower product net revenues and product mix resulting from the yearoveryear decline in routing revenues our customers architectural shifts and higher costs of certain memory components in fiscal year 2016 our margins decreased compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to elevated pricing pressure and product mix failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

further while we will continue to remain diligent in our longterm financial objective to increase revenue and operating margins and manage our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue we expect that our margins will vary with our ability to achieve these goals we can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve all or any of the goals of these plans or meet our announced expectations in whole or in part or that our plans will have the intended effect of improving our margins on the expected timeline or at all 

a limited number of our customers comprise a material portion of our revenues and any changes in the way they purchase products and services from us could affect our business in addition there is an ongoing trend toward consolidation in the industry in which our customers and partners operate any decrease in revenues from our customers or partners could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

a material portion of our net revenues across each customer vertical depends on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners changes in the business requirements or focus vendor selection project prioritization financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior including product mix purchased or delays in deployment of our key customers could significantly decrease our sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in recent years there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example centurylink incs acquisition of level 3 communications inc vodafone india’s acquisition of idea cellular ltd and tmobile us incs proposed acquisition of sprint corp and that consolidation trend has continued certain telecommunications companies have also moved towards vertical consolidation through acquisitions of media and content companies such as verizon’s acquisition of yahoo att’s acquisition of time warner and comcasts acquisition of sky if our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay suspend or indefinitely reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or other direct or indirect unforeseen consequences could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or uncertainty customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses in addition economic instability or uncertainty as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world have and may continue to put pressure on economic conditions which has led and could lead to reduced demand for our products to delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects andor higher costs of production more generallyspeaking economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore instability in the global markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected expenditures which could 

 17 

lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the short and medium term uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions 

from time to time we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount acquiring companies and increasing our investment in rd sales and marketing and other parts of our business conversely in 2017 2018 and 2019 we initiated restructuring plans to realign our workforce as a result of organizational and leadership changes align our execution priorities increase operational efficiencies and to consolidate facilities which resulted in restructuring charges in each of these years some of our expenses related to such efforts are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions which are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competition is intense in the markets that we serve the routing and switching markets have historically been dominated by cisco with competition coming from other companies such as nokia corporation arista hpe and huawei in the security market we face intense competition from cisco and palo alto networks as well as companies such as check point f5 networks and fortinet further a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition by or of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do in addition some of our competitors have become more integrated including through consolidation and vertical integration and offer a broader range of products and services which could make their solutions more attractive to our customers many of our competitors sell networking products as bundled solutions with other it products such as compute and storage systems if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our partners and resellers generally sell or resell competing products on a nonexclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete which could also adversely affect our business 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

a customers decision to purchase certain of our products particularly new products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment 

 18 

can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times both of which may be exacerbated by the impact of global economic weakness may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

the timing of product orders andor our reliance on revenue from sales of certain software or subscriptions and professional support and maintenance services may cause us to recognize revenue in a different period than the one in which a transaction takes place 

due to the cost complexity and custom nature of configurations required by our customers we generally build our network equipment products as orders are received the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter remains unpredictable if orders for certain products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter 

in addition services revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue comprising 33  31  and 29  of total revenue in fiscal year 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively sales of new or renewal professional services support and maintenance contracts may decline andor fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services or those offered by our competitors and reductions in our endcustomers’ spending levels we recognize professional services support and maintenance revenue periodically over the term of the relevant service period 

the introduction of new software products and services is part of our intended strategy to expand our software business and certain software revenues may be recognized periodically over the term of the relevant use period or subscription period as a result certain software subscription and support and maintenance revenue we report each fiscal quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters consequently a decline in such new or renewed contracts in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of certain software products subscriptions or support and maintenance is not reflected in full in our operating results until future periods also it is difficult for us to rapidly increase such software or services revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from those software subscription and support and maintenance contracts must be recognized over the applicable period 

additionally we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and technology roadmap and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services to deploy our products in their networks and ip infrastructures as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the buildout of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when our customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the software and equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure for example in recent years our switching and routing results were adversely affected by spending delays from our largest cloud customers who we believe are in the process of implementing a networking architectural shift the duration of the delay is difficult to predict in part because each cloud customer will migrate their network architecture based on their own constraints such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 19 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products product enhancements and business strategies that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available or strategies are not executed in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements continuous pricing pressures and a constantly evolving industry we may not be able to anticipate future technological shifts market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet such technological shifts needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all for example the move from traditional wide area network or wan infrastructures towards softwaredefined wan or sdwan has been receiving considerable attention in our view it will take several years to see the full impact of sdwan and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine hardware and software elements if we fail to anticipate market requirements or opportunities or fail to develop and introduce new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we invest time energy and resources in developing products for a market that doesnt develop it could likewise significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products enhancements or business strategies there can be no assurance that new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

in recent years we have announced a number of new products and enhancements to our hardware and software products across routing switching and security the success of our new products depends on several factors including but not limited to component costs timely completion and introduction of these products prompt resolution of any defects or bugs in these products our ability to support these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

the introduction of new software products is part of our intended strategy to expand our software business we have also begun to disaggregate certain software from certain hardware products such that customers would be able to purchase or license our hardware and software products independently which we expect could in time enable our hardware to be deployed with third party networking applications and services and our software to be used with thirdparty hardware the success of our strategy to expand our software business including our strategy to disaggregate software from certain hardware products is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

 

  and changes in tax treatment associated with software sales 

 

 

 

if any of our new products or business strategies do not gain market acceptance or meet our expectations for growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected and our competitive position and our business and financial results could be harmed 

 20 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to or disruptions in those relationships or manufacturing processes expected or unexpected may result in delays that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships which could include failing to provide accurate forecasts of our requirements or if one or more of them experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future an increase in the expected time required to manufacture our products or ship products such delays could result in supply shortfalls that damage our ability to meet customer demand for those products and could cause our customers to purchase alternative products from our competitors also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers or the introduction of new products by us would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover a significant portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other foreign countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states including import tariffs or regional conflicts for example the united states recently imposed a tariff on networking products imported from china this includes certain products that we import into and sell within the united states if we cannot mitigate the impact of the tariffs the increased cost could translate into higher prices for our customers reduced customer demand or increased cost of goods sold in addition increased costs of production or delays in production caused by any relocation of contract manufacturing facilities could impact the global competitiveness of our products each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers including for key components which makes us susceptible to shortages quality issues or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

we rely on single or limited sources for many of our components during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited for example we have recently experienced industrywide supply constraints related to power management components in addition some components used in our networking solutions have in the past and may in the future experience extended lead times and higher pricing given the demand in the market any future spike in growth in our business the use of certain components we share in common with other companies in it spending or the economy in general is likely to create greater shortterm pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories if shortages or delays persist we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build and deliver products in a timely manner and our revenues gross margins and customer relationships could suffer additionally if certain components that we receive from our suppliers have defects or other quality issues we may have to replace or repair such components and we could be subject to claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims we have experienced and from timetotime may experience component shortages or quality issues that resulted or could result in delays of product shipments revenue charges that impact our gross margins andor warranty or other claims or costs we also currently purchase numerous key components including asics and other semiconductor chips from single or limited sources and many of our component suppliers are concentrated in china and korea in addition there has been consolidation among certain suppliers of our components for example globalfoundries acquired ibm’s semiconductor manufacturing business avago technologies limited acquired broadcom corporation and intel corporation acquired altera corporation consolidation among suppliers can result in the reduction of the number of independent suppliers of components available to us which could negatively impact our ability to access certain component parts or the prices we have to pay for such parts in addition our suppliers may determine not to continue a business relationship with us for other reasons that may be beyond our control any disruptions to our supply chain could decrease our sales earnings and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to increases in wages that drive up prices the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes on components labor stoppages transportation failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods thirdparty interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters civil unrest military conflicts geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services 

the development of alternate sources for components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules also longterm supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may further increase 

 21 

the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of components and products would adversely affect our business 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

we provide demand forecasts for our products to our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our original design or contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins for example in certain prior quarters our gross margins were reduced as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand in addition some optical modules we use are experiencing faster product transitions than our other products which increases the risk that we could have excess inventory of those modules conversely lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time given that our contract manufacturers are thirdparty manufacturers for numerous other companies if we underestimate our requirements as we have in certain prior quarters with respect to certain products our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products this could increase costs or delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues and could negatively impact customer satisfaction 

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our and our customers’ proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy the growing cyber risk environment means that individuals companies and organizations of all sizes including juniper have been and are increasingly subject to the threat of intrusions on their networks and systems by a wide range of actors including but not limited to nation states criminal enterprises and terrorist organizations on an ongoing and regular basis despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure has experienced breaches and may be vulnerable in the future to breach or attacks by computer programmers hackers or sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors or breached due to employee error or wrongful conduct malfeasance or other disruptions if any breach or attack compromises our networks creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost or stolen and we may be subject to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and suffer reputational and financial harm in addition hardware components and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks or expose us or our products to cyber attacks this can be true even for “legacy” products that have been determined to have reached an end of life engineering status but will continue to operate for a limited amount of time furthermore third parties may attempt to exfiltrate data through the introduction into the information and communications technology supply chain of malicious products and components that are designed to defeat or circumvent encryption and other cybersecurity measures and if successful such actions could diminish customer trust in our products harm our business reputation and adversely affect our business and financial condition 

when vulnerabilities are discovered we evaluate the risk apply patches or take other remediation actions as required and notify customers and suppliers when appropriate all of this requires significant time and attention from management and our employees 

as a result of any actual or perceived breach of network security that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products and our overall reputation could be harmed as a large well known provider of networking products cyber attackers may specifically target our products or attempt to imitate us or our products in order to compromise a network because the techniques used by attackers many of whom are highly sophisticated and wellfunded to access or sabotage networks change 

 22 

frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques or the vulnerabilities they have caused this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions which could have an adverse impact on our financial results the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the attacker which are often difficult to pinpoint additionally we could be subject to regulatory investigations potential fines and litigation in connection with a security breach or related issue and be liable to third parties for these types of breaches 

we rely on valueadded and other resellers as well as distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded and other reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm dimension data and nec corporation the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products and some of which sell their own competing products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets fail to expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively determine that we cannot continue to do business with these partners for any reason or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues at the time we sell products to our distributors if these sales are made based on inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted further our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand 

we are also vulnerable to third parties who illegally distribute or sell counterfeit stolen or unfit versions of our products which has happened in the past and could happen in the future such sales could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and scale and improve our processes and procedures that support the channel as a result our programs processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage we have previously entered into oem agreements with partners pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the programs processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products we also depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

some of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and the interfaces between the two for example we are in the process of further consolidating our onsite data centers to the cloud and to offsite facilities that are hosted and controlled by third parties in addition on december 31 2018 we entered into a master services agreement and certain statements of work with ibm pursuant to which we will outsource significant portions of our it and other administrative functions following a transition period these cloud providers third party providers and offsite facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures equipment failure adverse events caused by operator error cybersecurity attacks and similar events in addition because we lease our cloud storage space and offsite data center facilities we cannot be assured that we will be able to expand our data center infrastructure to meet user demand in a timely manner or on favorable economic terms if we have issues receiving and processing 

 23 

data this may delay our ability to provide products and services to our customers and damage our business we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with any of the third parties we rely on for our it systems could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business for example we acquired htbase in 2018 and cyphort in 2017 acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs liabilities litigation and diversion of managements attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners and the potential loss of key employees customers distributors vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage operate or integrate any acquired business or if we are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to issue common stock  or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders use a substantial portion of our cash resources assume liabilities both known and unknown record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to lawsuits investigations proceedings and other disputes which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay fines or damages undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors have been or are subject to various lawsuits we have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters commercial transactions and patent infringement as well as securities laws the us securities and exchange commission or the sec is conducting and the us department of justice or the doj was previously conducting investigations into possible violations by the company of the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa in a number of countries the companys audit committee with the assistance of independent advisors conducted a thorough internal review of possible violations of the fcpa and the company made improvements in its internal controls and carried out a number of disciplinary actions the company is continuing to fully cooperate with the sec’s ongoing investigation and based on the recent communications with the staff of the sec the company believes it is likely that the staff of the sec will seek to bring an enforcement action against the company the company believes it is probable that it could incur a loss and has established an estimated legal reserve of 120 million related to the ongoing sec investigation litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain we therefore cannot predict the duration scope outcome or consequences of litigation and government investigations in connection with any government investigations including those in which we are currently involved as described above if the government takes action against us or we agree to settle the matter we may be required to pay substantial fines and incur other sanctions which may be material and suffer reputational harm the lawsuits and investigations are expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

 24 

we are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights resolution of which may be timeconsuming and expensive as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights in addition increased patent litigation brought by nonpracticing entities in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in our customers requesting or requiring us to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies enter into license agreements or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us or anyone we are required to indemnify by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money if we fail to develop noninfringing technology if we incorporate infringing technology in our products or if we license required proprietary rights at material expense our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

as we seek to sell more products to telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies and other large customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or impact the amount of revenues to be recognized 

telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies which comprise a significant portion of our customer base and other large companies generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and accordingly often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers for example our customers france telecomorange and deutsche telekom ag have formed a company for the purpose of purchasing products from and negotiating more favorable contractual terms with suppliers as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

in addition service providers have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may impact the amount of revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased patent litigation brought against customers by nonpracticing entities in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in customers requesting or requiring vendors to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulation of our industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects 

we are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas for example some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet countryspecific safety conformance or security certification criteria or incountry test requirements other regulations that may negatively impact our business include local content or local manufacturing requirements most commonly applicable for government stateowned enterprise or regulated industry procurements these types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements applicable to public companies regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries which we refer to collectively as the drc and procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals” these minerals are present in our products in addition the european union reached agreement in late 2016 on a euwide conflict minerals rule under which most eu importers of tin tungsten tantalum gold and their ores will have to conduct due diligence to 

 25 

ensure the minerals do not originate from conflict zones and do not fund armed conflicts large manufacturers also will have to disclose how they plan to monitor their sources to comply with the rules the regulation was adopted in 2017 with compliance required by 2021 

in addition environmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment may adversely impact our business and financial condition these laws and regulations include among others the european union or eu restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances directive or rohs the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in electronic equipment including our products currently our products comply with the eu rohs requirements however certain exemptions are scheduled to lapse the lapse of any exemption further changes to this or other laws or passage of similar laws in the eu or other jurisdictions would require us to cease selling noncompliant products and to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us disrupt our operations or logistics and result in an adverse impact on our operating results in addition in validating the compliance of our products with applicable hazardous materials restrictions we rely substantially on affirmations by our component suppliers as to the compliance of their products with respect to those same restrictions failure by our component suppliers to furnish accurate and timely information could subject us to penalties or liability for violation of such hazardous materials restrictions interrupt our supply of products to the eu and result in our customers refusing or being unable to purchase our products additionally the eu and a number of other jurisdictions have adopted regulations requiring producers of electrical and electronic equipment to assume certain responsibilities for collecting treating recycling and disposing of products when they have reached the end of their useful life finally the eu reach regulations regulate the handling of certain chemical substances that may be used in our products 

in addition as a contractor and subcontractor to us government departments and agencies we are subject to federal regulations pertaining to our it systems for instance as a subcontractor to the us department of defense or dod the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement or dfars required that our it systems comply with the security and privacy controls described in national institute of standards and technology special publication 800171 or nist sp 800171 the dfars also requires that we flow the security control requirement down to certain of our own subcontractors failure to comply with these requirements could result in a loss of federal government business subject us to claims or other remedies for noncompliance and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the internet telecommunications industry similarly while there are currently few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the internet and internet service provider access charges we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service providers or cloud provider companies regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers needs for products for instance in december 2017 the us federal communications commission repealed its 2015 regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks this change in regulatory treatment of networks might impact service provider and cloud provider business models and their need for internet telecommunications equipment and services at the same time several states have enacted their own laws and regulations governing certain aspects of fixed and wireless networks in the manner of the 2015 fcc regulations these laws and regulations enacted by the states are or will be subject to legal challenges from the federal government andor regulated providers also many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security supply chain integrity privacy and data protection any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment 

the adoption and implementation of additional regulations could reduce demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products result in product inventory writeoffs impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner require us to spend significant time and expense to comply and subject us to fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 26 

governmental regulations and economic sanctions affecting the import or export of products generally or affecting products containing encryption capabilities in particular could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls and restrictions on the export of among other things products that contain or use encryption technology most of our products contain or use encryption technology and consequently are subject to such controls requirements and restrictions certain governments like those of russia and china control importation and incountry use of encryption items and technology the scope nature and severity of such controls vary widely across different countries and may change frequently over time 

increasingly governments have begun using export and import controls not only to further national security objectives but also to protect local industries and restrict proliferation of locally developed “emerging or foundational technology for example in 2018 the us enacted the export control reform act which expands the power of the commerce department to use export controls to protect domestic industry and to restrict the export of emerging and foundational technologies not currently subject to controls in furtherance of that law on november 19 2018 the united states department of commerce sought public comment on how to define emerging technologies our ability to market and sell our products overseas may be impacted by such export controls 

certain governments also impose special local content certification testing source code review escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys or feature requirements on cybersecurity and other network equipment for purposes of government procurements similar requirements also may be imposed in procurements by state owned entities “soe’s” or even private companies forming part of “critical network infrastructure” or supporting sensitive industries for example china vietnam and india have promulgated cybersecurity regulations affecting networking products that may impair our ability to profitably market and sell our products there china in particular is expected to require implementation of nonstandard chinese encryption algorithms in products sold into certain government soe critical infrastructure and sensitive industry such as financial institutions markets in the us there are new restrictions on the use of certain chineseorigin components or systems in items sold to the us government 

in addition the us and other governments have especially broad sanctions and embargoes prohibiting provision of goods or services to certain countries and territories and to certain sanctioned governments legal entities and individuals some of these restrictions have been imposed not just to protect national security but also to protect domestic industries and to achieve political aims for instance the us department of commerce in 2018 added to its entity list a chinese semiconductor manufacturer on the express basis that it threatens the viability of us competitors the entity list traditionally is used to restrict exports to end users that pose a security risk particularly far reaching and complex are restrictions imposed by the us and eu on exports to russia and in particular to the disputed region of crimea we have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into these restricted countries or to prohibited entities or individuals but there can be no assurance that our third party downstream resellers and distributors will abide by these restrictions or have processes in place to ensure compliance especially where local government regulation might prohibit adherence to such restrictions 

in addition governments sometimes impose additional taxes on certain imported products for example the united states and chinese governments each have imposed tariffs on certain products originating from the other country in 2018 the united states for example imposed tariffs on a large variety of products of china origin as a result beginning september 24 2018 a large portion of juniper products manufactured in china became subject to a 10 tariff on importation into the us that tariff rate may increase to 25 on march 2 2019 absent satisfactory outcome of continuing negotiations between the united states and china the us president has also indicated a readiness to further expand the scope of the tariffs on chinese goods if negotiations are not successful such action could subject an even wider range of juniper products to tariff on importation into the us depending upon its duration and implementation as well as our ability to mitigate their impact these tariffs could materially affect our business including in the form of increased cost of goods sold increased pricing for customers and reduced sales 

governmental regulation of encryption or ip networking technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or related economic sanctions could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues and operating results in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in harm to our reputation and ability to compete in international markets penalties costs seizure of assets including source code and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or governmentfunded projects 

 27 

our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a wide variety of provincial state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these privacy and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations further our legal and regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to unexpected changes including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations to issues rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties significantly compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development and offering of new products and services 

for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance than the eu laws that previously applied additionally california recently enacted legislation the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which will become effective january 1 2020 the ccpa will among other requirements require covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and allow such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the ccpa before the effective date it remains unclear the extent of the modifications that will be made to the ccpa or how such modifications will be interpreted the effects of the ccpa potentially are significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply we may also be subject to additional obligations relating to personal data by contract that industry standards apply to our practices our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data or to protect personal data from unauthorized access use or other processing could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals fines damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business further evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the eu the us uk and elsewhere including the classification of ip addresses machine identification information location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting business relationships and partnerships that may involve the sharing or uses of data and may require significant costs resources and efforts in order to comply 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people with specialized industry expertise is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

a number of our team members are foreign nationals who rely on visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the united states and other countries in recent years the united states has increased the level of scrutiny in granting h1b l1 and other business visas in addition the current us administration has made immigration reform a priority compliance with united states immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals any of these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

we are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill annually or more frequently if certain circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible assets below their carrying values as of december 31 2018  our goodwill was 31088 million  and our intangible assets with indefinite lives was 490 million  when the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill or if the carrying amount of an intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value a charge to operations is recorded either event would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred we have in the past recorded goodwill impairment charges declines in our level of revenues or declines in our operating margins or sustained declines in our stock price increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives may become impaired in future periods 

 28 

our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis such as expected future cash flows the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets and our stock price if the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets however any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by the following earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement costs related to intercompany restructuring tax effects of sharebased compensation challenges to our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof for example on july 24 2018 the ninth circuit court of appeals or the court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement to share expenses related to sharebased compensation on august 7 2018 the court withdrew its opinion to allow time for a reconstituted panel to confer we are monitoring this case and any impact the final opinion may have on our financial statements in addition the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” which was signed into law on december 22 2017 made significant changes to the taxation of us business entities that may have a meaningful impact to our provision for income taxes these changes included a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate the current taxation of certain foreign earnings the imposition of baseerosion prevention measures which may limit the deduction of certain transfer pricing payments and possible limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or corporate debt obligations accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act required significant judgments and estimates that are based on current interpretations of the tax act the us department of the treasury continues to issue proposed regulations that affect various components of the act our future effective tax rate may be impacted by changes in interpretation of the regulations as well as additional legislation and guidance regarding the act 

furthermore on october 5 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development or oecd an international association of 35 countries including the us published final proposals under its base erosion and profit shifting or beps action plan the beps action plan includes fifteen actions to address beps in a comprehensive manner and represents a significant change to the international corporate tax landscape these proposals as adopted by countries may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service or irs and other tax authorities it is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes but the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made there can be no assurance that the outcomes from continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our ability to compete 

we generally rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology any of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings and other competitive harm 

 29 

in addition despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that the agreements we have entered into will not be breached we cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 

furthermore the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the united states in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic business regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the uk’s exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit has caused and may continue to cause uncertainty in the global markets brexit if implemented   will take some period of time to complete and could result in regulatory changes that impact our business for example changes to the way service providers conduct business and transmit data between the uk and the eu could require us to make changes to the way we handle customer data we will also review the impact of any resulting 

 30 

changes to eu or uk law that could affect our operations such as labor policies financial planning product manufacturing and product distribution political and regulatory responses to the vote are still developing and we are in the process of assessing the impact the vote may have on our business as more information becomes available nevertheless because we conduct business in the eu including the uk any of the effects of brexit including those we cannot anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

there remains significant risk that the uk will exit from the eu on march 30 2019 without agreement between the eu and uk on terms addressing customs and trade matters if it occurs this “hard brexit” scenario would mean among other things that as of march 30 2019 uk customs would have to clear a far greater daily volume of imports than it has ever had to before if uk customs is not able to handle such increased volume as of the end of march significant delays in imports may very well result thereby potentially producing a shortterm material adverse effect on our business hard brexit could result in further shortterm uncertainty and currency volatility additional currency volatility could drive a weaker british pound which increases the cost of goods imported into our uk operations and may decrease the profitability of our uk operations a weaker british pound versus the us dollar also causes local currency results of our uk operations to be translated into fewer us dollars during a reporting period any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of brexit could result in significant time and expense to complete our business is also impacted by the negotiation and implementation of free trade agreements between the united states and other nations such agreements can reduce barriers to international trade and thus the cost of conducting business overseas for instance the united states recently reached a new trilateral trade agreement with the governments of canada and mexico to replace the north american free trade agreement nafta if the united states withdraws from nafta and the three countries fail to approve the new agreement known as the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca our cost of doing business within the three countries could increase 

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the united states or in other countries in which we operate in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors channel partners and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in termination of our relationship financial reporting problems fines andor penalties for us or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected defects errors or malware or do not meet customer quality expectations our business could be adversely affected and we may be subject to additional costs or lawsuits or be required to pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities these errors may arise from hardware or software we produce or procure from third parties some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers 

any errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in monetary penalties negative publicity loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and reputation penalties and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition in the event an error defect malware or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty or indemnification defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed moreover if our products fail to satisfy our customers quality expectations for whatever reason the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

because a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 31 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound chinese yuan euro and indian rupee related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars this could negatively affect our ability to meet our customers pricing expectations in those markets and may result in erosion of gross margin and market share a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows with the aim of offsetting the impact of currency fluctuations on these exposures however hedge activities can be costly and hedging cannot fully offset all risks including longterm declines or appreciation in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines or appreciation in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to effectively improve our systems and processes or we fail to monitor and ensure that these systems and processes are being used correctly our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or are not available on terms acceptable to us our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to renegotiate our current thirdparty licenses or license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the failure to comply with the terms of any license including free open source software may result in our inability to continue to use such license some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them in addition we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products third party technology we incorporate into our products that is deemed to infringe on the intellectual property of others may result and in some cases has resulted in limitations on our ability to source technology from those third parties restrictions on our ability to sell products that incorporate the infringing technology increased exposure to liability that we will be held responsible for incorporating the infringing technology in our products and increased costs involved in removing that technology from our products or developing substitute technology our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us if possible to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 32 

we rely on the availability and performance of information technology services provided by third parties including ibm which will manage a significant portion of our systems 

under the terms of our recent master services agreement and certain statements of work following a transition period ibm will provide us with a broad range of information technology services such as applications including support development and maintenance infrastructure management and support including for servers storage and network devices and end user support including service desk we expect that our businesses will become dependent on the services provided and systems operated for us by ibm and its thirdparty providers while we believe that we conducted appropriate due diligence before entering into this agreement the failure of one or more of these entities to meet our performance standards and expectations including with respect to data security may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our success is dependent on our ability to maintain effective relationships with ibm and other thirdparty technology and service providers as well as the ability of ibm and any other thirdparty providers to perform as expected we may terminate our agreement with ibm and any and all statements of work at any time on short notice for cause convenience certain specific performance failures a breach of warranties by ibm failure to transition failure to transform changes in law force majeure or a change in   the control of either ibm or us depending on the type and timing of a termination we may be required to pay certain termination amounts to ibm ibms only right to terminate the agreement is based on our failure to comply with certain terms applying to disputed payments 

our ability to realize the expected benefits of this arrangement is subject to various risks some of which are not within our complete control these risks include but are not limited to disruption in services and the failure to protect the security and integrity of the companys data under the terms of the agreement we are unable to provide assurances that some or all of these risks will not occur failure to effectively mitigate these risks if they occur could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition we could face significant additional costs or business disruption if our arrangement with ibm is terminated or impaired and we cannot find alternative it services or support on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis or if we are unable to hire new employees in order to return these services inhouse 

we are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and publicly disclose material weaknesses in our controls any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception and our stock price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness or significant deficiency investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major credit rating agencies routinely evaluate our indebtedness this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

we may be unable to generate the cash flow to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our debt obligations including the notes and the revolving credit facility 

as of december 31 2018  we have issued 21500 million  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes which we refer to collectively as the notes and had 21390 million  in total outstanding debt including 350 million of senior notes that mature in february 2019 in june 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a fiveyear 5000 million  unsecured revolving credit facility which we refer to as the revolving credit facility with an option to increase the revolving credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million  the credit agreement will terminate in june 2019 at which point all amounts borrowed must be repaid as of december 31 2018  no amounts were outstanding under the credit agreement 

 33 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon our ability to pay our expenses satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance which will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control based upon current levels of operations we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon however if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt we may be required to sell assets reduce capital expenditures refinance all or a portion of our existing debt including the notes or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the indentures that govern the notes contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

the credit agreement contains two financial covenants along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following 

 

 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business a failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default in addition in the event of an acceleration we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments including those under the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon 

in addition certain changes under the tax act may result in limitations on the deductibility of our net business interest expenses the tax act generally limits the annual deduction for net business interest expense to an amount equal to 30 of adjusted taxable income as a result if our taxable income were to decline we may not be able to fully deduct our net interest expense these changes among others under the tax act could result in increases to our future us tax expenses which could have a material impact on our business 

a portion of the transaction consideration we received from the divestiture of our junos pulse product portfolio is in the form of a noncontingent seller promissory note and we may not receive the amount owed to us including accrued interest including in the time frame contemplated by the buyer under the note 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed the sale of our junos pulse product portfolio to an affiliate of siris capital a private equity firm for total consideration of 2307 million of which 1250 million was in the form of an 18month noncontingent interestbearing promissory note issued to the company on may 1 2017 we received a principal payment in the amount of 750 million and outstanding interest on the note and we and the issuer agreed to further amend the terms of the note with respect to the remaining approximately 580 million to among other things extend the maturity date from december 31 2018 to september 30 2022 provide that interest due can be paid in kind by increasing the outstanding principal amount of the note and subordinate the note to other debt issued by senior lenders since a portion of the transaction consideration is in the form of a noncontingent seller promissory note and the note is subordinated to debt issued by senior lenders there is the risk that we may not receive the amount owed to us including accrued interest including in the time frame contemplated under the note in the event that the promissory note is not repaid on the terms we contemplate any collection or restructuring efforts we undertake 

 34 

may be costly and require significant time and attention from our management and there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover the amounts owed to us in full 

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends or achieve our intended capital return policy will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital and debt service requirements use of cash for acquisitions and other factors any failure to pay or increase future dividends as announced or a reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

in november 2018 we announced that for 2019 we intend to target a capital return policy inclusive of share repurchases and dividends of approximately 75 of annual free cash flow free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures in january 2018 we announced that our board of directors approved a new 20 billion buyback authorization which replaced our prior authorization in february 2018 as a part of our new buyback authorization we entered into a 7500 million accelerated share repurchase program or asr which was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and our board of directors declared an increase to our quarterly cash dividend to 018 per share which reflects an increase of 80 compared to previous quarterly dividends in january 2019 our board of directors declared an increase to our quarterly cash dividend to 019 per share any failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities and equity securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at december 31 2018  we had 24890 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 12691 million  in shortand longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in assetbacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities money market funds mutual funds time deposits us government agency securities and us government securities we also have 904 million in other longterm assets for our investments in privatelyheld companies certain of our investments are subject to general credit liquidity market sovereign debt and interest rate risks our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction the us district court for the district of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law our restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws iv any action or proceeding asserting a claim as to which delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction on the court of chancery or v any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could have a material and adverse impact on our business 

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation cybersecurity and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis in addition our insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us 

 35 

for all losses or failures that may occur losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our stock price may fluctuate 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies from time to time economic weakness has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have also reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future

executive overview 

business and market environment 

juniper designs develops and sells products and services for highperformance networks to enable customers to build scalable reliable secure and costeffective networks for their businesses while achieving agility and improved operating efficiency through automation 

our products are sold in three geographic regions americas europe middle east and africa or emea and asia pacific or apac we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings across routing switching and security technologies in addition to our products we offer our customers services including maintenance and support professional services and education and training programs our products and services address highperformance network requirements for our customers within our verticals cloud service provider and enterprise who view their network as critical to their success we believe our silicon systems and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking helping our customers achieve superior performance greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership 

further our intent is to expand our software business by introducing new software solutions to our product portfolio that simplify the operation of networks and allow our customers across our key verticals flexibility in consumption and deployment we believe our software revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase over time as we introduce new software product offerings and business models designed to better monetize the value of our software offerings 

we believe the network needs for our customers in our cloud service provider and enterprise verticals are converging as these customers recognize the need for high performance networks and are adopting cloud architectures for their infrastructure and service delivery such as large public and private data centers and service provider edge data centers for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency 

in 2018 we continued to experience weakness within our cloud and service provider verticals in our cloud vertical certain large cloud customers were transitioning their network architecture as they continued to add capacity this resulted in these customers transitioning from purchasing our mx product family to our ptx product family which contributed to the decline in our net revenues as the ptx product family has a lower average selling price compared to the mx product family we believe the mx to ptx transition is largely behind us however the pace of deployments in a portion of our cloud customer’s networks has been slower than expected nevertheless we are focused on the cloud vertical as well as the transition to 400gig ethernet or 400g which we believe will present further opportunities for juniper across our portfolio as our cloud customers value highperformance highly compact power efficient infrastructures which we support and continue to develop 

 41 

in our service provider vertical changes in business models and the increase in industry consolidation such as acquisitions mergers and partnerships may continue to impact service provider investment and the buildout of their networks in the nearterm however we believe that our service provider customers will need to invest in the buildout of high performance networks and the transformation of existing legacy infrastructure to distributed cloud environments we are committed to this transformation which we refer to as the telco cloud transformation as our service provider customers rearchitect their infrastructure to enable among other things next generation mobile network buildouts or 5g we are well positioned to capitalize on 5g carrier deployments with the refresh of our mx 5g product and contrail solutions as well as our new partnership with ericsson to accelerate 5g initiatives by leveraging each company’s complementary portfolios to drive our competitive advantage in the marketplace we believe these products and partnership position juniper for improved service provider spending in late 2019 

we remain confident in our strategy and we are executing against our innovation roadmap as each of our industry verticals transitions to cloud architectures we believe our understanding of highperformance networking technology and cloud architecture and our strategy position us to capitalize on the industry transition to more automated costefficient scalable networks 

in 2018 we continued to execute on our product and solutions strategy and announced several new innovations including a new 400g optimized routing platform a new highperformance mx series 5g universal routing platform with new programmable silicon an upgrade to our highend srx firewall offering with our spc3 advanced security acceleration line card and our multicloud orchestration and telemetry platform including contrail edge cloud and contrail enterprise multicloud each of which we believe will help strengthen our position across our core markets we also announced new initiatives under an existing partnership with nutanix which we expect will help strengthen our ability to capitalize on multicloud with our contrail enterprise multicloud integration with nutanix’s application programming interface or apis to provide enhanced network visibility 

in late 2018 we completed the acquisition of htbase a software company that has developed a unique and disruptive platform for softwaredefined enterprise multicloud which we expect will accelerate our leadership in multicloud and function with the compute orchestration capabilities of contrail enterprise multicloud we will continue to look at targeted and strategic acquisitions that we believe can complement our portfolio operations rd strategy and overall business 

in 2019 we believe we will continue to experience weakness with our cloud customers in the nearterm as deployment cycles remain difficult to predict however we remain confident in our competitive position with our strategic cloud customers we are taking a number of actions that we believe will help juniper achieve yearoveryear revenue growth at some point in the second half of 2019 such as 1 new product offerings which include new mx line cards to capitalize on 5g carrier initiatives 400g platforms to capture data center footprint and new enhancements to our contrail enterprise multicloud platform that make it simpler and more cost effective 2 transitioning our sales organization to better align with our sales strategy and 3 monetizing our software offerings through subscriptions further we believe the 400g upgrade cycle 5g deployments and enterprise multicloud initiatives each represent large opportunities where are well positioned to benefit over the next several years

financial results and key performance metrics overview   

on january 1 2018 we adopted financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards update or asu no 201409 topic 606  revenue from contracts with customers which we refer to as   topic 606 the standard provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in accounting standards codification topic 605 revenue recognition which we refer to as topic 605 and most industry specific guidance see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on the adoption of topic 606 results for reporting periods beginning after january 1 2018 are presented under topic 606 while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the historic accounting under topic 605 

the following table provides an overview of our financial results and key financial metrics in millions except per share amounts percentages and days sales outstanding or dso 



 

 

 

 43 

during 2018  the adoption of topic 606 resulted in a decrease in revenue recognition of 226 million  due to lower service revenues partially offset by higher product revenues service revenues during 2018  were lower by 1229 million  under topic 606 compared to topic 605 primarily due to the impact of revenue allocation between products and services product revenues during 2018  were higher by 1003 million  under topic 606 compared to topic 605 primarily due to the impact of revenue allocation between products and services and the timing of revenue recognition of certain contracts that were precluded by topic 605 partially offset by variable consideration the product revenues increase from topic 606 was primarily allocated between routing and switching 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates   

the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer liabilities assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our significant accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

 44 

 

goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recorded the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of november 1 st  or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment level by comparing the reporting units carrying value including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating results of the component 

the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test various factors are considered in the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions financial performance or a sustained decrease in share price if as a result of the qualitative assessment it is deemed more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount management will perform the quantitative test 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test if necessary involves a twostep process to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the first step tests for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit’s carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the second step requires an assignment of the reporting unit’s fair value to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities using the relevant acquisition accounting guidance to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill and if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

in the first step the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using both the income and market valuation approaches we believe the income approach and the market approach are equally representative of the reporting unit’s fair value under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publiclytraded companies in similar lines of business in the application of the income and market valuation approaches we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units and then apply a control premium which is determined by 

 45 

considering control premiums offered as part of the acquisitions that have occurred in market segments that are comparable with our reporting units the income approach and the market approach are equally weighted to derive the fair value of the reporting unit 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 we performed a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units routing switching and security this quantitative assessment was performed by determining the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach based on the results of the quantitative assessments we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value resulting in no goodwill impairment 

 

we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  our contract manufacturer liabilities were 304 million  and 220 million  respectively 

significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory and obsolete material exposures we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and contract manufacturer liabilities which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 

 

our estimates of ssp for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels gross margin objectives internal costs competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles our estimates for rights of return rebates and price protection are based on historical sales returns and price protection credits specific criteria outlined in customer contracts or rebate agreements and other factors known at the time our estimates for expected penalties and other price concessions are based on historical trends and expectations regarding future incurrence 

changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 

 46 

 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules in addition the oecd’s recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles as adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

results of operations 

revenues 

the following table presents net revenues by product and service customer vertical   and geographic region in millions except percentages 



 

 

2018  compared to 2017   

product net revenues decreased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to cloud and service provider impacting routing and switching in the americas the decrease  in product revenues was partially offset by the impact of topic 606 and growth in enterprise 

the decrease  in routing and switching revenues in the americas was driven by the networking architectural transitions for certain large cloud customers due to the timing of deployments and a decline in our service provider business resulting in lower net revenues from our mx ptx and qfx product families for ptx the decline was primarily due to the pace of deployments for certain large cloud customers we believe ptx sales will increase as incremental capacity requirements eventually drive improved demand the decline was partially offset by broadbased revenue growth in enterprise across all technologies and geographies given the strength in our enterprise vertical strong customer interest in our new platforms such as contrail enterprise multicloud and mx10003 and the investments we are making in our enterprise sales strategy we believe our enterprise vertical will continue to contribute to revenue growth in 2019 we also saw strength in emea driven by the aforementioned revenue growth in enterprise 

 48 

as well as higher revenues from service provider customers resulting from our solutions based sales strategy to enable the telco cloud transformation and enterprise multicloud initiatives 

we experienced growth in revenues from our security business during 2018  compared to 2017  across all verticals as customers transitioned to our newer product offerings we expect that our security business will see yearoveryear growth for the full year 2019  

service net revenues decreased during 2018  compared to 2017  due to the impact of topic 606 excluding the impact of topic 606 our service net revenues would have increased yearoveryear driven primarily by strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts 

2017  compared to 2016   

product net revenues decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in routing and to a lesser extent security partially offset by growth in switching 

lower routing revenues were driven by cloud customers in the americas as a result of the ongoing architectural shifts in the cloud vertical to more automated cost efficient and scalable networks routing revenues in emea also declined yearoveryear due to lower sales from service provider customers partially offset by revenue growth in apac from our service provider vertical as we continue to expand our footprint with certain strategic apac service provider and cloud customers we expect these strategic opportunities will ultimately help to drive revenue growth in apac however the timing is difficult to predict revenues from our mx and legacy routing products declined yearoveryear which was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our ptx products from the continued adoption of our ptx1000 series of products 

security net revenues declined in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by a decrease in our highend srx series as it had been undergoing a product refresh cycle and the decline in our other legacy products 

the decline in product net revenues was partially offset by an increase in switching net revenues due to continued growth from our data center switching portfolio particularly from our qfx product family which grew 25 yearoveryear this growth was across public and private clouds driven in part by 100g adoption the switching net revenue growth was primarily driven by the cloud vertical in the americas and to a lesser extent our enterprise vertical 

service net revenues increased during in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts additionally we saw strong yearoveryear services revenue growth in apac and emea 

customer 

no customer accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



our gross margins as a percentage of net revenues have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the mix and average selling prices of our products and services new product introductions and enhancements manufacturing component and logistics costs expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations cost of support and service personnel customer mix as we continue to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers the mix of distribution channels through

which our products and services are sold and import tariffs for example the united states recently imposed a tariff on networking products imported from china which includes certain products that we import into and sell within the united states these import tariffs could have a significant impact to our gross margins in the event we are unable to meaningfully mitigate their impact for more information on the potential impact of tariffs on our business see the “risk factors” section of item 1a of part ii of this report  

2018  compared to 2017   

product gross margin 

product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to lower net revenues and product mix resulting from the yearoveryear decline in routing revenues from our cloud and service provider verticals partially offset by the impact of topic 606 and improvements in our cost structure we continue to undertake specific efforts to address certain factors impacting our product gross margin these efforts include performance and quality improvements through engineering to increase value across our products optimizing our supply chain and service business pricing management and increasing software and solution sales however there can be no guarantee that these efforts will be successful or that they will be realized in the time frame we anticipate 

service gross margin 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues decreased in 2018  compared to 2017  due to lower revenues from the impact of topic 606 increased professional services costs to support our software deployments and higher service delivery costs partially offset by lower personnelrelated costs 

2017  compared to 2016

 50 

our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnelrelated costs including salaries and wages commissions and bonuses which we refer to collectively as variable compensation benefits sharebased compensation and travel facility and information technology or it departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount we had a total of 9283 9381 and 9832 employees as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our headcount decreased by 98 employees or 1 in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to our restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of 2018  to realign our workforce as a result of organizational and leadership changes which we refer to as the 2018  restructuring plan our headcount decreased by 451 employees or 5 in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to our restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2017 to realign our workforce and increase operational efficiency which we refer to as the 2017 restructuring plan 

2018  compared to 2017   

research and development 

research and development expense or rd increased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs including an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 344 million driven by higher expense from the modification of certain performance share awards or psas whose vesting is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones and higher variable compensation expense of 178 million the increase was partially offset by lower salaries and wages of 267 million due to a geographic shift in headcount to lower cost regions as well as a reduction in headcount from restructuring actions 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense decreased  in 2018  compared to 2017  due to lower personnelrelated costs of 109 million primarily resulting from a decline in headcount of 49 employees driven by restructuring actions and lower costs of 93 million from a decrease in the number of marketing events held in 2018 compared to 2017 the decrease  was partially offset by higher outside service costs of 71 million related to consulting projects 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to higher acquisition costs related to our 2018 business acquisition of htbase partially offset by a decline in outside service costs resulting from fewer consulting projects and lower legal costs 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges decreased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to lower restructuring charges from the 2018 restructuring plan compared to the 2017 restructuring plan 

see note 18 subsequent events  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for a discussion of our restructuring plan initiated subsequent to december 31 2018  

2017  compared to 2016   

research and development 

research and development expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decline in personnelrelated costs including lower sharebased compensation of 398 million primarily driven by lower expense from certain psas whose vesting is contingent upon the achievement of financial performance metrics or certain performance milestones and lower variable compensation of 137 million the decrease was partially offset by higher costs related to certain rd project cancellations of 114 million and higher prototype costs of 104 million 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decline in personnelrelated costs of 205 million including lower variable compensation of 155 million primarily as a result of lower commissions expense and lower salaries and wages driven by a decrease in headcount as a result of the 2017 restructuring plan 

 51 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to litigation settlement charges pursuant to a litigation settlement reached in november 2017 in connection with a legal proceeding of approximately 130 million partially offset by a decline in other legal costs of 64 million 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to severance and contract termination costs recorded under the 2017 restructuring plan 

other expense net 

the following table presents other expense net in millions except percentages 



 

nm  percentage is not meaningful 

other expense net 

interest income primarily includes interest earned on our cash cash equivalents investments and promissory note issued to us in connection with the sale of junos pulse interest expense primarily includes interest net of capitalized interest expense from longterm debt and customer financing arrangements loss gain on investments net primarily includes gains from the sale of investments in public and privatelyheld companies and any observable changes in fair value and impairment charges recorded on these investments other typically consists of foreign exchange gains and losses and other nonoperational income and expense items 

2018  compared to 2017   

  

interest income 

interest income increased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to higher interest income related to our fixed income investment portfolio as a result of higher yields on our investments partially offset by lower average investment balances 

interest expense 

interest expense increased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to distributor financing arrangements from extended payment terms financing 

loss gain on investments net 

during the year ended december 31 2018  we had losses related to the sale of certain equity investments in privatelyheld companies compared to gains on sales during 2017  in addition we recorded impairment charges on a certain equity investment in a privatelyheld company in 2018  and there were no such charges recorded in 2017  

 52 

2017  compared to 2016   

interest income 

interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in interest income related to our investment portfolio as a result of higher yields and a larger balance in the portfolio 

interest expense 

interest expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a fullyear effect of interest expense from the issuance of our 2019 and 2024 notes in the first quarter of 2016 see note 10 debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2019 and 2024 notes 

gain loss on investments net 

in 2017 gains on equity investments increased primarily related to the sale of investments in public and privatelyheld companies compared to 2016 in addition we recorded impairment charges on certain investments in privatelyheld companies in 2016 and there were no such charges recorded in 2017 

  

income tax benefit provision 

the following table presents the income tax benefit provision in millions except percentages 



2018  compared to 2017   

the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018  is lower than 2017 primarily due to a lower statutory tax rate as a result of the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 a 676 million related to a lapse in the federal statute of limitations relative to tax years 2010 through 2014 including interest a 332 million benefit as a result of filing a change in tax accounting method for the recognition of deferred product revenue in the us to better align with the financial statement recognition of such revenue a 322 million resulting from a tax accounting method change related to foreign deferred service revenue a favorable change in the geographic mix of earnings and discrete taxes of approximately 2895 million accrued on accumulated foreign earnings under the tax act in the fourth quarter ended december 31 2017 

the tax act introduced significant changes to us income tax law effective january 1 2018 the tax act reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and created a minimum tax on foreign earnings and imposed a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings through december 31 2017 in 2017 we recorded provisional amounts for the effects of the tax act of 2895 million primarily related to net taxes on accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets at the revised us statutory rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our analysis to determine the effect of the tax act and recorded immaterial adjustments as of december 31 2018 we have elected to pay our transition tax net of applicable tax refunds over the eightyear period provided in the tax act 

for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 and further explanation of our income tax provision see note 14 income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

on july 24 2018 the ninth circuit court of appeals or the court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement to share expenses related to sharebased compensation on august 7 2018 the court withdrew its opinion to allow time for a reconstituted panel to confer we will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to its financial statements had the ninth circuit not withdrawn its opinion our effective tax rate for 2018 would have been higher 

 53 

our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates our effective tax rate may also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items see item 1a of part i risk factors of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results 

2017  compared to 2016   

the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 was higher than 2016 primarily due to an estimated 2895 million of net income tax expense related to changes imposed by the tax act which was enacted on december 22 2017 effective january 1 2018 the tax act provided for significant changes to us income tax law including the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and the creation of a minimum tax on foreign earnings in addition the tax act imposed a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings through december 31 2017 the 2895 million income tax expense included an estimated tax charge of 4312 million on our accumulated foreign earnings which we elected to pay over eight years 

as a result of recommendations by the organisation for economic cooperation and development or oecd on base erosion and profit shifting certain countries in emea and apac have either enacted new corporate tax legislation or are considering enacting such legislation in the near future we expect the effect of these reform measures to potentially impact longstanding tax principles particularly in regards to transfer pricing consequently we expect global tax authorities to increasingly challenge our cost sharing and other intercompany arrangements and the related sourcing of taxable profits in global jurisdictions 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital return strategy including our stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and the issuance of our longterm debt the following table presents our capital resources in millions except percentages 



 

nm  percentage is not meaningful 

 54 

summary of cash flows 

the following table summarizes cash flow activity from our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions except percentages 



 

 

operating activities 

our primary source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnelrelated expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

2018  compared to 2017   

net cash provided by operations decreased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to higher cash collections from customers during 2017  related to service renewals invoiced during the fourth quarter of 2016 partially offset by a decline in cash paid for personnelrelated costs principally as a result of a reduction in headcount and lower incentive compensation and a decrease in payments to suppliers 

2017  compared to 2016   

net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in cash collections from customers in the first half of 2017 due to higher invoicing activity during the fourth quarter of 2016 partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers higher payments for restructuring activities and an increase in cash paid for income taxes 

investing activities   

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures purchases sales maturities and redemptions of investments and cash used for business combinations 

2018  compared to 2017   

net cash provided by investing activities increased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to the liquidation of repatriated offshore investments to fund the accelerated share repurchase program discussed below 

2017  compared to 2016   

net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower payments for business combinations and capital expenditures and the receipt of 750 million in proceeds from the pulse note partially offset by higher net purchases of availableforsale debt securities 

 55 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock payment of cash dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans 

2018  compared to 2017   

net cash used in financing activities increased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to an increase in payments of cash dividends and higher repurchases of our common stock as a result of the accelerated share repurchase program or asr described further below 

2017  compared to 2016   

net cash used in financing activities increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of our common stock in 2017 in 2016 we raised 4940 million from our 2019 notes and 2024 notes and repaid 3000 million of our 2016 notes 

capital return 

the following table summarizes our dividends paid and stock repurchase activities in millions except per share amounts 



in january 2018 our board of directors which we refer to as the board approved a 20 billion  share repurchase program which we refer to as the 2018 stock repurchase program the 2018 stock repurchase program replaces the previous authorization approved by the board in 2014 

as part of the 2018 stock repurchase program we entered into an asr to repurchase 7500 million  of our common stock we made an upfront payment of 7500 million  pursuant to the asr to repurchase our common stock the aggregate number of shares ultimately repurchased of 293 million  shares of common stock was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price less an agreed upon discount of 2562  per share 

as of december 31 2018  there was 13 billion  of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 stock repurchase program as of the filing date of this report 

future share repurchases under the 2018 stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements our 2018 stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time see note 11 equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our share purchase program 

in addition any future dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates are subject to approval by the board or an authorized committee thereof see note 18 subsequent event  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for discussion of our dividend declaration subsequent to december 31 2018  

 56 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however in the normal course of business we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and insurance programs see guarantees  below for additional information regarding our guarantees 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments debt and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 



 

 

as of december 31 2018  we had 1592 million  included in longterm income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes as a result this amount is not included in the table above 

revolving credit facility 

as of december 31 2018  we have not borrowed any funds and we were in compliance with all covenants under our unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in 2019 which enables borrowings up to 5000 million  with the option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million  see note 10 debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further information on our credit facility 

guarantees 

we have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products solely or in combination with other third party products infringe the intellectual property rights of a thirdparty as of december 31 2018  we recorded 119 million  for such indemnification obligations in other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets we also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and insurance programs of 231 million  and 230 million  as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively 

 57 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions investments in strategic relationships repurchases of additional shares of our common stock and payment of cash dividends on our common stock following the enactment of the tax act we repatriated approximately 28 billion of our cash cash equivalents and investments balance from outside of the us as of december 31 2018  we expect the new territorial tax system to provide us lower cost access to nearly all of our global free cash flow on an ongoing basis free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we intend to use the repatriated cash to invest in the business support valueenhancing merger and acquisitions or ma and fund our return of capital to stockholders 

in august 2016 we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec enabling us to offer for sale from time to time an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions our 2019 notes and 2024 notes were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement that we filed in august 2013 pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the sec on february 24 2016 our 2020 notes and 2025 notes were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the sec on february 26 2015 and our 3500 million in principal amount of our 2024 notes which form a single series and are fully fungible with our 2024 notes issued in 2016 were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to a prospectus filed with the sec on february 28 2014 any offerings of securities under our automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus in addition our revolving credit facility will also provide additional flexibility for future liquidity needs 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations planned stock repurchases and dividends capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including but not limited to our growth rate the timing and amount we spend to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services the costs to acquire or invest in businesses and technologies an increase in manufacturing or component costs and the risks and uncertainties detailed in the “risk factors” section of item 1a of part i of this report 

 58 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk   

  

the primary objectives of our investment activities are in order of priority to preserve principal maintain liquidity and maximize yield the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility to minimize this risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities which includes assetbacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities money market funds mutual funds time deposits us government agency securities and us government securities at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our availableforsale fixed income securities held as of december 31 2018  and 2017  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points or bps 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate in millions 





foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies these foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately three  months 

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound chinese yuan euro and the indian rupee approximately 78 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of seventeen  months or less the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was a reduction to operating expenses of 01 for both years ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively see note 5 derivative instruments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our derivative and hedging activity 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december 31 2018  and as of december 31 2017  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of nonus dollar cash cash equivalents and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10 movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash cash equivalents and investments we would report in us dollars as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  by less than 11 and by less than 1 respectively 

 59 

equity price risk   

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies depending on the nature of these investments some can be carried at cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer less impairment and others can be carried at fair value the carrying values of our investments in privatelyheld companies were 904 million  and 830 million   as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively the privatelyheld companies in which we invest can still be considered in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privatelyheld companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

from inception we have focused on designing developing and building highperformance network infrastructure for the worlds most demanding networking environments we consistently deliver leading technologies that transform the economics and experience of networking—significantly improving customer economics by lowering the capital expenditures required to build networks and the operating expenses required to manage and maintain them we believe that many customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors and that the scale performance reliability and security of our products provides us with a competitive advantage which is critical to being selected as one of those vendors 

be a strategic partner to our customers 

in developing our solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build bestinclass products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers which has enabled us to design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date we plan to continue to work with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as to design products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace while enabling customers to reduce costs we are committed to investing in research and development or rd at a level that drives our innovation agenda enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers 

establish and develop industry partnerships 

our customers have diverse requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders with diverse technologies and services that extend the value of the network to our customers these partnerships ensure that our customers have access to those technologies and services whether through technology integration joint development resale or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers requirements in addition we believe an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs 

customer verticals 

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales distributors valueadded resellers or vars and original equipment manufacturers or oems to endusers in the following verticals cloud telecomcable and strategic enterprise in 2017 we began reporting revenue on these verticals which we believe better aligns with our business model compared to our previous reporting of revenue by service provider and enterprise a summary of the types of customers included in our verticals is discussed below 

further we believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our key customers by

cloud 

our cloud vertical includes companies that are heavily reliant on the cloud for their business model’s success as an example customers in the cloud vertical can include cloud service providers as well as enterprises that provide softwareasaservice or saas infrastructureasaservice or platformasaservice 

cloud customers value highperformance highly compact power efficient infrastructures which we support and continue to develop in addition as these customers are pushing the envelope in networking our focus on collaboration combined with networking innovation around automation has made us a strategic partner with these cloud customers helping them develop high performance and lower total cost of ownership networking solutions to support their business 

telecomcable 

our telecomcable vertical includes wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators and we support most of the major carrier and operator networks in the world with our highperformance network infrastructure offerings in recent years we have seen increased convergence of these different types of customers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships telecomcable customers are increasingly investing in the buildout of high performance networks and the transformation of existing legacy infrastructure to distributed cloud environments in order to satisfy the growth in mobile traffic and video as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including smartphones tablets and connected devices of various kinds 

further as these customers prepare for next generation mobile network buildouts or 5g which we expect to begin to occur over the next few years as well as create new approaches to delivering value to their enterprise customers we believe these opportunities will present further opportunities for juniper across our portfolio the need for a highly efficient infrastructure to handle large amounts of data along with low latency or minimal delay plays into the need to have a high performance scalable infrastructure in combination with the automation and flexibility required to drive down operational costs and rapidly provision applications as our telecomcable customers prepare for 5g we expect that network function virtualization or nfv and softwaredefined networking or sdn will be critical elements to enable our customers the flexibility to achieve the business use cases around internet of things or iot enhanced mobile video support and dynamic new service deployments with our focus on delivering a strong portfolio of network virtualization and softwarebased orchestration solutions we believe we will be poised to deliver on the automation and agility requirements needs of the telecomcable vertical 

strategic enterprise 

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the worlds most demanding enterprises we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers as well as branch and campus applications our strategic enterprise vertical includes enterprises not included in the cloud vertical in particular they are industries with high performance high agility requirements including financial services national federal state and local governments as well as research and educational institutions we believe that our strategic enterprise customers are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications 

innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the strategic enterprise vertical we believe that as these customers transition their workloads to the cloud they will seek greater flexibility in how they consume networking and security services whether they plan to move to a public cloud or hybrid cloud which is a mix of public and private cloud as well as a growing number of saas applications architecture these are key technology areas where we are innovating highperformance enterprises require ip networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance reliability and security with bestinclass open architecture solutions for maximum flexibility 

in 2017  2016  and 2015  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues

platform strategy   

in addition to our major hardware product families and services our software portfolio has been a key technology element in our goal to be a leader in highperformance networking 

our junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers at the heart of the junos platform is junos os we believe junos os is fundamentally differentiated from other network operating systems not only in its design but also in its development capabilities the advantages of junos os include 

 

 

 

junos os is designed to improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades this operational efficiency allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenuegenerating applications helping to advance the economics of highperformance networking 

the security and stability of junos os combined with its modular architecture and common source code base provides a foundation for delivering performance reliability security and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments with junos os as the single operating system that powers our broad portfolio of physical and virtual networking and security products we believe junos os provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors 

orchestration and monitoring products 

as many of our customers are moving to a hybrid multicloud environment managing orchestrating and securing that complex environment can be a challenge we are committed to providing solutions to simplify networking operations to help our customers to optimize their infrastructure and workload placement across their hybrid multicloud environment with the following offerings

sales and marketing 

as of december 31 2017  we employed 2474 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals business development teams systems engineers marketing teams channel teams and an operational infrastructure team are generally distributed between vertical markets within each team sales team members serve the following three geographic regions i americas including united states canada mexico caribbean and central and south america ii emea and iii apac within each region there are regional and country teams as well as vertical market focused teams to ensure we operate close to our customers 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships as described below 

we sell to a number of cloud and telecomcable customers directly otherwise we sell to all of our key customer verticals primarily through distributors and resellers 

direct sales structure 

the terms and conditions of direct purchasing arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our order acknowledgment terms for those orders or by purchase contracts the direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

channel sales structure 

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales we utilize various channel partners including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 10 

manufacturing and operations 

as of december 31 2017  we employed 326  people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our supply chain which include our contract manufacturers original design manufacturers component suppliers warehousing and logistics 

our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in the united states or us china malaysia mexico and taiwan as of december 31 2017  we utilized celestica incorporated flextronics international ltd accton technology corporation and alpha networks inc for the majority of our manufacturing activity our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement surface mount assembly final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required for our products to meet internal and external quality standards we believe that these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

 

 

 

our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to agreedupon specifications products are then shipped to our distributors vars or endusers generally we do not own the components title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the contract manufacturers location customers take title to the products upon delivery at a specified destination if the product or components remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges 

our contracts with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer as applicable may accept purchase orders from us these contracts do not represent longterm commitments 

we also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical component supplies the majority of this inventory is production components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand 

some of our custom components such as asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs 

by working collaboratively with our suppliers we endeavor to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and throughout our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted a business partner code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers one element of our business partner code of conduct is adoption and compliance with the responsible business alliance code of conduct the responsible business alliance a coalition of electronics retail auto and toy companies provides guidelines and resources to drive performance and compliance with critical corporate social responsibility policies its goals are to promote ethical business practices to ensure that working conditions in the electronic industry supply chain are safe that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible by using standard audit and assessment protocols and tools we measure and monitor manufacturing partners’ and direct material suppliers’ compliance to the codes of conduct including but not limited to onsite audits risk assessments cdp climate change and water requests and conflict minerals surveys cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies can report their environmental performance on climate change water and forest programs to institutional investors and customers our corporate citizenship and sustainability report and business partner code of conduct are available on our website 

 11 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements either with our distributors resellers or customers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  our total product backlog was approximately 4007 million  and 4412 million  respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers generally within the next six months and excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sellthrough to endusers backlog also excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts 

seasonality 

we as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns historically we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

competition 

we compete in the network infrastructure markets these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer agility advantages in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc or cisco has historically been the dominant player however our principal competitors also include arista networks inc or arista dell inc or dell hewlett packard enterprise co or hpe huawei technologies co ltd or huawei and nokia corporation or nokia 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco nokia hpe and huawei among others have broader portfolios which enable them to bundle their networking products with other networking and information technology products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition marketing budgets and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

in addition there are a number of other competitors in the security network infrastructure space including palo alto networks inc or palo alto networks check point software technologies ltd or check point f5 networks inc or f5 networks and fortinet inc or fortinet among others who tend to be focused specifically on security solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line 

we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco nokia and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that aim to build products with greater capabilities to compete with our products further there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue which may increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios 

in addition to established competitors a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior and cost effective in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have and also from emerging companies that are developing new technologies although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

 12 

environment   

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment or weee directive directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment or rohs and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals or reach regulations adopted by the european union and china to date compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however see the risk factor entitled regulation of our industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects in the section entitled risk factors  in item 1a of part i of this report for additional information concerning regulatory compliance 

juniper’s greatest impact on the environment is through our products and services juniper has an environmental program based on our new product introduction process that focuses on energy efficiency materials innovation and recyclability we consider opportunities to minimize resource impacts and improve efficiencies over a product’s life cycle from the materials we use and a product’s energy footprint to packaging and endoflife or eol activities such as reuse refurbishment and recycling 

we are committed to the environment through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput of key elements in our highperformance network product offerings our products are independently tested by third parties for energy efficiency compliance as an example our mx series 3d universal edge routers offer breakthrough energy efficiency with the mx10003 delivering ultrahigh density in a space and poweroptimized package while consuming 08w per gigabit of throughput additionally we have redesigned packaging in ways that optimizes costs while minimizing resource impacts 

we are also voluntarily participating in cdp climate change and water disclosures and encourage our direct material suppliers representing an aggregate of at least 80 of our consolidated total direct expenditure and 100 of our manufacturing partners to do the same additionally we are a member of the responsible business alliance or rba and have adopted and promote the adoption by our suppliers of the practices of the rba code of conduct as discussed above in the section entitled manufacturing and operations  we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to execute on monitor and drive environmental improvements in our global operations and within our supply chain 

intellectual property   

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products and from time to time we need to renegotiate these licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2017  we had over 3300 patents worldwide and numerous patent applications are pending patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

 13 

employees   

as of december 31 2017  we had 9381 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

investments in our securities involve significant risks even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered in the past significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors disclosed by us including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our business operating results and stock price 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

the factors that may cause our quarterly results to vary quarter by quarter and be unpredictable include but are not limited to 

 

for example we and many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending particularly in the first quarter in addition while we may have backlog orders for products that have not shipped we believe that our backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results for a number of reasons including project delays changes in project scope and the fact that our customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty furthermore market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products rebates and discounting increased component or logistics costs issues with product quality regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations such adjustments may be difficult or impossible to execute in the short or medium term 

as a result of these factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be in the past our operating results have been below our guidance our longterm financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors and this may happen in the future in which case the price of our common stock may decline and has declined in the past such a decline could also occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance

we expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time and the level of gross margins and operating margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable 

we expect our product and service gross margins to vary both in the nearterm and in the longterm and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors some of which have occurred and may occur in the future including customer vertical product and geographic mix shifts an increase or decrease in our software sales or services we provide increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete changes in the actions of our competitors or their pricing strategies which may be difficult to predict and respond to modifications to our pricing strategy in order to gain footprint in certain markets or with certain customers currency fluctuations that impact our costs or the cost of our products and services to our customers increases in material labor logistics warranty costs or inventory carrying costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers issues with manufacturing or component quality or efficiencies increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inaccurately forecasting product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products and enhancements or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures for example in fiscal year 2017 our margins decreased as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower product net revenues and product mix resulting from the yearoveryear decline in routing revenues our customers architectural shifts and higher costs of certain memory components in fiscal year 2016 our margins decreased compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to elevated pricing pressure and product mix in fiscal year 2015 our margins increased compared to fiscal year 2014 as a result of higher restructuring and other charges recorded in 2014 but not in 2015 in connection with the restructuring plan we initiated in the first quarter of 2014 failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

further we will continue to remain diligent in our longterm financial objective to increase revenue and operating margins and manage our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue we expect that our margins will vary with our ability to achieve these goals we can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve all or any of the goals of these plans or meet our announced expectations in whole or in part or that our plans will have the intended effect of improving our margins on the expected timeline or at all 

a limited number of our customers comprise a material portion of our revenues and any changes in the way they purchase products and services from us could affect our business in addition there is an ongoing trend toward consolidation in the industry in which our customers and partners operate any decrease in revenues from our customers or partners could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

a material portion of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners particularly in our telecomcable and cloud verticals changes in the business requirements or focus vendor selection project prioritization financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior including product mix purchased or delays in deployment of our key customers could significantly decrease our sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in recent years there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example centurylink incs acquisition of level 3 communications inc and vodafone india’s proposed acquisition of idea cellular ltd and that consolidation trend has continued certain telecommunications companies have also announced their intent towards vertical consolidation through acquisitions of media and content companies such as verizon’s acquisition of yahoo and att’s proposed acquisition of time warner if our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay suspend or indefinitely reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or other direct or indirect unforeseen consequences could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the buildout of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when our customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the software and equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure for example in the second half of 2017 our switching and routing results were adversely affected by spending delays from our largest cloud customers who we believe are in the process of implementing a networking architectural shift the duration of the delay is difficult to predict in part because each cloud customer will migrate their network architecture based on their own constraints such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or uncertainty customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses in addition economic instability or uncertainty as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world have and may continue to put pressure on economic conditions which has led and could lead to reduced demand for our products to delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects andor higher costs of production more generallyspeaking economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore instability in the global markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the short and medium term therefore fluctuations in revenue and gross margins could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margins from quarter to quarter uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions 

from time to time we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount acquiring companies and increasing our investment in rd sales and marketing and other parts of our business conversely in february 2017 we initiated the 2017 restructuring plan to realign our workforce and increase operational efficiencies this included workforce reductions and contract terminations as we assessed the performance of our operating results against our longterm operating goals and evaluated potential opportunities for improvement the 2017 restructuring plan was expanded and additional restructuring charges were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 to further align our workforce some of our expenses are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the 

 18 

expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competition is intense in the markets that we serve the routing and switching markets have historically been dominated by cisco with competition coming from other companies such as nokia corporation following its acquisition of alcatellucent arista hpe and huawei in the security market we face intense competition from cisco and palo alto networks as well as companies such as check point f5 networks and fortinet further a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition by or of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all for example in recent years nokia corporation merged with alcatellucent hpe acquired aruba networks cisco acquired appdynamics symantec corporation acquired blue coat systems and dell acquired emc which further consolidated our market a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do in addition some of our competitors have become more integrated including through consolidation and offer a broader range of products and services which could make their solutions more attractive to our customers many of our competitors sell networking products as bundled solutions with other it products such as computer and storage systems if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our partners and resellers generally sell or resell competing products on a nonexclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete which could also adversely affect our business 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

a customers decision to purchase certain of our products particularly new products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times both of which may be exacerbated by the impact of global economic weakness may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

the timing of product orders andor our reliance on revenue from sales of software or subscriptions and professional support and maintenance services may cause us to recognize revenue in a different period than the one in which a transaction takes place this may make it difficult for investors to observe quarterly trends and may cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin on a quarterly basis 

generally our network equipment products are stocked only in limited quantities by our distributors and resellers due to the cost complexity and custom nature of configurations required by our customers we generally build such products as orders are received the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter remains unpredictable if orders for certain products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter 

in addition services revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue comprising 31  29  and 27  of total revenue in fiscal year 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively sales of new or renewal professional services support and maintenance contracts may decline andor fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services or those offered by our competitors and reductions in our endcustomers’ 

 19 

spending levels we recognize professional services support and maintenance revenue periodically over the term of the relevant service period 

the introduction of new software products and services is part of our intended strategy to expand our software business and certain software revenues may be recognized periodically over the term of the relevant use period or subscription period as a result certain software subscription and support and maintenance revenue we report each fiscal quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters consequently a decline in such new or renewed contracts in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our software subscriptions or support and maintenance is not reflected in full in our operating results until future periods also it is difficult for us to rapidly increase such software or services revenue through additional sales in any period as revenue from those software subscription and support and maintenance contracts must be recognized over the applicable period 

additionally we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and technology roadmap and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products product enhancements and business strategies that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available or strategies are not executed in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements continuous pricing pressures and a constantly evolving industry we may not be able to anticipate future technological shifts market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet such technological shifts needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all for example the move from traditional wide area network or wan infrastructures towards softwaredefined wan or sdwan has been receiving considerable attention in our view it will take several years to see the full impact of sdwan and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine hardware and software elements if we fail to anticipate market requirements or opportunities or fail to develop and introduce new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we invest time energy and resources in developing products for a market that doesnt develop it could likewise significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products enhancements or business strategies there can be no assurance that new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

in the recent years we have announced a number of new products and enhancements to our hardware and software products across routing switching and security the success of our new products depends on several factors including but not limited to component costs timely completion and introduction of these products prompt resolution of any defects or bugs in these products our ability to support these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

the introduction of new software products is part of our intended strategy to expand our software business we have also begun to disaggregate certain software from certain hardware products such that customers would be able to purchase or license our hardware and software products independently which we expect could in time enable our hardware to be deployed with third party networking applications and services and our software to be used with third party hardware the success of our strategy to expand our software business including our strategy to disaggregate software from certain hardware products is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

 

 

 20 

 

 

 

if any of our new products or business strategies do not gain market acceptance or meet our expectations for growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected and our competitive position and our business and financial results could be harmed 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to or disruptions in those relationships or manufacturing processes expected or unexpected may result in delays that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships which includes failing to provide accurate forecasts of our requirements or if one or more of them experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future an increase in the expected time required to manufacture our products or ship products such delays could result in supply shortfalls that damage our ability to meet customer demand for those products and could cause our customers to purchase alternative products from our competitors also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers or the introduction of new products by us would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other foreign countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states including the possibility of import tariffs or regional conflicts each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

we provide demand forecasts for our products to our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our original design or contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins for example in certain prior quarters our gross margins were reduced as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand in addition some optical modules we use are experiencing faster product transitions than our other products which increases the risk that we could have excess inventory of those modules conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time and because our contract manufacturers are thirdparty manufacturers for numerous other companies if we underestimate our requirements as we have in certain prior quarters with respect to certain products our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products which could increase costs or delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues and negatively impacting customer satisfaction 

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our and our customers’ proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy the growing cyber risk environment means that individuals companies and organizations of all sizes including juniper have been and are increasingly subject to the threat of intrusions on their networks and systems by a wide range of actors on an ongoing and regular basis despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure has experienced breaches and may 

 21 

be vulnerable in the future to breach or attacks by computer programmers hackers or sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors or breached due to employee error or wrongful conduct malfeasance or other disruptions if any breach or attack compromises our networks creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost or stolen and we may be subject to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and suffer reputational and financial harm in addition hardware components and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks or expose us or our products to cyber attacks this can be true even for “legacy” products that have been determined to have reached an end of life engineering status but will continue to operate for a limited amount of time 

when vulnerabilities are discovered we evaluate the risk apply patches or take other remediation actions as required and notify customers and suppliers when appropriate all of this requires significant time and attention from management and our employees 

as a result of any actual or perceived breach of network security that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products and our overall reputation could be harmed as a large well known provider of networking products cyber attackers may specifically target our products or attempt to imitate us or our products in order to compromise a network because the techniques used by attackers many of whom are highly sophisticated and wellfunded to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques or the vulnerabilities they have caused this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions which could have an adverse impact on our financial results the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the attacker which are often difficult to pinpoint additionally we could be subject to regulatory investigations potential fines and litigation in connection with a security breach or related issue and be liable to third parties for these types of breaches 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages quality issues or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

we rely on single or limited sources of certain of our components during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited for example some optical transceivers and memory components used in our networking solutions might experience extended lead times and higher pricing given the demand in the market any future spike in growth in our business or more likely in it spending and the economy in general is likely to create greater shortterm pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed in addition we have experienced and from timetotime may experience component shortages or quality issues that resulted or could result in delays of product shipments andor warranty or other claims for example in late 2016 we became aware of a defect in a clocksignal component from a thirdparty supplier that affected certain of our products and which resulted in remediation costs as a result of this issue we recorded a product cost of revenue charge that impacted our product gross margins for our fiscal year ended december 31 2016 and three months ended march 31 2017 and we may incur additional costs we also currently purchase numerous key components including asics and other semiconductor chips from single or limited sources and many of our component suppliers are concentrated in china and korea in addition there has been consolidation among certain suppliers of our components for example globalfoundries acquired ibm’s semiconductor manufacturing business avago technologies limited acquired broadcom corporation intel corporation acquired altera corporation and broadcom limited is proposing to acquire qualcomm incorporated consolidation among suppliers can result in the reduction of the number of independent suppliers of components available to us which could negatively impact our ability to access certain component parts or the prices we have to pay for such parts in addition our suppliers may determine not to continue a business relationship with us for other reasons that may be beyond our control any disruptions to our supply chain could decrease our sales earnings and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to increases in wages that drive up prices the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes on key components labor stoppages transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters civil unrest military conflicts geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services 

 22 

the development of alternate sources for key components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules also longterm supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may further increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

we rely on valueadded and other resellers as well as distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded and other reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm dimension data and nec corporation the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products and some of which sell their own competing products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues for example in 2016 nokia corporation merged with alcatellucent a competitor of ours and in 2015 cisco announced a partnership with ericsson which is one of our existing partners our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets fail to expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively determine that we cannot continue to do business with these partners for any reason or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

we are also vulnerable to third parties who illegally distribute or sell counterfeit stolen or unfit versions of our products which has happened in the past and could happen in the future such sales could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and scale and improve our processes and procedures that support the channel as a result our programs processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage we have previously entered into oem agreements with partners pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the programs processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products we also depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers data center providers or other partners as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology or it systems the systems and processes of third parties and the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties for example we are in the process of further consolidating our onsite data centers to the cloud and to offsite facilities that are hosted and controlled by thirdparties these cloud providers and offsite facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures equipment failure adverse events caused by operator error and similar events in addition 

 23 

because we lease our cloud storage space and offsite data center facilities we cannot be assured that we will be able to expand our data center infrastructure to meet user demand in a timely manner or on favorable economic terms if we have issues receiving and processing data this may delay our ability to provide products and services to our customers and damage our business we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturers were not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us which prevented us from meeting our commitments to our customers if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business for example in 2017 we acquired cyphort inc and in 2016 we acquired appformix inc aurrion inc and bti systems inc acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs and liabilities diversion of managements attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired business if we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders use a substantial portion of our cash resources assume liabilities record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies and our other large customers generally require onerous terms and conditions in our contracts with them as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies which comprise a significant portion of our customer base and other large companies generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and accordingly often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers for example our customers france telecomorange and deutsche telekom ag have formed a company for the purpose of purchasing products from and negotiating more favorable contractual terms with suppliers as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

in addition service providers have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased patent litigation brought against customers by nonpracticing entities in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in customers requesting or requiring vendors to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 24 

we are a party to lawsuits investigations proceedings and other disputes which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay fines or damages undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors have been or are subject to various lawsuits we have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters commercial transactions and patent infringement as well as securities laws as noted in note 16 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this report under the heading of “legal proceedings” the us securities and exchange commission or the sec is conducting and the us department of justice or the doj was previously conducting investigations into possible violations by the company of the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa in a number of countries the investigations relate to certain of the company’s marketing practices and whether the company or any third party on behalf of the company gave anything of value to any government official in violation of the fcpa the company’s audit committee with the assistance of independent advisors has been investigating and conducting a thorough review of possible violations of the fcpa and has made recommendations for remedial measures including employee disciplinary actions in foreign jurisdictions which the company has implemented and continues to implement litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain we therefore cannot predict the duration scope outcome or consequences of litigation and government investigations in connection with any government investigations including those in which we are currently involved as described above if the government takes action against us or we agree to settle the matter we may be required to pay substantial fines and incur other sanctions which may be material and suffer reputational harm the lawsuits and investigations are expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights resolution of which may be timeconsuming and expensive as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights in addition increased patent litigation brought by nonpracticing entities in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in our customers requesting or requiring us to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies enter into license agreements or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us or anyone we are required to indemnify by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money if we fail to develop noninfringing technology if we incorporate infringing technology in our products or if we license required proprietary rights at material expense our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

regulation of our industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects 

we are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas for example some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria even though those criteria may be in conflict with accepted international standards other regulations that may negatively impact our business include country of origin regulations these types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements applicable to public companies regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries which we refer to collectively as the drc and procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals” these minerals are present in our products in addition the european union reached agreement in late 2016 on a euwide conflict minerals rule under which most eu importers of tin tungsten tantalum gold and their ores will have to conduct due diligence to 

 25 

ensure the minerals do not originate from conflict zones and do not fund armed conflicts large manufacturers also will have to disclose how they plan to monitor their sources to comply with the rules the regulation was adopted in 2017 with compliance required by 2021 

in addition environmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment may adversely impact our business and financial condition these laws and regulations include among others the european union or eu restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive or rohs the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in electronic equipment including our products currently our products comply with the eu rohs requirements however certain exemptions are scheduled to lapse or have lapsed the lapse of any exemption further changes to this or other laws or passage of similar laws in the eu or other jurisdictions would require us to cease selling noncompliant products in the eu and to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us disrupt our operations or logistics and result in an adverse impact on our operating results in addition in validating the compliance of our products with applicable hazardous materials restrictions we rely substantially on affirmations by our component suppliers as to the compliance of their products with respect to those same restrictions failure by our component suppliers to furnish accurate and timely information could subject us to penalties or liability for violation of such hazardous materials restrictions interrupt our supply of products to the eu and result in our customers refusing or being unable to purchase our products additionally the eu and a number of other countries have adopted regulations requiring producers of electrical and electronic equipment to assume certain responsibilities for collecting treating recycling and disposing of products when they have reached the end of their useful life finally the eu reach regulations regulate the handling of certain chemical substances that may be used in our products 

in addition as a contractor and subcontractor to us government departments and agencies we are subject to federal regulations pertaining to our it systems for instance as a subcontractor to the us department of defense or dod the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars required that our it systems comply with the security and privacy controls described in national institute of standards and technology special publication 800171 or nist sp 800171 no later than december 31 2017 the dfars also requires that we flow the security control requirement down to certain of our own subcontractors failure to comply with these requirements could result in a loss of federal government business subject us to claims or other remedies for noncompliance and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the internet telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks but future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the internet and internet service provider access charges we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service providers or cloud provider companies regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers needs for products for instance in december 2017 the us federal communications commission repealed its 2015 regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks this change in regulatory treatment of networks might impact service provider and cloud provider business models and as such providers needs for internet telecommunications equipment and services also many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security supply chain integrity privacy and data protection any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment 

the adoption and implementation of additional regulations could reduce demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products result in product inventory writeoffs impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner require us to spend significant time and expense to comply and subject us to fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 26 

governmental regulations and economic sanctions affecting the import or export of products generally or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls and restrictions on the import or export of among other things products that contain or use encryption technology most of our products contain or use encryption technology and consequently are subject to such controls requirements and restrictions certain governments also control importation and incountry use of encryption items and technology the scope nature and severity of such controls vary widely across different countries and may change frequently over time for example china has promulgated cybersecurity regulations and published a new draft export law affecting networking products that may impair our ability to profitably market and sell our products in china certain countries’ encryption control regimes may significantly limit our ability to sell major lines of our products in those countries 

certain governments also impose special local content certification testing source code review escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys or feature requirements on network equipment for purposes of government procurements similar requirements may also be imposed in procurements by state owned entities “soe’s” our ability to sell into substantial government and soe markets whether or not the products we sell include encryption is vulnerable to changes in applicable government procurement regulations any associated local content requirements and changes in the government’s interpretation of such regulations in addition the us government has broader sanctions and embargoes that generally forbid supply of most items to or involving certain countries territories governments legal entities and individuals including restrictions imposed by the us and eu on exports to russia and ukraine we have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into these countries or to prohibited entities or individuals but there can be no assurance that they will always be effective 

governmental regulation of encryption or ip networking technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or related economic sanctions could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues and operating results in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in harm to our reputation and ability to compete in international markets penalties costs seizure of assets including source code and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or governmentfunded projects 

our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a variety of state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these privacy and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development and offering of new products and services 

for example we previously relied upon adherence to the us department of commerce’s safe harbor privacy principles and compliance with the useu safe harbor framework which we refer to as the safe harbor agreed to by the us department of commerce and the eu the safe harbor which established means for legitimizing the transfer of personal data by us companies from the european economic area or eea to the us was invalidated in 2015 by a decision of the european court of justice or the ecj now that the eu and us have implemented a successor privacy framework called the privacy shield we are reviewing and documenting our practices required to obtain certification under the privacy shield in addition to entering into eu model contracts with our vendors where appropriate and feasible in anticipation of the possibility that either the privacy shield or eu model contracts may be legally challenged or voided like safe harbor in an uncertain political environment in addition the eu general data protection regulation which goes into full effect in may 2018 is expected to result in substantial changes to our compliance obligations including contractual requirements for data transfers outside the eea and a significant increase in potential administrative fines for noncompliance similarly the june 2016 approval by voters in the united kingdom or uk of a referendum to leave the eu could require us to make additional changes to the way we conduct our business and transmit data between the us uk eu and the rest of the world 

our actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect personal data could result in enforcement actions significant penalties or other legal action against us or our customers or suppliers which could result in negative publicity increase our operating costs subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 27 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people with specialized industry expertise is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

a number of our team members are foreign nationals who rely on visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the united states and other countries in recent years the united states has increased the level of scrutiny in granting h1b l1 and other business visas in addition the current us administration has indicated that immigration reform is a priority compliance with united states immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals any of these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

we are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill annually or more frequently if certain circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible assets below their carrying values as of december 31 2017  our goodwill was 30962 million  and intangible assets with indefinite lives was 490 million  when the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill or if the carrying amount of an intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value a charge to operations is recorded either event would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred 

in the past we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million due to the underperformance of our security reporting unit and product rationalizations 

from time to time economic weakness has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours declines in our level of revenues or declines in our operating margins or sustained declines in our stock price increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives may become impaired in future periods 

during the three months ended june 30 2017 we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis on our security reporting unit based on our analysis we determined that our security reporting unit’s goodwill was not impaired however our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis such as expected future cash flows the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets and our stock price if the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets however any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by the following earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement costs related to intercompany restructuring tax effects of sharebased compensation challenges to our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” which was signed into law on december 22 2017 makes significant changes to the taxation of us business entities that will have a meaningful impact to our provision for income taxes these changes include a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate the current taxation of certain foreign earnings the imposition of baseerosion prevention measures which may limit the deduction of certain transfer pricing payments and possible limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or corporate debt obligations accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act requires significant 

 28 

judgements and estimates that are based on current interpretations of the tax act and could be affected by changing interpretations of the act as well as additional legislation and guidance around the act any refinements to these provisional estimates are difficult to predict and could impact our results 

furthermore on october 5 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development or oecd an international association of 35 countries including the us published final proposals under its base erosion and profit shifting or beps action plan the beps action plan includes fifteen actions to address beps in a comprehensive manner and represents a significant change to the international corporate tax landscape these proposals as adopted by countries may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service or irs and other tax authorities it is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes but the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made there can be no assurance that the outcomes from continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our ability to compete 

we generally rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology any of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings and other competitive harm 

in addition despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that the agreements we have entered into will not be breached we cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 

furthermore the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and vars in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the united states in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic business regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including the following 

 

 

 29 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the june 2016 approval by voters in the uk of a referendum to leave the eu and the uk’s formal initiation of the exit process in march 2017 commonly referred to as brexit has caused and may continue to cause uncertainty in the global markets the uk’s exit from the eu if implemented   will take some period of time to complete and could result in regulatory changes that impact our business for example changes to the way service providers conduct business and transmit data between the uk and the eu could require us to make changes to the way we handle customer data we will also review the impact of any resulting changes to eu or uk law that could affect our operations such as labor policies financial planning product manufacturing and product distribution political and regulatory responses to the vote are still developing and we are in the process of assessing the impact the vote may have on our business as more information becomes available nevertheless because we conduct business in the eu including the uk any of the effects of brexit including those we cannot anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the united states or in other countries in which we operate in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors channel partners and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in termination of our relationship financial reporting problems fines andor penalties for us or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected defects errors or malware or do not meet customer quality expectations our business could be adversely affected and we may be subject to additional costs or lawsuits or be required to pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities these errors may arise from hardware or software we produce or procure from third parties some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers for example in december 2015 we disclosed that we identified unauthorized code in screenos that could allow a knowledgeable attacker to gain administrative access to netscreen devices and to decrypt vpn connections 

any errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in monetary penalties negative publicity loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and 

 30 

reputation penalties and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition in the event an error defect malware or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty or indemnification defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed moreover if our products fail to satisfy our customers quality expectations for whatever reason the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

because a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound chinese yuan euro and indian rupee related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars this could negatively affect our ability to meet our customers pricing expectations in those markets and may result in erosion of gross margin and market share a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows with the aim of offsetting the impact of currency fluctuations on these exposures however hedge activities can be costly and hedging cannot fully offset all risks including longterm declines or appreciation in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines or appreciation in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

a portion of the transaction consideration we received from the divestiture of our junos pulse product portfolio is in the form of a noncontingent seller promissory note and we may not receive the amount owed to us including accrued interest including in the time frame contemplated by the buyer under the note 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed the sale of our junos pulse product portfolio to an affiliate of siris capital a private equity firm for total consideration of 2307 million of which 1250 million was in the form of an 18month noncontingent interestbearing promissory note issued to the company on october 2 2015 we and the issuer of the promissory note agreed to modify the original terms of the note to extend the maturity date from april 1 2016 to december 31 2018 on may 1 2017 we received a principal payment in the amount of 750 million and outstanding interest on the note and we and the issuer agreed to further amend the terms of the note with respect to the remaining approximately 580 million to among other things extend the maturity date from december 31 2018 to september 30 2022 provide that interest due can be paid in kind by increasing the outstanding principal amount of the note and subordinate the note to other debt issued by senior lenders since a portion of the transaction consideration is in the form of a noncontingent seller promissory note and the note is subordinated to debt issued by senior lenders there is the risk that we may not receive the amount owed to us including accrued interest including in the time frame contemplated under the note in the event that the promissory note is not repaid on the terms we contemplate any collection or restructuring efforts we undertake may be costly and require significant time and attention from our management and there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover the amounts owed to us in full 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to effectively improve our systems and processes or we fail to monitor and ensure that these systems and processes are being used correctly our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

 31 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or are not available on terms acceptable to us our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to renegotiate our current third party licenses or license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the failure to comply with the terms of any license including free open source software may result in our inability to continue to use such license some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them in addition we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products third party technology we incorporate into our products that is deemed to infringe on the intellectual property of others may result and in some cases has resulted in limitations on our ability to source technology from those third parties restrictions on our ability to sell products that incorporate the infringing technology increased exposure to liability that we will be held responsible for incorporating the infringing technology in our products and increased costs involved in removing that technology from our products or developing substitute technology our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us if possible to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and publicly disclose material weaknesses in our controls any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception and our stock price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness or significant deficiency investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major credit rating agencies routinely evaluate our indebtedness this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

 32 

we may be unable to generate the cash flow to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our debt obligations including the notes and the revolving credit facility 

as of december 31 2017  we have issued 21500 million  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes which we refer to collectively as the notes and had 21363 million  in outstanding longterm debt see discussion in note 10 debt and financing  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report in june 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year 5000 million  unsecured revolving credit facility which we refer to as the revolving credit facility with an option to increase the revolving credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million  the credit agreement will terminate in june 2019 at which point all amounts borrowed must be repaid as of december 31 2017  no amounts were outstanding under the credit agreement 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon our ability to pay our expenses satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance which will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control based upon current levels of operations we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon however if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt we may be required to sell assets reduce capital expenditures refinance all or a portion of our existing debt including the notes or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the indentures that govern the notes contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

the credit agreement contains two financial covenants along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following 

 

 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business a failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default in addition in the event of an acceleration we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments including those under the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon 

in addition certain changes under the tax act may result in limitations on the deductibility of our net business interest expenses beginning in 2018 the tax act generally limits the annual deduction for net business interest expense to an amount equal to 30 of adjusted taxable income as a result if our taxable income were to decline we may not be able to fully deduct our net interest expense these changes among others under the tax act could result in increases to our future us tax expenses which could have a material impact on our business 

 33 

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends or achieve our intended capital return policy will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital and debt service requirements use of cash for acquisitions and other factors any failure to pay or increase future dividends as announced or a reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we announced that beginning in 2017 we intend to target a capital return policy inclusive of share repurchases and dividends of approximately 50 of annual free cash flow free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures in january 2018 we announced that our board of directors approved a new 2 billion buyback authorization which replaced our prior authorization in february 2018 as a part of our new buyback authorization we entered into a 750 million accelerated share repurchase program in addition our board of directors declared an increase to our quarterly cash dividend to 018 per share which reflects an increase of 80 compared to previous quarterly dividends any failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis in addition our insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future

the following discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item 8 of part ii of this report 

the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap in the course of operating our business we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices the collection of receivables the manufacturing and shipment of products the fulfillment of orders the purchase of supplies and the building of inventory and spare parts among other matters in making these decisions we consider various factors including contractual obligations customer satisfaction competition internal and external financial targets and expectations and financial planning objectives each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period for further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates see “critical accounting policies and estimates” section included in this “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report we have provided an executive overview which includes a summary of our business and market environment along with a financial results and key performance metrics overview these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item 7 our “risk factors” section included in item 1a of part i and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 of part ii of this report 

executive overview 

business and market environment 

juniper designs develops and sells products and services for highperformance networks to enable customers to build scalable reliable secure and costeffective networks for their businesses while achieving agility efficiency and value through automation 

our products are sold in three geographic regions americas europe middle east and africa or emea and asia pacific or apac we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings across routing switching and security technologies in addition to our products we offer our customers services including maintenance and support professional services and education and training programs we believe our silicon systems and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking helping our customers achieve superior performance greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership 

further our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operation of networks and to allow our customers across our key verticals to deliver further value over their networks we anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue over time 

in 2017 we began reporting revenue on the following verticals cloud telecomcable and strategic enterprise which we believe better aligns with our business model compared to our previous reporting of revenue by service provider and enterprise a summary of the types of customers included in our verticals is as follows 

 

 

 

we are focused on and continue to see significant opportunities from the implementation of cloud architectures such as large public and private data centers as well as distributed cloud infrastructure which resides in multiple distributed data centers in order to place applications or services closer to end users such as enabling security and networking as a service 

 41 

we believe the network needs for our customers in our telecomcable and cloud verticals are converging as are those of strategic enterprises as all of these customers recognize the need for high performance networks and leveraging the cloud for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency 

as these customers continue to grow we believe their network architectures will continue to evolve we believe our understanding of high performance networking technology and our strategy position us to capitalize on the industry transition to more automated costefficient scalable networks 

in routing we believe that certain large cloud customers are starting to transition their wide area networks from scaleup to a scaleout architecture as they continue to add capacity which has resulted and we expect may continue to result in a transition of these customers from purchasing our mx product family to our ptx product family these architectural shifts have led to a nearterm slowdown in our net revenues as in some cases there is a pause before the new architecture ramps as well as lower average selling prices for ptx product family compared to mx product family we are unable to predict the exact timing or duration of the transition as it will vary from customer to customer 

in switching we see that certain large cloud customers who can rapidly scale based on increased demand are in the process of adopting 100gigabit connections or 100g resulting in certain large deployment delays at our largest cloud customers as they prepare for this adoption 

despite these ongoing deployment delays and architectural shifts we remain confident in our competitive position and strong relationships with these strategic customers our overall strategy with our cloud customers has not changed and we continue to execute against our innovation roadmap which includes our plan to continue to grow our relevance and our business in the cloud vertical 

in 2017 we continued to execute on our product strategy specifically around the cloud we announced cloudgrade networking which we expect will accelerate agility and innovation with cloud customers cloudgrade networking builds on carriergrade reach and reliability with enterprisegrade control and usability bringing cloudlevel agility and operational scale to networks everywhere this announcement included two new foundational products 

 aligning with our cloudgrade networking initiative we also announced a programmable photonic layer solution comprised of two main products tcx1000 series programmable roadm and pronx optical director this solution is a disaggregated optical line system that is designed to offer greater levels of flexibility cost control and multilayer visibility to packetoptical transport 

we also announced enhancements to our softwaredefined secure networks or sdsn platform and expanded our public cloud offering with the introduction of vsrx for microsoft azure our sdsn enhancements deliver pervasive security across multivendor environments public clouds and private clouds further we announced enhancements to our contrail cloud platform that includes appformix integrations prevalidated virtual network functions and a managed solution of professional services offering to simplify our customers transition to telco clouds 

in addition we announced further cloudbased enhancements to our security portfolio we introduced our contrail security product a new solution specifically designed to allow enterprises and softwareasaservice or saas cloud providers to protect applications running in multiple cloud environments we also completed the acquisition of cyphort inc a software company that provides security analytics for advanced threat defense this acquisition is expected to strengthen the capabilities of our cloudbased threat prevention service sky advanced threat prevention or sky atp by increasing efficiency and performance and providing additional threat detection functionalities and analytics we will continue to look at targeted and strategic acquisitions that we believe can complement our product portfolio operations rd strategy or overall business

critical accounting policies and estimates   

the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer liabilities assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our significant accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

 

goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recorded the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of november 1 st  or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment level by comparing the reporting units carrying value including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating results of the component 

the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test various factors are considered in the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions financial performance or a sustained decrease in share price if as a result of the qualitative assessment it is deemed more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount management will perform the quantitative test 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test if necessary involves a twostep process to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the first step tests for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units with the reporting unit’s carrying values if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting units does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the 

 44 

reporting unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the second step requires an assignment of the reporting unit’s fair value to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities using the relevant acquisition accounting guidance to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill and if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

in the first step the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using both the income and market valuation approaches we believe the income approach and the market approach are equally representative of the reporting unit’s fair value under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publiclytraded companies in similar lines of business in the application of the income and market valuation approaches we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units and then apply a control premium which is determined by considering control premiums offered as part of the acquisitions that have occurred in market segments that are comparable with our reporting units the income approach and the market approach are equally weighted to derive the fair value of the reporting unit 

in the second step the reporting units fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets such as existing technology backlog and customer relationships in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates customer renewal rates and technology obsolescence rates used in valuing intangible assets and pricing of comparable transactions in the market in valuing the tangible assets 

during the second quarter of 2017 we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis on our security reporting unit based on our analysis we determined that our security reporting unit’s goodwill was not impaired 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we performed a qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units routing switching and security this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value we considered macroeconomic factors including the economic growth general macroeconomic trends and growth for the markets in which the reporting units operate changes in the industry environment and the performance of market competitors in addition to these macroeconomic factors we considered the reporting units’ current results and forecasts any changes in the nature of the business any changes in cost factors any significant legal regulatory contractual or other business factors and changes in the carrying values as a result of our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that our goodwill was not impaired and we did not perform a quantitative assessment

we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  our contract manufacturer liabilities were 220 million  and 140 million respectively 

significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory and obsolete material exposures we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and contract manufacturer liabilities which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 

 

under our revenue recognition policies we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe if available thirdparty evidence or tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles when determining esp we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years 

 

we have accounted for the tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act which we refer to as the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 on a provisional basis our accounting for certain income tax effects is incomplete but we have determined reasonable estimates for those effects our reasonable estimates are included in our financial statements 

 46 

as of december 31 2017 we expect to complete our accounting during the one year measurement period from the enactment date 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules in addition the oecd’s recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles as adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

results of operations 

the following table presents net revenues by product and service customer vertical and geographic region in millions except percentages 



2017  compared to 2016   

product net revenues decreased  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to a decrease in routing and to a lesser extent security partially offset by growth in switching 

lower routing revenues was driven by cloud customers in the americas as a result of the ongoing architectural shifts in the cloud vertical to more automated cost efficient and scalable networks routing revenues in emea also declined yearoveryear due to lower sales from telecomcable customers partially offset by revenue growth in apac from our telecomcable vertical as we continue to expand our footprint with certain strategic apac telecom and cloud customers particularly in australia we expect these strategic opportunities will ultimately help to drive revenue growth in apac revenues from our mx and legacy routing products declined yearoveryear which was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our ptx products from the continued adoption of our ptx1000 series of products we are expecting a yearoveryear revenue decline in our routing business in 2018 as a result of the ongoing architectural shifts in the cloud vertical 

security net revenues declined in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by a decrease in our highend srx series as it has been undergoing a product refresh cycle and the decline in our other legacy products we are expecting a yearoveryear revenue increase in our security business in 2018 as a result of product refresh 

 48 

the decline in product net revenues was partially offset by an increase in switching net revenues due to continued growth from our data center switching portfolio particularly from our qfx product family which grew 25 yearoveryear this growth was across public and private clouds driven in part by 100g adoption the switching net revenue growth was primarily driven by the cloud vertical in the americas and to a lesser extent our strategic enterprise vertical we expect that our data center switching portfolio will continue to drive revenue growth in our switching business and we expect yearoveryear revenue growth in our switching business in 2018 

service net revenues increased during in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts additionally we saw strong yearoveryear services revenue growth in apac and emea 

2016  compared to 2015   

product net revenues decreased slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in security and to a lesser extent routing partially offset by growth in switching 

the decrease in security was driven by our srx products which has been undergoing a product refresh cycle and the continued decline of our screen os and other legacy products we continue to expect that our screen os and other legacy products will not contribute to meaningful security product revenue growth and should continue to decline over time the decrease in security net revenues was driven by our strategic enterprise vertical due to competitive pressures 

routing product net revenues decreased slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decline in revenues from our mx products resulting from lower sales from our telecomcable vertical in the americas and emea which is impacted by the timing of large deployments revenues from our legacy products continued to decline as expected as we continued to transition to our nextgeneration ptx series of products these declines were significantly offset by a strong increase in revenues from our ptx series of products due to higher sales to cloud and telecomcable customers as well as the ramp up of sales of our new products 

the decline in product net revenues was partially offset by an increase in switching primarily due to continued growth from our data center switching portfolio particularly from our qfx product family which increased over 50 yearoveryear driven by the ramp up of sales of our new product offerings as well as an increase in revenues from cloud customers in americas this was partially offset by lower demand for our ex products as we transitioned to our new ex product portfolio we are focused on the growing cloud and data center market and expect our expanded data center switching portfolio will continue to drive revenue growth in our switching business in the foreseeable future 

service net revenues increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by strong attach rates and renewals of support contracts 

customer 

no customer accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



our gross margins as a percentage of net revenues have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the mix and average selling prices of our products and services new product introductions and enhancements manufacturing and component costs expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations cost of support and service personnel customer 

 49 

mix as we continue to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers and certain geographic regions and the mix of distribution channels through which our products and services are sold 

2017  compared to 2016   

product gross margin 

product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower product net revenues customer mix and product mix resulting from the yearoveryear decline in routing revenues and our customers architectural shifts partially offset by improvements in our cost structure in the nearterm we expect product gross margin will continue to be affected by lower revenues and product mix including from our customers architectural shifts we are undertaking specific efforts to address certain factors impacting our product gross margin these efforts include cost reductions performance and quality improvements through engineering to increase value across our products optimizing our supply chain pricing management and increasing software and solution sales however there can be no guarantee that these efforts will be successful or that they will be realized in the time frame we anticipate 

we expect that our product gross margin will continue to vary in the future due to the mix of products sold geographic mix and competitive pricing pressures 

service gross margin 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher service revenues partially offset by higher material and higher delivery costs 

2016  compared to 2015   

product gross margin 

product gross margin decreased  as a percentage of product net revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to elevated pricing pressures product mix and remediation costs of 108 million for certain products containing a defect in a clocksignal component from a thirdparty supplier partially offset by improvements in our cost structure we expect that our product gross margin will continue to vary in the future due to the mix of products sold and competitive pricing pressures 

service gross margin 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in support revenue as well as improvements in labor productivity and logistics partially offset by increased support costs related to the ramp up of new products

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expenses in millions except percentages 



 

nm  percentage is not meaningful 

our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnelrelated costs including salaries and wages commissions and bonuses which we refer to collectively as variable compensation benefits sharebased compensation and travel facility and information technology or it departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount we had a total of 9381 9832 and 9058 employees as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively our headcount decreased by 451 employees or 5 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to our restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2017 to realign our workforce and increase operational efficiency which we refer to as the 2017 restructuring plan our headcount increased by 774 employees or 9 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily in research and development driven by our 2016 business acquisitions as well as higher services and sales headcount as we focus on delivering our new products to our customers 

2017  compared to 2016

research and development expense or rd decreased in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to a decline in personnelrelated costs including lower sharebased compensation of 398 million primarily driven by lower expense from certain performance share awards or psas whose vesting is contingent upon the achievement of financial performance metrics or certain performance milestones and lower variable compensation of 137 million the decrease was partially offset by higher costs related to certain rd project cancellations of 114 million and higher prototype costs of 104 million 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense decreased in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to a decline in personnelrelated costs of 205 million including lower variable compensation of 155 million primarily as a result of lower commissions expense and lower salaries and wages driven by a decrease in headcount as a result of the 2017 restructuring plan 

general and administrative

2017  compared to 2016

during the year ended december 31 2017 we saw an increase from gains on equity investments primarily related to the sale of investments in public and privatelyheld companies in addition we recorded impairment charges on certain investments in privatelyheld companies in 2016 and there were no such charges recorded in 2017 

2016  compared to 2015

income tax provision 

the following table presents the income tax provision in millions except percentages 



2017  compared to 2016   

the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 was higher than 2016 primarily due to an estimated 2895 million  of net income tax expense related to changes imposed by the tax act which was enacted on december 22 2017 effective january 1 2018 the tax act provides for significant changes to us income tax law including the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and the creation of a minimum tax on foreign earnings in addition the tax act imposed a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings through december 31 2017 the 2895 million  income tax expense includes an estimated tax charge of 4312 million  on the company’s accumulated foreign earnings which the company has elected to pay over eight years as described in note 14 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 1 of part i of this report 

we expect the future effective rate to trend toward the newly enacted us statutory rate with the exception of the impacts of stock based compensation and onetime items in addition our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items see item 1a of part ii risk factors of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results 

2016  compared to 2015   

the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2016 was higher than 2015 primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2015 includes a benefit of 132 million  related to a change in the tax treatment of sharebased compensation in our cost sharing arrangement 

as a result of recommendations by the organisation for economic cooperation and development or oecd on base erosion and profit shifting certain countries in emea and apac have either enacted new corporate tax legislation or are considering enacting such legislation in the near future we expect the effect of these reform measures to potentially impact longstanding tax principles particularly as regards to transfer pricing consequently we expect global tax authorities to increasingly challenge the company’s cost sharing and other intercompany arrangements and the related sourcing of taxable profits in global jurisdictions in 2017 discussions were held with tax authorities including uk and australia regarding corporate tax reform legislation enacted by those countries

liquidity and capital resources

summary of cash flows 

the following table summarizes cash flows from our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions except percentages 

 

 

operating activities 

our primary source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnelrelated expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

2017  compared to 2016   

net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in cash collections from customers in the first half of 2017 due to higher invoicing activity during the fourth quarter of 2016 partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers higher payments for restructuring activities and an increase in cash paid for income taxes 

2016  compared to 2015   

net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in cash collections from customers in 2016 due to higher invoicing activity during the fourth quarter of 2015 partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid 

 55 

investing activities   

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases sales maturities and redemptions and cash used for business combinations 

2017  compared to 2016   

net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower payments for business combinations and capital expenditures and the receipt of 750 million in proceeds from the pulse note partially offset by higher net purchases of availableforsale securities 

2016  compared to 2015   

net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease was primary due to a decrease in net purchases of availableforsale investments partially offset by an increase in cash used for business acquisitions in 2016 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock payment of cash dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans 

2017  compared to 2016   

net cash used in financing activities increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of our common stock in 2017 in 2016 we raised 4940 million from our 2019 notes and 2024 notes and repaid 3000 million of our 2016 notes 

2016  compared to 2015   

net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease was primarily due to lower purchases and retirements of our common stock in 2016 partially offset by the payment of our 2016 notes and a decrease in cash proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt and the issuance of common stock in 2016 

capital return 

the following table summarizes our dividends paid and stock repurchase activities in millions except per share amounts 



in 2014 and 2015 our board of directors which we refer to as the board approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to 21 billion  of our common stock including 12 billion  pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program asr and subsequent increases to the authorization totaling 18 billion  stock repurchase program in february 2017 the board authorized a 500 million  increase to the stock repurchase program for a total of 44 billion  as of december 31 2017  we utilized all of the authorized funds under the stock repurchase program 

in january 2018 our board approved a new 20 billion share repurchase authorization 2018 stock repurchase program which replaces the previous authorization our board also authorized us to enter into an asr for an amount up to 750 million under the 2018 stock repurchase program and we expect to be opportunistic with our share repurchases in 2018 

in february 2018 we entered into asr agreements with two financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of 750 million of our common stock the company made an upfront payment of 750 million pursuant to the asr and received and retired an   

 56 

initial 233 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of 6000 million based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the transaction we have an aggregate of 13 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 stock repurchase program as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k 

in addition our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 018 per common stock to be paid on march 22 2018 to stockholders of records as of the close of business on march 1 2018 this reflects an increase of 80 compared to previous quarterly dividends we intend to grow our dividend over time 

future share repurchases under the 2018 stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements our 2018 stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time additionally the declaration and amount of any future cash dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors or an authorized committee thereof and will depend on our financial performance economic outlook and any other relevant considerations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however in the normal course of business we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and insurance programs see guarantees  below for additional information regarding our guarantees 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments debt and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 



 

 

as of december 31 2017  we had 2566 million  included in longterm income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes as a result this amount is not included in the table above 

 57 

revolving credit facility 

as of december 31 2017  we have not borrowed any funds and we were in compliance with all covenants under our unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in 2019 which enables borrowings up to 5000 million  with the option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million  see note 10 debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further information on our credit facility 

guarantees 

we have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products solely or in combination with other third party products infringe the intellectual property rights of a thirdparty as of december 31 2017  we recorded 204 million  for such indemnification obligations in other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets we also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and insurance programs of 230 million  and 60 million  as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions investments in strategic relationships repurchases of additional shares of our common stock and payment of cash dividends on our common stock as of december 31 2017  91 of our cash cash equivalents and investment balances were held outside of the us following the enactment of the tax act we plan to repatriate approximately 30 billion we expect the new territorial tax system to provide us lower cost access to nearly all of our global free cash flow on an ongoing basis free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we intend to use the repatriated cash to invest in the business support valueenhancing merger and acquisitions or ma and fund our return of capital to stockholders 

in august 2016 we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec enabling us to offer for sale from time to time an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions our 2019 notes and 2024 notes were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement that we filed in august 2013 pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the sec on february 24 2016 our 2020 notes and 2025 notes were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the sec on february 26 2015 and our 3500 million in principal amount of our 2024 notes which form a single series and are fully fungible with our 2024 notes issued in 2016 were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to a prospectus filed with the sec on february 28 2014 any offerings of securities under our automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus in addition our revolving credit facility will also provide additional flexibility for future liquidity needs 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations planned stock repurchases and dividends capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including but not limited to our growth rate the timing and amount we spend to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services the costs to acquire or invest in businesses and technologies and the risks and uncertainties detailed in the “risk factors” section of item 1a of part i of this report 

 58 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk   

  

the primary objectives of our investment activities are in order of priority to preserve principal maintain liquidity and maximize yield the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility to minimize this risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities which includes assetbacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities money market funds mutual funds time deposits us government agency securities and us government securities at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our availableforsale fixed income securities held as of december 31 2017  and 2016  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points or bps 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate in millions 





foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies these foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately one  month 

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound chinese yuan euro and the indian rupee approximately 73 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of eighteen  months or less the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was a reduction to operating expenses of 01 and 11 for the year ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively see note 5 derivative instruments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our derivative and hedging activity 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december 31 2017  and as of december 31 2016  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of nonus dollar cash cash equivalents and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10 movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash cash equivalents and investments we would report in us dollars as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  by less than 1 respectively 

 59 

equity price risk   

our nonqualified deferred compensation or nqdc plan which may hold publiclytraded equity securities are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  the total investments under our nqdc plan were 276 million  and 210 million  respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change on the total investments under our nqdc plan would not have a material impact to the fair value of these investments respectively 

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies depending on the nature of these investments some can be carried at cost and others can be carried at fair value the carrying values of our investments in privatelyheld companies were 830 million  and 613 million  as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively the privatelyheld companies in which we invest can still be considered in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privatelyheld companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

we believe that there are several other industry trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions these trends include significant growth in internet protocol or ip traffic on service provider networks because of peertopeer interaction broadband usage video an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our service provider customers and of their enterprise customers the advent of data center clouds to deliver business applications via ip network connected facilities network functions virtualization or nfv to allow more flexible deployment models and growth in mobile traffic as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including smartphones tablets and connected devices of various kinds

as with the service provider market innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market we believe that as enterprises transition their workloads to the cloud they will seek greater flexibility in how they consume networking and security services whether they plan to move to a public cloud or hybrid cloud architecture these are key technology areas where we are innovating highperformance enterprises require ip networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance reliability and security with bestinclass open solutions for maximum flexibility we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers as well as branch and campus applications 

customers 

in 2016  2015  and 2014  no  single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues 

products services and technology   

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for servicerich platforms at the edge of the network was created 

we have expanded our portfolio to address multiple domains in the network core edge access and aggregation data centers and campus and branch we have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon systems and software including our junos operating system virtualized network functions such as firewall as well as softwaredefined networks or sdn clouddelivered services and automation software to provide a range of hardware and software solutions in highperformance networking that can solve unique problems for our customers

platform strategy   

in addition to our major hardware product families our software portfolio has been a key technology element in our goal to be a leader in highperformance networking 

our junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers the junos platform includes the following products 

 

 

 

 

junos os is designed to improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades this operational efficiency allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenuegenerating applications helping to advance the economics of highperformance networking 

the security and stability of junos os combined with its modular architecture and common source code base provides a foundation for delivering performance reliability security and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments with an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage junos os including routing switching and security products we believe junos os provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors

we also expanded our global alliances with nec to deliver nfvbased solutions that allow service providers and enterprises to gain greater service agility through automation 

in addition in 2016 we completed three acquisitions that we expect will further enhance our product portfolio to accelerate our strategy in the cloud transition first we acquired bti systems inc or bti to accelerate our ability to address the fast growing data center interconnect or dci and metro ethernet markets with a breadth of open programmable and automated packet optical transport solutions second we acquired aurrion inc or aurrion which we expect will strengthen our longterm competitive advantage in costeffective highdensity highspeed optical networks lastly we acquired appformix inc which we expect will complement the analytics and capabilities of contrail and help customers enhance their cloud operations we will continue to look at targeted and strategic acquisitions that we believe can complement our product portfolio operations or rd strategy 

research and development 

we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols software applications and platforms and embedded operating systems as of december 31 2016  we employed 4054 people in our worldwide rd organization 

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications integrating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings in our products we are leveraging our software asic and systems technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers applications and continuing to develop technology to support the buildout of high performance networks and cloud environments we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

our rd process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our rd team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market expenditures for rd were 10137 million  9945 million  and 10062 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

sales and marketing 

as of december 31 2016  we employed 2590 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals business development teams systems engineers marketing teams channel teams and an operational infrastructure team are generally distributed between vertical markets within each team sales team members serve the following three geographic regions i americas including united states canada mexico caribbean and central and south america ii emea and iii apac within each region there are regional and country teams as well as vertical market focused teams to ensure we operate close to our customers 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships as described below 

we sell to a number of service providers directly otherwise we sell to both service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers 

 10 

direct sales structure 

the terms and conditions of direct purchasing arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our order acknowledgment terms for those orders or by purchase contracts the direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

channel sales structure 

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales we utilize various channel partners including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 11 

manufacturing and operations 

as of december 31 2016  we employed 358  people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our supply chain which include our contract manufacturers original design manufacturers component suppliers warehousing and logistics 

our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in the united states or us china malaysia mexico and taiwan as of december 31 2016  we utilized celestica incorporated flextronics international ltd accton technology corporation and alpha networks inc for the majority of our manufacturing activity our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement surface mount assembly final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required for our products to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

 

 

 

our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to agreedupon specifications products are then shipped to our distributors vars or endusers generally we do not own the components title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the contract manufacturers location customers take title to the products upon delivery at a specified destination if the product or components remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges 

our contracts with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer as applicable may accept purchase orders from us these contracts do not represent longterm commitments 

we also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical component supplies the majority of this inventory is production components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand 

some of our custom components such as asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs 

by working collaboratively with our suppliers we endeavor to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and throughout our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted a supplier code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers one element of our supplier code of conduct is adoption and compliance with the electronic industry code of conduct or the eicc the eicc a coalition of electronics retail auto and toy companies provides guidelines and resources to drive performance and compliance with critical corporate social responsibility policies its goal is to promote ethical business practices eliminate human trafficking and to ensure that working conditions in the electronic industry supply chain are safe that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible our corporate citizenship report and supplier code of conduct are available on our website 

 12 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements either with our distributors resellers or customers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  our total product backlog was approximately 4412 million  and 5174 million  respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers generally within the next six months and excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sellthrough to endusers backlog also excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts 

seasonality 

we as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns historically we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

competition 

we compete in the network infrastructure markets these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer agility advantages in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc or cisco has historically been the dominant player however our principal competitors also include arista networks inc or arista brocade communications systems inc or brocade which is expected to be acquired by broadcom limited in 2017 dell inc or dell hewlett packard enterprise co or hpe huawei technologies co ltd or huawei and nokia corporation or nokia 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco nokia hpe and huawei among others have broader portfolios which enable them to bundle their networking products with other networking and information technology products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition marketing budgets and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

in addition there are a number of other competitors in the security network infrastructure space including palo alto networks inc or palo alto networks check point software technologies ltd or check point f5 networks inc or f5 networks and fortinet inc or fortinet among others who tend to be focused specifically on security solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line 

we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco nokia and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that aim to build products with greater capabilities to compete with our products further there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue which may increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios 

in addition to established competitors a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior and cost effective in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have and also from emerging companies that are developing new technologies although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

environment   

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment such as the waste 

 13 

electrical and electronic equipment or weee directive directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment or rohs and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals or reach regulations adopted by the european union and china to date compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however see the risk factor entitled regulation of our industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects in the section entitled risk factors  in item 1a of part i of this report for additional information concerning regulatory compliance 

juniper’s greatest impact on the environment is through our products and services juniper has an environmental program based on our new product introduction process that focuses on energy efficiency materials innovation and recyclability 

we are committed to the environment through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput of key elements in our highperformance network product offerings with the launch of the ptx series we pioneered among other groundbreaking achievements record energy efficiency of 15w per gigabit of throughput since then we have continued to enhance the ptx series delivering marketleading energy efficiency of 12w per gigabit of throughput in 2014 and further improving energy efficiency of 04w per gigabit with the 3tbps fpc3 linecard in 2015 in addition our mx series 3d universal edge routers are delivering breakthrough energy efficiency of 08w per gigabit at the network edge breaking the 1w per gigabit barrier the environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business 

we are also voluntarily participating in the carbon disclosure project or cdp climate and water disclosures and encourage our direct material suppliers representing an aggregate of at least 80 of our consolidated total direct expenditure to do the same cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors and customers additionally juniper is a member of the eicc and has adopted and promotes the adoption by our suppliers of the practices of the eicc code of conduct as discussed above we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to execute on monitor and drive environmental improvements in our global operations and within our supply chain 

intellectual property   

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products and from time to time we need to renegotiate these licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2016  we had over 2900 patents worldwide and numerous patent applications are pending patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

employees   

as of december 31 2016  we had 9832 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

investments in our securities involve significant risks even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered in the past significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors disclosed by us including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our business operating results and stock price 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

the factors that may cause our quarterly results to vary quarter by quarter and be unpredictable include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in customer mix changes in the mix of products and services sold changes in the mix of geographies in which our products and services are sold changing market and economic conditions current and potential customer partner and supplier consolidation and concentration competition long sales and implementation cycles unpredictable ordering patterns changes in the amount and frequency of share repurchases or dividends regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example we and many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending particularly in the first quarter furthermore market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs issues with product quality regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations such adjustments may be difficult or impossible to execute in the short or medium term 

as a result of these factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some quarters our operating results will be below our guidance our longterm financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline and has declined in the past such a decline could also occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or uncertainty customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses in addition economic instability or uncertainty as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world have and may continue to put pressure on economic conditions which has led and could lead to reduced demand for our products to delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects andor higher costs of production more generallyspeaking economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore instability in the global markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the short and medium term therefore fluctuations in revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margins from quarter to quarter uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 17 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions 

from time to time we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount acquiring companies and increasing our investment in rd sales and marketing and other parts of our business conversely in 2014 to refocus the company’s strategy optimize its structure and improve operational efficiencies we implemented a new strategic focus realigned our organization into a onejuniper structure reduced our workforce consolidated and closed facilities made changes to enhance efficiency improved cost management measures and instituted a new capital allocation plan in connection with our cost management measures we implemented a substantial cost reduction plan accomplished through various restructuring activities across research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the underperformance of our security reporting unit and product rationalizations further strategyrelated pivots could lead to delays in achieving revenue and profit forecasts and result in additional impairment some of our expenses are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time and the level of gross margins achieved by us in recent years may not be sustainable 

we expect our product and service gross margins to vary both in the nearterm and in the longterm and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors some of which have occurred and may occur in the future including customer product and geographic mix shifts an increase or decrease in our software sales or services we provide increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete changes in the actions of our competitors or their pricing strategies which may be difficult to predict and respond to currency fluctuations that impact our costs or the cost of our products and services to our customers increases in material labor or inventory carrying costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers issues with manufacturing or component quality or efficiencies increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if we do not accurately forecast product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products and enhancements or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures for example in fiscal year 2016 our margins decreased compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to elevated pricing pressure and product mix in fiscal year 2015 our margins increased compared to fiscal year 2014 as a result of higher restructuring and other charges recorded in 2014 but not in 2015 in connection with the restructuring plan we initiated in the first quarter of 2014 in fiscal year 2014 our margins declined compared to fiscal year 2013 as a result of higher inventory charges resulting from product rationalizations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan and an industrywide memory product quality defect for a component from a third party we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

further we will continue to remain diligent in our longterm financial objective to increase revenue and operating margins and manage our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue we expect that our margins will vary with our ability to achieve these goals we can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve all or any of the goals of these plans or meet our announced expectations in whole or in part or that our plans will have the intended effect of improving our margins on the expected timeline or at all

a limited number of our customers comprise a material portion of our revenues and any changes in the way they purchase products and services from us could affect our business in addition there is an ongoing trend toward consolidation in the industry in which our customers and partners operate any decrease in revenues from our customers or partners could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

a material portion of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners particularly in our service provider market changes in the business requirements or focus vendor selection project prioritization financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior including product mix purchased of our key customers could significantly decrease our sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in recent years there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example altice’s purchase of cablevision and portugal telecom liberty globals acquisition of cable  wireless communications charter communications incs acquisition of time warner cable inc and centurylinks proposed acquisition of level 3 communications and that consolidation trend has continued certain telecommunications companies have also announced their intent towards vertical consolidation through acquisitions of media and content companies such as verizon’s proposed acquisition of yahoo and att’s proposed acquisition of time warner if our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay suspend or indefinitely reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or other direct or indirect unforeseen consequences could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competition is intense in the markets that we serve the network equipment market has historically been dominated by cisco with competition coming from other companies such as nokia corporation following its acquisition of alcatellucent arista brocade hpe and huawei in the security market we face intense competition from cisco and palo alto networks as well as companies such as check point f5 networks fortinet and hpe further a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition by or of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all for example in recent years nokia corporation merged with alcatellucent hpe acquired aruba networks cisco acquired opendns symantec corporation acquired blue coat systems and dell acquired emc which further consolidated our market a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do in addition some of our competitors have become more integrated including through consolidation and offer a broader range of products and services which could make their solutions more attractive to our customers many of our competitors sell networking products as bundled solutions with other it products such as computer and storage systems if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our partners and resellers generally sell or resell competing products on a nonexclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete which could also adversely affect our business 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

a customers decision to purchase certain of our products particularly new products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times both of which may be exacerbated by the impact of continued global economic weakness may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

 19 

the timing of product orders andor our reliance on revenue from sales of software or subscription and professional support and maintenance services may cause us to recognize revenue in a different period than the one in which a transaction takes place this may make it difficult for investors to observe quarterly trends and may cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin on a quarterly basis 

generally our network equipment products are stocked only in limited quantities by our distributors and resellers due to the cost complexity and custom nature of configurations required by our customers we generally build such products as orders are received the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter remains unpredictable if orders for certain products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter 

in addition services revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue comprising 29 27 and 26 of total revenue in fiscal year 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively sales of new or renewal professional services support and maintenance contracts may decline andor fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors and reductions in our endcustomers’ spending levels we recognize professional services support and maintenance revenue periodically over the term of the relevant service period 

the introduction of new software products is part of our intended strategy to expand our software business and software revenues may be recognized periodically over the term of the relevant use period or subscription period as a result much of the software subscription and support and maintenance revenue we report each fiscal quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from software subscription and support and maintenance contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed contracts in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our software subscriptions or support and maintenance is not reflected in full in our operating results until future periods also it is difficult for us to rapidly increase our software or services revenue through additional software or services sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal software subscription and support and maintenance contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

additionally we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products product enhancements and business strategies that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available or strategies are not executed in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements continued price pressures and a constantly evolving industry we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future technological shifts market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet such technological shifts needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all for example the move from traditional network infrastructures towards softwaredefined networking or sdn has been receiving considerable attention in our view it will take several years to see the full impact of sdn and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine hardware and software elements if we fail to anticipate market requirements or opportunities or fail to develop and introduce new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we invest time energy and resources in developing products for a market that doesnt develop it could likewise significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products enhancements or business strategies there can be no assurance that new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

in the past two years we have announced a number of new products and enhancements to our hardware and software products across routing switching and security including acx5000 and acx500 routers qfx10000 line of spine switches qfx5100 qfx5200 qfx5100aa qfxpfa srx300 srx1500 srx5000 with express path and srx5800 series services gateways ex9200 ex4600 ex2300 and ex3400 ethernet switches new mx series linecards and routers including the vmx 3d universal edge router new ptx series line cards powered by our expressplus custom silicon junos fusion provider edge junos fusion data center junos fusion enterprise a disaggregated version of junos software ptx1000 vsrx virtual firewall sky advanced

the introduction of new software products is part of our intended strategy to expand our software business we have also begun to disaggregate certain software from certain hardware products such that customers would be able to purchase or license our hardware and software products independently which we expect could in time enable our hardware to be deployed with third party networking applications and services and our software to be used with third party hardware for example we have developed a disaggregated version of our junos software and introduced our qfx5200 series of switches which runs our disaggregated junos software the success of our strategy to expand our software business including our strategy to disaggregate software from certain hardware products is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of our new products or business strategies do not gain market acceptance or meet our expectations for growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected and our competitive position and our business and financial results could be harmed 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to or disruptions in those relationships or manufacturing processes expected or unexpected may result in delays that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships which includes failing to provide accurate forecasts of our requirements or if one or more of them experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future an increase in the expected time required to manufacture our products or ship products such delays could result in supply shortfalls that damage our ability to meet customer demand for those products and could cause our customers to purchase alternative products from our competitors also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers or the introduction of new products by us would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other foreign countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states including the possibility of import tariffs imposed by the new administration each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 21 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

we provide demand forecasts for our products to our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our original design or contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins for example in certain prior quarters our gross margins were reduced as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time and because our contract manufacturers are thirdparty manufacturers for numerous other companies if we underestimate our requirements as we have in certain prior quarters with respect to certain products our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products which could increase costs or delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues and negatively impacting customer satisfaction 

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and proprietary business information of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy the growing cyber risk environment means that individuals companies and organizations of all sizes including juniper are increasingly subject to the threat of intrusions on their networks and systems by a wide range of actors on an ongoing and regular basis despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to penetration or attacks by computer programmers hackers or sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions if any breach compromises our networks creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost or stolen and we may be subject to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and suffer reputational and financial harm in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks this can be true even for “legacy” products that have been determined to have reached an end of life engineering status but will continue to operate for a limited amount of time 

for example in december 2015 we disclosed that we identified unauthorized code in our screenos security system that could allow a knowledgeable attacker to gain administrative access to netscreen devices and to decrypt vpn connections following the identification of the screenos vulnerabilities we launched an investigation into the matter developed patched releases for the latest versions of screenos and notified customers all of which required significant time and attention from management and our employees in addition in april 2016 we made additional changes to screenos in response to our additional analysis as a part of an update of screenos at this time we do not have an estimate of third party costs related to the screenos matter that could result from any third party claims brought against us including for example indemnification for damages our customers may incur or actions instituted by governmental or regulatory entities that could result in fines or other penalties costs related to the screenos matter including the costs to resolve third party claims may be material 

as a result of the screenos matter or any other actual or perceived breach of network security that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products and our overall reputation could be harmed because the techniques used by attackers many of whom are highly sophisticated and wellfunded to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques or the vulnerabilities they have caused this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions which could have an adverse impact on our financial results the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities including the screenos matter could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the attacker which are often difficult to pinpoint additionally we could be subject to regulatory investigations potential fines and litigation in connection with a security breach or related issue and be liable to third parties for these types of breaches 

 22 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages quality issues or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

we rely on single or limited sources of certain of our components during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited for example some optical transceivers and memory components used in our networking solutions might experience extended lead times given the demand in the market any future spike in growth in our business or more likely in it spending and the economy in general is likely to create greater shortterm pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed for example from time to time we have experienced component shortages or quality issues that resulted in delays of product shipments andor warranty claims we currently purchase numerous key components including asics and other semiconductor chips from single or limited sources and many of our component suppliers are concentrated in china in addition there has been consolidation among certain suppliers of our components for example globalfoundries recently acquired ibm’s semiconductor manufacturing business avago technologies limited recently acquired broadcom corporation and intel corporation recently acquired altera corporation consolidation among suppliers can result in the reduction of the number of independent suppliers of components available to us which could negatively impact our ability to access certain component parts or the prices we have to pay for such parts in addition our suppliers may determine not to continue a business relationship with us for other reasons that may be beyond our control any disruptions to our supply chain could decrease our sales earnings and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to increases in wages that drive up prices the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes on key components labor stoppages transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters civil unrest geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services 

the development of alternate sources for key components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules also longterm supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may further increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

we rely on valueadded and other resellers as well as distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded and other reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm dimension data and nec corporation the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products and some of which sell their own competing products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues for example in 2011 and 2012 one of our oem partners dell acquired force10 and sonicwall both competitors of ours as a result dell became increasingly competitive in certain areas their resale of our products declined and we ultimately terminated our oem relationship with dell in addition in 2016 nokia corporation merged with alcatellucent a competitor of ours and in 2015 cisco recently announced a partnership with ericsson which is one of our existing partners our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets fail to expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively determine that we cannot continue to do business with these partners for any reason or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

 23 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and scale and improve our processes and procedures that support the channel as a result our programs processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage we have previously entered into oem agreements with partners pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the programs processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products we also depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers data center providers or other partners as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology or it systems the systems and processes of third parties and the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed for example although it did not adversely affect our shipments an earthquake in late december of 2006 disrupted our communications with china where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs 

we are also in the process of further consolidating our onsite data centers to the cloud and to offsite facilities that are hosted and controlled by thirdparties these cloud providers and offsite facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures equipment failure adverse events caused by operator error and similar events in addition because we lease our cloud storage space and offsite data center facilities we cannot be assured that we will be able to expand our data center infrastructure to meet user demand in a timely manner or on favorable economic terms if we have issues receiving and processing data this may delay our ability to provide products and services to our customers and damage our business we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturers were not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us which prevented us from meeting our commitments to our customers if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business for example in december 2016 we acquired appformix inc in august 2016 we acquired aurrion inc and in april 2016 we acquired bti systems inc in 2014 we acquired wandl inc and in 2012 we acquired contrail systems inc and mykonos software inc acquisitions involve numerous risks including but not limited to problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs and liabilities diversion of managements attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired business if we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 24 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders use a substantial portion of our cash resources assume liabilities record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies and our other large customers generally require onerous terms and conditions in our contracts with them as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies which comprise a significant portion of our customer base and other large companies generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and accordingly often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers for example our customers france telecomorange and deutsche telekom ag have formed a company for the purpose of purchasing products from and negotiating more favorable contractual terms with suppliers as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

in addition service providers have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased patent litigation brought against customers by nonpracticing entities in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in customers requesting or requiring vendors to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to lawsuits investigations proceedings and other disputes which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay fines or damages undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors have been or are subject to various lawsuits we have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters commercial transactions and patent infringement as well as securities laws as noted in note 16 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this report under the heading of “legal proceedings” the us securities and exchange commission or the sec and the us department of justice or the doj are conducting investigations into possible violations by the company of the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa in a number of countries the investigations relate to whether the company or any third party on behalf of the company gave money or anything else of value to any government official in violation of the fcpa the company’s audit committee with the assistance of independent advisors has been investigating and conducting a thorough review of possible violations of the fcpa and has made recommendations for remedial measures including employee disciplinary actions in foreign jurisdictions which the company has implemented and continues to implement litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain we therefore cannot predict the duration scope outcome or consequences of litigation and government investigations in connection with any government investigations including those in which we are currently involved as described above if the government takes action against us or we agree to settle the matter we may be required to pay substantial fines and incur other sanctions which may be material and suffer reputational harm the lawsuits and investigations are expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights resolution of which may be time  consuming and expensive as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers 

 25 

suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights in addition increased patent litigation brought by nonpracticing entities in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in our customers requesting or requiring us to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies enter into license agreements or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us or anyone we are required to indemnify by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or if we license required proprietary rights our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

regulation of our industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects 

we are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas for example some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria even though those criteria may be in conflict with accepted international standards other regulations that may negatively impact our business include country of origin regulations these types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements applicable to public companies regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries which we refer to collectively as the drc and procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals” these minerals are present in our products sec rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply drc “conflict free” components and parts and we may not be able to obtain drc conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products in addition the european union reached agreement in late 2016 on a euwide conflict minerals rule under which most eu importers of tin tungsten tantalum gold and their ores will have to conduct due diligence to ensure the minerals do not originate from conflict zones and do not fund armed conflicts large manufacturers also will have to disclose how they plan to monitor their sources to comply with the rules the regulation is expected to be adopted in 2017 with compliance required by 2021 

in addition environmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment may adversely impact our business and financial condition these laws and regulations include among others the european union or eu restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive or rohs the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products currently our products comply with the eu rohs requirements however certain exemptions are scheduled to lapse or have lapsed including an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment upon which we and our competitors had relied which expired in july 2016 the lapse of this exemption further changes to this or other laws or passage of similar laws in the eu or other jurisdictions would require us to cease selling noncompliant products in the eu and to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us disrupt our operations or logistics and result in an adverse impact on our operating results in addition in validating the compliance of our products with applicable hazardous materials restrictions we rely substantially on affirmations by our component suppliers as to the compliance of their products with respect to those same restrictions failure by our component suppliers to furnish accurate and timely information could subject us to penalties or liability for violation of such hazardous materials restrictions interrupt our supply of products to the eu and result in our customers refusing or being unable to purchase our products additionally the eu and a number of other countries have adopted regulations requiring producers of electrical and electronic equipment to assume certain responsibilities for collecting treating recycling and disposing of products when they have reached the end of their useful life finally the eu reach regulations regulate the handling of certain chemical substances that may be used in our products 

the traditional telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the internet telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks but future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the internet and internet service provider access charges we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service providers or cloud provider companies regulations governing 

 26 

the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers needs for products for instance the us federal communications commission has issued regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks these regulations which were challenged in court and which the new federal communications commission leadership is considering removing or modifying might impact service provider and cloud provider business models and as such providers needs for internet telecommunications equipment and services also many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security supply chain integrity privacy and data protection any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment 

the adoption and implementation of additional regulations could reduce demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products result in product inventory writeoffs impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner require us to spend significant time and expense to comply and subject us to fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

governmental regulations and economic sanctions affecting the import or export of products generally or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls and restrictions on the import or export of among other things our products that contain or use encryption technology most of our products contain or use encryption technology and consequently are subject to such controls requirements and restrictions in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring certification notifications review of source code limiting the encryption features or the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys for example china has proposed new conditions on eligibility of encryption products for purchase by government and certain nongovernment organizations india recently proposed and then withdrew regulations imposing serious conditions on the use of encryption in telecommunications products we sell our products to both commercial customers and directly and indirectly to governments around the world our ability to sell into substantial government markets whether or not the products we sell include encryption is vulnerable to changes in government procurement regulations any associated local content requirements and changes in the government’s interpretation of such regulations in addition the us government has broader sanctions and embargoes that generally forbid supply of most items to or involving certain countries territories governments legal entities and individuals including recent restrictions imposed by the us and eu on exports to russia and ukraine we have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into these countries or to prohibited entities or individuals but there can be no assurance that they will always be effective 

governmental regulation of encryption or ip networking technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or related economic sanctions could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues and operating results in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in harm to our reputation and ability to compete in international markets penalties costs seizure of assets including source code and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or governmentfunded projects 

our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a variety of state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these privacy and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development and offering of new products and services 

for example we previously relied upon adherence to the us department of commerce’s safe harbor privacy principles and compliance with the useu safe harbor framework which we refer to as the safe harbor agreed to by the us department of commerce and the eu the safe harbor which established means for legitimizing the transfer of personal data by us companies from the european economic area or eea to the us was invalidated in 2015 by a decision of the european court of justice or the ecj now that the eu and us have implemented a successor privacy framework called the privacy shield we are reviewing and documenting our practices required to obtain certification under the privacy shield in addition to entering into eu model contracts with our vendors where appropriate and feasible in anticipation of the possibility that the privacy shield may be legally challenged or voided like safe harbor in an uncertain political environment in addition the june 2016 approval by voters in the united kingdom or uk of a referendum to leave the eu could require us to make additional changes to the way we conduct our business and transmit data between the uk and the eu 

 27 

our actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect personal data could result in enforcement actions significant penalties or other legal action against us or our customers or suppliers which could result in negative publicity increase our operating costs subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

a number of our team members are foreign nationals who rely on visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the united states and other countries in recent years the united states has increased the level of scrutiny in granting h1b l1 and other business visas in addition the current us administration has indicated that immigration reform is a priority compliance with united states immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals any of these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

we are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill annually or more frequently if certain circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible assets below their carrying values as of december 31 2016  our goodwill was 30817 million  and intangible assets with indefinite lives was 490 million  when the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill or if the carrying amount of an intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value a charge to operations is recorded either event would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred 

in the past we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million due to the underperformance of our security reporting unit and product rationalizations 

in recent years economic weakness has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours declines in our level of revenues due to restructuring or cost reductions or declines in our operating margins or sustained declines in our stock price increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives may become impaired in future periods 

our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis such as expected future cash flows the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets and our stock price if the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets however any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by the following earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement costs related to intercompany restructuring tax effects of sharebased compensation challenges to our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof on october 5 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development or oecd an international association of 35 countries including the us published final proposals under its base erosion and profit shifting or beps action plan the beps action plan includes fifteen actions to address beps 

 28 

in a comprehensive manner and represents a significant change to the international corporate tax landscape these proposals as adopted by countries may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes furthermore the current us administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer us taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service or irs and other tax authorities it is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes but the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made there can be no assurance that the outcomes from continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our ability to compete 

we generally rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology any of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings and other competitive harm 

in addition despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that the agreements we have entered into will not be breached we cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 

furthermore the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and vars in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the united states in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic business regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including the following 

 

 

 



 29 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the june 2016 approval by voters in the uk of a referendum to leave the eu commonly referred to as brexit has caused and may continue to cause uncertainty in the global markets the uk’s proposed exit from the eu if implemented   will take some period of time to complete and could result in regulatory changes that impact our business for example changes to the way service providers conduct business and transmit data between the uk and the eu could require us to make changes to the way we handle customer data we will also review the impact of any resulting changes to eu or uk law that could affect our operations such as labor policies financial planning product manufacturing and product distribution political and regulatory responses to the vote are still developing and we are in the process of assessing the impact the vote may have on our business as more information becomes available nevertheless because we conduct business in the eu including the uk any of the effects of brexit including those we cannot anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the united states or in other countries in which we operate in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors channel partners and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in termination of our relationship financial reporting problems fines andor penalties for us or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

because a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro indian rupee and japanese yen related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars this could negatively affect our ability to meet our customers pricing expectations in those markets and may result in erosion of gross margin and market share a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities however such attempts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations are costly and no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances including 

 30 

longterm declines in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

approximately 125 million of the transaction consideration we received from the divestiture of our junos pulse product portfolio is in the form of a noncontingent seller promissory note and we may not receive the amount owed to us including accrued interest including in the time frame contemplated by the buyer under the note 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed the sale of our junos pulse product portfolio to an affiliate of siris capital a private equity firm for total consideration of 2307 million of which 1057 million was in cash net of a 193 million working capital adjustment and 1250 million was in the form of an 18month noncontingent interestbearing promissory note issued to the company on october 2 2015 the company and the issuer of the promissory note agreed to modify the original terms of the note to extend the maturity date from april 1 2016 to december 31 2018 since approximately 1250 million of the transaction consideration is in the form of a noncontingent seller promissory note there is the risk that we may not receive the amount owed to us including accrued interest including in the time frame contemplated under the note in the event that the promissory note is not repaid on the terms we contemplate any collection or restructuring efforts we undertake may be costly and require significant time and attention from our management and there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover the amounts owed to us in full 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to effectively improve our systems and processes our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected defects errors or malware or do not meet customer quality expectations our business could be adversely affected and we may be subject to additional costs or lawsuits or be required to pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers for example in december 2015 we disclosed that we identified unauthorized code in screenos that could allow a knowledgeable attacker to gain administrative access to netscreen devices and to decrypt vpn connections 

any errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in monetary penalties loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and reputation penalties and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations following the identification of the screenos vulnerabilities we launched an investigation into the matter developed patched releases for the latest versions of screenos and notified customers all of which required significant time and attention from management and our employees in addition in the event an error defect malware or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty or indemnification defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed moreover if our products fail to satisfy our customers quality expectations for whatever reason the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our 

 31 

products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or are not available on terms acceptable to us our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to renegotiate our current third party licenses or license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the failure to comply with the terms of any license including free open source software may result in our inability to continue to use such license some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them in addition we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us if possible to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the buildout of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when our customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the software and equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and publicly disclose material weaknesses in our controls any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception and our stock price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness or significant deficiency investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major credit rating agencies routinely evaluate our indebtedness this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

 32 

we may be unable to generate the cash flow to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our debt obligations including the senior notes and the revolving credit facility 

in february 2016 we issued 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 3125 senior notes due 2019 which we refer to as the 2019 notes and 1500 million aggregate principal amount of 45 senior notes due 2024 which we refer to as the 2024 notes in march 2015 we issued 3000 million aggregate principal amount of 330 senior notes due 2020 which we refer to as the 2020 notes and 3000 million aggregate principal amount of 435 senior notes due 2025 which we refer to as the 2025 notes in addition in march 2014 we issued 3500 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 notes and in march 2011 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes which we refer to as the senior notes and together with the 2019 notes 2020 notes 2024 notes and 2025 notes the notes see discussion in note 9 debt and financing  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report as of december 31 2016  we had 21337 million  in outstanding longterm debt in june 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility which we refer to as the revolving credit facility with an option to increase the revolving credit facility up to a maximum of 7000 million the credit agreement will terminate in june 2019 at which point all amounts borrowed must be repaid as of december 31 2016  no amounts were outstanding under the credit agreement 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon our ability to pay our expenses satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance which will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control based upon current levels of operations we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon however if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt we may be required to sell assets reduce capital expenditures refinance all or a portion of our existing debt including the notes repatriate offshore cash to the us at unfavorable tax rates or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the indentures that govern the notes contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

the credit agreement contains two financial covenants along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following 

 

 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business a failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default in addition in the event of an acceleration we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments including those under the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon 

 33 

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

in january 2017 we announced a cash dividend of 010 per share of common stock payable on march 22 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 1 2017 our ability to pay quarterly dividends or achieve our intended capital return policy will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital and debt service requirements use of cash for acquisitions and other factors any failure to pay or increase future dividends as announced or a reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

we have announced that beginning in 2017 we intend to target a capital return policy inclusive of share repurchases and dividends of approximately 50 of annual free cash flow free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures any failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our shareholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at december 31 2016  we had 18332 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 18241 million  in short and longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in assetbacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities government sponsored enterprise obligations money market funds mutual funds publiclytraded equity securities time deposits and us government securities certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market sovereign debt and interest rate risks our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction the us district court for the district of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law our restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws iv any action or proceeding asserting a claim as to which delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction on the court of chancery or v any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could have a material and adverse impact on our business 

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

business and market environment 

juniper networks designs develops and sells products and services for highperformance networks to enable customers to build scalable reliable secure and costeffective networks for their businesses while achieving agility efficiency and value through automation we focus on customers and partners across our key market verticals who view these network attributes as fundamental to their business including telecom cable providers cloud providers national government financial services and strategic enterprise verticals 

our products are sold in three geographic regions americas europe middle east and africa or emea and asia pacific or apac our highperformance routing switching and security networking products and service offerings are sold to global service providers cloud providers national governments research and public sector organizations and other enterprises who view the network as critical to their success we believe that our silicon systems and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking helping our customers achieve superior performance greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership in addition to our products we offer our customers worldwide services including technical support professional services and education and training programs 

our fiscal 2016 results saw modest net revenue growth that was primarily driven by cloud providers which increased more than 25 in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 while routing revenue was slightly down our ptx family of products had significant yearoveryear growth switching revenue increased 12 in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by continued data center strength led by our qfx family of products which increased more than 50 yearoveryear our security revenues continued to decline as this component of our business is transitioning from legacy security products to our new srx security offerings which were introduced throughout 2016 we expect this transition in security to continue over the next few quarters our services business continues to be strong with another year of solid yearoveryear revenue growth increasing 13 in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 

in reviewing our top 10 customers for the year four were cloud providers four were telecoms and two were enterprises of these customers two were located outside of the us 

we continue to operate in a competitive market and expect the timing of our customers’ deployment patterns to vary from quarter to quarter we intend to manage our business in 2017 with these considerations in mind and will continue to focus on driving shareholder value we expect to adhere to the following three financial principles that provide insight into our operating plans for 2017 

 

 

 39 

 

we are focused on operational excellence cost discipline and targeted growth initiatives as well as partnerships and expect to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in 2016 we completed three acquisitions that we expect will further enhance our product portfolio and that we believe will allow us to accelerate our strategy to transition to cloudbased markets in april 2016 we acquired optical equipment provider bti systems inc or bti which we expect will accelerate our ability to address the data center interconnect or dci and metro ethernet markets with open programmable and automated packet optical transport solutions then in august 2016 we acquired aurrion inc or aurrion a provider of fabless silicon photonic technology which we expect will strengthen our longterm competitive advantage in costeffective highdensity highspeed optical networks lastly in december 2016 we acquired appformix a company focused on cloud infrastructure optimization software which we expect will complement the analytics and capabilities of contrail and help customers enhance their cloud operations we expect that we will continue to look at targeted and strategic acquisitions that we believe can complement our product portfolio operations or rd strategy 

further our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operation of networks and to allow our customers across our key verticals to deliver real value over those networks we anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue over time 

in 2016 we continued to execute on our strategy with significant advancements in performance and automation across a number of key solution areas and announced a number of new products and enhancements to our hardware and software products across routing switching and security 

in routing our solution for wide area ip transport across data center interconnect metro and core was enhanced with the introduction of our newest ptx linecards coupled with our multilayer optimization controller northstar 

in switching we announced two new access switches the ex2300 and ex3400 in 2016 further we introduced juniper networks cloudenabled branch a solution that will allow enterprises and managed service providers alike to create and automate delivery of branch office networking services ondemand 

in security we announced juniper networks csrx a nextgeneration containerized firewall providing advanced security services for softwaredefined secure networks or sdsn as well as a multicore version of the juniper networks vsrx we also announced junos space security director policy enforcer new srx4100 and srx4200 firewalls and new enhancements to sky advanced threat prevention or sky atp to further build out our sdsn platform 

we also expanded our global alliances with nec to deliver nfvbased solutions that allow service providers and enterprises to gain greater service agility through automation 

we believe we are entering 2017 with a competitive product portfolio and a determination to enable our customers cloud businesses or to successfully migrate to cloud architectures the cloud transformation is our primary area of strategic focus as we see significant opportunities arising from the shift towards the cloud and network automation we believe our history as an innovation leader and our understanding of high performance networking technology position us to capitalize on this industry transition

in february 2017 we completed our evaluation of the impact of a defect in a clocksignal component contained in certain of our products which may begin to fail after the product has been in operation for 18 months as advised by the third party component supplier as a result we recorded a product cost of revenue charge of approximately 108 million in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016 for the expected remediation costs of the component defect we are in the process of working with our customers and the component supplier to implement a remediation 

critical accounting policies and estimates   

the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our significant accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

 

goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recorded the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of november 1 st  or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 

 42 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment level by comparing the reporting units carrying value including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating results of the component 

the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test various factors are considered in the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions financial performance or a sustained decrease in share price if as a result of the qualitative assessment it is deemed more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount management will perform the quantitative test 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test if necessary involves a twostep process to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the first step tests for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units with the reporting unit’s net asset values if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting units does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the second step requires an assignment of the reporting unit’s fair value to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities using the relevant acquisition accounting guidance to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill and if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

in the first step the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using both the income and market valuation approaches we believe the income approach and the market approach are equally representative of the reporting unit’s fair value under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publiclytraded companies in similar lines of business in the application of the income and market valuation approaches we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units and then apply a control premium which is determined by considering control premiums offered as part of the acquisitions that have occurred in market segments that are comparable with our reporting units the income approach and the market approach are equally weighted to derive the fair value of the reporting unit 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we performed a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units routing switching and security this quantitative assessment was performed by determining the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach based on the outcome of the quantitative assessments we determined that the fair values of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value resulting in no goodwill impairment

we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  our contract manufacturer liabilities were 140 million  and 180 million respectively 

significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory and obsolete material exposures we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and contract manufacturer liabilities which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 

 

under our revenue recognition policies we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe if available thirdparty evidence or tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles when determining esp we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years 

 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

 44 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules in addition the oecd’s recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles as adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

results of operations 

we sell our highperformance networking products and service offerings across routing switching and security to two primary markets service provider and enterprise our determination of the market to which a particular revenue transaction relates is based primarily upon the customers industrial classification code but may also include subjective factors such as the intended use of the product the service provider market generally includes wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers the enterprise market is generally comprised of federal state and local governments research and education institutions financial services and other businesses

the following table presents product and service net revenues in millions except percentages 



2016  compared to 2015   

routing product net revenues decreased slightly in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a decline in revenues from our mx products resulting from lower demand from telecom in the americas and emea which is impacted by the timing of large deployments net revenues from our legacy t series products continued to decline as expected as we continue to transition to our nextgeneration ptx series of products these declines were significantly offset by a strong increase in revenues from our ptx series products due to higher sales to cloud providers and telecom as well as the ramp up of sales of our new products which we expect to continue over the next few quarters 

switching product net revenues increased in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of continued growth from our data center switching portfolio driven by higher net revenues from our qfx product family which increased over 50 yearoveryear driven by the ramp up of sales of our new product offerings as well as an increase in revenue from cloud providers this was partially offset by lower demand for our ex products as we transition to our new ex product portfolio we are focused on the growing cloud and data center market and expect our expanded data center switching portfolio will continue to drive revenue growth in our switching business in the foreseeable future 

security product net revenues decreased in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to lower net revenues from our srx products which have been undergoing a product refresh cycle as well as the continued decline of our screen os and other legacy products we continue to expect that our screen os and other legacy products will not contribute to meaningful security product revenue growth and should continue to decline over time we are continuing to introduce newer srx products and expect this transition to continue over the next few quarters 

the increase  in service net revenues in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015  was primarily driven by strong attach rates and renewals of support contracts 

2015  compared to 2014   

routing product net revenues increased in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of an increase from cloud providers cable and telecom in emea and apac during 2015 we saw a strong increase in demand from both service provider and enterprise markets for our routing products as well as an overall increase in net revenues from our mx960 mx2020 and ptx series products 

switching product net revenues increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to data center buildouts with telecom and cloud providers this result was enabled by the significant growth with our qfx product family additionally we saw switching net revenues growth in the americas and apac which was slightly offset by a decrease in emea we also saw a yearoveryear increase in the service provider market for our switching products 

security product net revenues decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the divestiture of our junos pulse product lines and a continuing decline in our screenos products which was partially offset by an increase in sales of our srx platform 

 46 

and security software yearoveryear additionally we also saw a decrease in security net revenues within the enterprise market which was partially offset by a slight increase in the service provider market 

the increase in service net revenues in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewals service revenues are largely correlated with product revenues therefore if product net revenues decline it can have an impact on future service revenues 

net revenues by geographic region 

the following table presents net revenues by geographic region in millions except percentages 



2016  compared to 2015   

net revenues in the americas increased  in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015  primarily driven by strong growth from cloud providers which increased almost 30 yearyearover as they build out data center environments as well as a strong increase in service revenues this was partially offset by lower revenues from cable providers due to lower demand for our mx products in the americas we continue to see opportunities for us to diversify our revenue as cloud provider customers continue to invest in data center networks and network automation 

net revenues in emea decreased  in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015  primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our strategic enterprise vertical and the timing of deployments of large telecoms partially offset by growth from cloud providers to a lesser extent certain macroeconomic uncertainties in the region and elevated pricing pressures also contributed to the decline in net revenues 

net revenues in apac increased  in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015  the increase was driven by cloud providers partially offset by telecom geographically revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in revenues from china and japan which was partially offset by a decline in revenues from australia 

2015  compared to 2014 

net revenues in the americas increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a strong increase in net revenues from both the service provider and enterprise markets the increase in both the service provider and enterprise markets within the americas was due to an increase in net revenues across routing switching and srx product net revenues as well as service net revenues in addition we saw a strong increase in net revenues from cloud providers cable and enterprise partially offset by telecom 

net revenues in emea increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in net revenues from telecom and cloud providers slightly offset by a decrease in the enterprise market 

net revenues in apac increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in net revenues from telecom and cloud providers we experienced a significant decline in china which was partially offset by an increase in net revenues in japan and australia 

 47 

net revenues by market and customer 

the following table presents net revenues by market in millions except percentages 



2016  compared to 2015 

net revenues from the service provider market increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  driven by strong growth in the americas and to a lesser extent growth in apac partially offset by emea services and switching growth was partially offset by a decline in security 

net revenues from the enterprise market slightly decreased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to a decline in revenues from security partially offset by growth in service revenue net revenue declines from the enterprise market in emea and apac were partially offset by growth in the americas 

2015  compared to 2014 

net revenues from the service provider market increased in 2015 compared to 2014 with growth from cloud providers telecom in emea and apac and cable within the service provider market we saw strength across routing switching and security with the largest increase in net revenues from routing revenue 

net revenues from the enterprise market increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to strength in service and routing and to a lesser extent switching which was partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue from our security products net revenues in the americas from the enterprise market increased across routing switching and srx security 

customer 

no customer accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during the years ended december 31 2016  2015 and 2014 

gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



our gross margins have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the mix and average selling prices of our products and services new product introductions and enhancements manufacturing costs expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations cost of support and service personnel and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 

 48 

2016  compared to 2015   

product gross margin decreased  as a percentage of product net revenues in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to elevated pricing pressures product mix and expected remediation costs of 108 million for certain products containing a defect in a clocksignal component from a thirdparty supplier partially offset by improvements in our cost structure we expect that our product gross margin will continue to vary in the future due to the mix of products sold and competitive pricing pressures we believe product gross margins as a percentage of net revenues will improve in the longterm from the continued expected acceptance of our new products and technologies the expected increase in software revenues as a percentage of total revenues as we transition to softwarebased business models and as we continue to manage costs within our supply chain 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  service gross margin increased yearoveryear due to an increase in support revenue as well as improvements in labor productivity and logistics partially offset by increased support costs related to the ramp up of new products 

2015  compared to 2014   

product gross margin increased as a percentage of product net revenues in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in product cost of revenues the decrease in cost of revenues is attributable to the nonrecurrence of restructuring charges recorded in 2014 for asset writedowns no such charges were incurred in 2015 excluding these components from prior year cost of sales yearoveryear gross margin would remain relatively consistent 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased in 2015 compared to 2014 services delivery costs increased at a slower rate than service revenue as a result of better labor efficiency and improved product quality 

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expenses in millions except percentages 



 

nm  percentage is not meaningful 

our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnelrelated costs including wages commissions bonuses benefits sharebased compensation and travel facility and information technology or it departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount we had a total of 9832 9058 and 8806 employees as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively our headcount increased by 774 employees or 9 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily in research and development driven by our 2016 business acquisitions as well as higher services and sales headcount as we focus on delivering our new products to our customers 

 49 

2016  compared to 2015   

research and development 

research and development expense increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of 178 million which was driven by higher capital expenditures related to research and development projects also contributing to the increase in research and development expense was 136 million of higher outside service costs such as consulting and higher facilities expense to a lesser extent personnelrelated expenses increased due to higher salaries wages and fringe expense partially offset by lower bonus expense the increase in salaries and wages was driven by a higher headcount of 4054 in 2016 compared to 3723 in 2015 as a result of our 2016 business acquisitions these increases were partially offset by lower costs of 141 million related to the completion of development of new products 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated expenses of 266 million driven by higher salaries and wages related to an increase in headcount of 2590 in 2016 compared to 2464 in 2015 as well as an increase in sharebased compensation expense partially offset by lower bonus and commissions expense 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense decreased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of lower personnelrelated expenses which includes a decline in sharebased compensation and lower bonus expense partially offset by higher salaries and wages additionally facilities expense decreased in 2016  compared to 2015  due to the consolidation of our buildings in sunnyvale california these declines were partially offset by an increase in outside services related to consulting projects as well as an increase in acquisition costs related to our 2016 business acquisitions 

restructuring and other charges benefits 

restructuring and other charges benefits increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  related to severance costs in connection with our 2016 business combinations 

2015  compared to 2014   

research and development 

research and development expense decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of lower headcount headcount declined from an average of 3888 in 2014 to 3724 in 2015 leading to a reduction in payroll costs and sharebased compensation in addition outside consulting services decreased due to reduced consulting expenses which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense on rd equipment and bonus expense 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 average headcount increased from 2360 in 2014 to 2464 in 2015 however the mix of employees hired in 2015 was significantly different to 2014 which resulted in lower salary and bonus expense additionally commissions expense decreased compared to 2014 as a result of the elimination of certain commission programs and a reduction in sales staff 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of higher litigation and investigation related costs incurred in 2014 in connection with the investigations into possible violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and to a lesser extent our patent litigation case with palo alto networks additionally we saw a decrease in general and administrative consulting fees which was slightly offset by a higher bad debt expense amount 

 50 

restructuring and other charges benefits 

restructuring and other charges benefits decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher charges recorded in 2014 in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan during 2014 we implemented the 2014 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of 1662 million related to workforce reductions contract terminations project cancellations and facility closures the 2014 restructuring plan has been substantially completed as of december 31 2014 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded 04 million of severance costs and a benefit of 10 million for facilities that were recorded in restructuring and other charges benefits in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the 2014 restructuring plan see note 9  restructuring and other charges benefits  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our restructuring activities 

impairment of goodwill 

in 2014 we determined that the security reporting units carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations no such charges were recorded in 2015 or 2016 

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation expense associated with equity incentive awards or awards which include stock options restricted stock units or rsus restricted stock awards or rsas and performance share awards or psas as well as our employee stock purchase plan or espp was recorded in the following cost and expense categories in millions except percentages 



2016  compared to 2015   

sharebased compensation expense increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to an increase in actual shares vested as well as additional expense related to equitybased awards assumed in connection with our 2016 business acquisitions 

2015  compared to 2014   

sharebased compensation expense decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 the decrease in expense was primarily related to a decline in actual shares vested

other expense income net 

the following table presents other expense income net in millions except percentages 



 

nm  percentage is not meaningful 

other expense income net 

interest income primarily includes interest earned from our cash cash equivalents investments and promissory note issued to juniper in connection with the sale of junos pulse interest expense primarily includes interest net of capitalized interest expense 

from our shortterm and longterm debt and customer financing arrangements loss gain on investments net primarily includes gains and losses from the sale of investments in privatelyheld companies and includes any impairment charges recorded on these investments other typically consists of foreign exchange gains and losses and other nonoperational income and expense items 

2016  compared to 2015   

interest income 

interest income increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to higher interest income on our pulse note receivable due to an increase in the interest rate as well as higher yields from our investment portfolio see note 8 other financial information  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our pulse note receivable 

interest expense 

interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the issuance of our 2019 and 2024 notes partially offset by the repayment of debt in the first quarter of 2016 see note 10 debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2019 and 2024 notes 

loss gain on investments net 

during the year ended december 31 2016  we recorded net losses on investments of 18 million  which was primarily driven by impairments on our investments in privatelyheld companies whereas during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded a gain on investments of 73 million related to the sale of an investment in a privatelyheld company which was partially offset by impairments in investments of other privatelyheld companies 

  

2015  compared to 2014   

interest income 

interest income increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a higher balance of longer term investments yielding higher interest as well as a full year of interest income on the pulse note receivable 

 52 

interest expense 

interest expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the issuance of our 2020 and 2025 notes in the first quarter of 2015 see note 10 debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2020 and 2025 notes 

gain on legal settlement net 

during the year ended december 31 2015 no litigationrelated gains were recorded while in 2014 we entered into a settlement agreement with palo alto networks resolving patent litigation between the two companies which resulted in a realized gain on legal settlement and subsequent sale of related securities of 1961 million net of legal fees 

loss gain on investments net 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded a gain of 73 million primarily related to the sale of privately held investments during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded a gain of 1630 million related to the sale of investments which were converted from privatelyheld investments to publiclytraded equity upon initial public offering or ipo and subsequently sold 

income tax provision 

the following table presents the income tax provision in millions except percentages 



2016  compared to 2015   

the effective tax rate for the tax year 2016 was higher than 2015 primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings the effective tax rate for the tax year 2015 includes a benefit of 132 million related to a change in the tax treatment of sharebased compensation in our cost sharing arrangement 

as a result of recommendations by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd on base erosion and profit shifting beps certain countries in emea and apac have either enacted new corporate tax legislation or have indicated that they are considering enacting such legislation in the near future we expect the effect of these reform measures to potentially impact longstanding tax principles particularly in regards to transfer pricing consequently we expect global tax authorities to increasingly challenge our cost sharing and other intercompany arrangements and the related sourcing of taxable profits in global jurisdictions in 2016 we entered into discussions with the uk tax authorities and the australian tax authorities regarding corporate tax reform legislation enacted by those countries 

2015  compared to 2014   

the effective rate for the tax year 2015  was lower than 2014 primarily due to the income tax that was provided in 2014 on the nondeductible goodwill charge included in the pretax loss in addition the 2014 effective tax rate includes 528 million related to the gain on the sales of junos pulse offset by the release of the companys valuation allowance attributable to investment losses 

our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items see item 1a of part ii risk factors  of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results 

for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and further explanation of our income tax provision see note 14 income taxes  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities the issuance of our common stock and the issuance of our longterm debt the following table presents our capital resources in millions except percentages 



 

 

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable reduced by shortterm debt accounts payable and accrued liabilities working capital increased  by 11255 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to 11060 million of cash provided from our operating activities and 4940 million of proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt partially offset by 4771 million of payments for purchases and retirement of our common stock and cash dividends and payment of shortterm debt of 3000 million 

summary of cash flows 

as of december 31 2016  our cash and cash equivalents increased  by 4123 million  from december 31 2015  primarily due to cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 notes and 2024 notes partially offset by purchases and retirement of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program payment of our 2016 notes capital expenditures dividend payments payments for business acquisitions and net purchases of availableforsale investments 

the following table summarizes cash flows from our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions except percentages 

operating activities 

our primary source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnelrelated expenditures and other general operating expenses as well as payments related to taxes interest and facilities 

2016  compared to 2015   

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 2135 million  in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase was primarily due an increase in cash received from customers partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid 

 54 

2015  compared to 2014   

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 1291 million  in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase was primarily due to a decrease in cash payments for personnelrelated expenditures income tax paid in 2015 and an increase in cash received from customers partially offset by an increase in cash payments to suppliers 

investing activities   

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases sales maturities and redemptions and cash used for business combinations 

2016  compared to 2015   

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 586 million  in 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease was primary due to a decrease in net purchases of availableforsale investments partially offset by an increase in cash used for business acquisitions in 2016 

2015  compared to 2014   

net cash used in investing activities increased by 9427 million  in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase was primary due to lower net proceeds from availableforsale securities in 2015 compared to 2014 in 2014 the sale of availableforsale securities were higher in order to partially fund our accelerated share repurchase program in addition we completed our sale of junos pulse in 2014 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of purchases and retirement of common stock payment of cash dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of shortterm and longterm debt and proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans 

2016  compared to 2015   

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 3518 million  in 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease was primarily due to lower purchases and retirements of our common stock in 2016 partially offset by the payment of our 2016 notes and a decrease in cash proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt and the issuance of common stock in 2016 

2015  compared to 2014   

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 12428 million  in 2015 compared to 2014 the decrease was primarily due to lower purchases and retirement of our common stock in 2015 

capital return 

in february 2014 our board of directors which we refer to as the board approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to 21 billion  of our common stock including 12 billion  pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program or the stock repurchase program in october 2014 and july 2015 the board authorized a 13 billion  and 5000 million  increase respectively to the stock repurchase program for a total of 39 billion  as of december 31 2016  there was 2197 million  of authorized funds remaining under the stock repurchase program in february 2017 the board approved an incremental 5000 million stock repurchase authorization under the stock repurchase program 

 55 

the following table summarizes our stock repurchase activities in millions except per share amounts 



 

 

future stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 

in 2016  and 2015  we paid cash dividends of 010 per share each quarter totaling 1525 million  and 1563 million  per annum respectively the declaration and amount of any future cash dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors or an authorized committee thereof and will depend on our financial performance economic outlook and any other relevant considerations 

we completed our full commitment to return 41 billion of capital inclusive of share repurchases and dividends to stockholders by the end of 2016 beginning in 2017 we intend to return approximately 50 of annual free cash flow to our stockholders inclusive of share repurchases and dividends free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 

deferred revenue 

deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to shipments to distributors that have not sold through to endusers undelivered product commitments and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue deferred service revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services which include technical support hardware and software maintenance professional services and training 

the following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues in millions 



 56 

total deferred revenue increased  by 3130 million  to 14811 million  as of december 31 2016  compared to 11681 million  as of december 31 2015  primarily due to 1 an increase in deferred service revenue of 2304 million driven by an increase in multiyear support agreements which are billed in advance and 2 an increase in product deferred revenue primarily due to higher deferrals related to subscription and software revenue arrangements and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria in circumstances when costs are deferred deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however in the normal course of business we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and insurance programs see guarantees  below for additional information regarding our guarantees 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments debt and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 



 

 

as of december 31 2016  we had 2092 million  included in longterm income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes as a result this amount is not included in the table above 

revolving credit facility 

on june 27 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year 5000 million  unsecured revolving credit facility with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million  subject to certain conditions proceeds from borrowing made under the credit agreement may be used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until june 27 2019 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid 

the credit agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 30 x and an interest coverage ratio no less than 30 x during the term of the credit facility in addition the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants that limit or restrict our ability and that of our subsidiaries to among other things grant liens merge or consolidate dispose of all or substantially all of its assets change their accounting or reporting policies change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement and no amounts were outstanding see note 10 debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

 57 

guarantees 

we have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products solely or in combination with other third party products infringe the intellectual property rights of a thirdparty as of december 31 2016  we recorded 289 million  for such indemnification obligations in other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets we also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and insurance programs and guarantees related to thirdparty customerfinancing arrangements of 60 million  and 158 million  as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future additionally beginning in 2017 we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50 of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividends to the extent we repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or pay cash dividends on our common stock our liquidity may be impacted as of december 31 2016  87 of our cash cash equivalents and investment balances were held outside of the us which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 

in august 2016 we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec enabling us to offer for sale from time to time an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions our 2019 notes and 2024 notes were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement that we filed in august 2013 pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the sec on february 24 2016 our 2020 notes and 2025 notes were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the sec on february 26 2015 and our 3500 million in principal amount of our 2024 notes which form a single series and are fully fungible with our 2024 notes issued in 2016 were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to a prospectus filed with the sec on february 28 2014 any offerings of securities under our automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus in addition our revolving credit facility will also provide additional flexibility for future liquidity needs 

we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant for fiscal year 2016 we intended to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at 240 or less of our common stock outstanding on a pure share basis where each option rsu rsa or psa granted is counted as one share and each psa granted is counted based on target achievement based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options rsus rsas and psas we met this target for 2016 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations planned stock repurchases and dividends and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including but not limited to

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk   

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility in addition as of december 31 2016  87 of our cash cash equivalents and investments were held outside of the united states which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated our investments are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these investments are also reviewed to identify and evaluate indications of potential otherthantemporary impairments as discussed in note 4 cash equivalents and investments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

  

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  related to the sales of certain investments 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our availableforsale fixed income securities held as of 

december 31 2016  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 



these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points or bps 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts   

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other expense income net in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of eighteen months or less 

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro the indian rupee and the japanese yen approximately 73 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of eighteen months or less the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the year ended december 31 2016  in other expense income net on our consolidated statements of operations the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was a reduction to operating expenses of 11 for the year ended december 31 2016  

 60 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december 31 2016  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of nonus dollar cash cash equivalents and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10 movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on december 31 2016  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash cash equivalents and investments we would report in us dollars as of december 31 2016  by less than 1 

equity price risk   

our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities and our nonqualified deferred compensation “nqdc” plan which may also hold publiclytraded equity securities are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates 

we do not purchase our publiclytraded equity securities classified as availableforsale securities on our consolidated balance sheets for speculative purposes as of december 31 2016  our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities had an estimated fair value of 46 million  a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly traded equity securities would have no significant impact to the fair value of these investments 

investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2016  the total investments under our nqdc plan were 210 million  a hypothetical 30 adverse change on the total investments under our nqdc plan would have no significant impact to the fair value of these investments 

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies depending on the nature of these investments some can be carried at cost and others can be carried at fair value impairment charges on our investments in privatelyheld companies were 112 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  the aggregate cost of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 627 million  as of december 31 2016  the privatelyheld companies in which we invest can still be considered in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privatelyheld companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

establish and develop industry partnerships 

our customers have diverse requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders with diverse technologies and services that extend the value of the network to our customers these partnerships ensure that our customers have access to those technologies and services whether through technology integration joint development resale or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers requirements in addition we believe an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs 

markets and customers 

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales distributors valueadded resellers or vars and original equipment manufacturer or oem partners to endusers in the service provider and enterprise markets we believe the network needs for service providers such as telecom cable and cloud providers are converging as are those of national government financial services and enterprise strategic verticals as all of these customers focus on high performance networks and build cloud environments 

service providers 

service providers generally include wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers including those that provide social networking and search engine services we support most of the major service provider networks in the world and our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance reliability and security that service providers demand we believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our service provider customers by 

 

 

 

 

while many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline wireless or cable operators in recent years we have seen increased convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships we believe the convergence of offerings by service providers is facilitated by investment in the buildout of high performance networks and cloud environments 

we believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions these trends include significant growth in ip traffic on service provider networks because of peertopeer interaction broadband usage video an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our service provider customers and of their enterprise customers the advent of data center clouds that concentrate business applications in large ip network connected facilities network functions virtualization or nfv to allow more flexible deployment models and growth in mobile traffic as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including smartphones tablets and connected devices of all kinds 

the infrastructure market for service providers includes products and technology at the network core the network edge to enable access the aggregation layer the data center where many services are created security to protect from the inside out and the outside in the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs and the management service awareness and control of the entire infrastructure

enterprise 

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the worlds most demanding businesses the enterprise market generally is comprised of businesses federal state and local governments financial services and research and education institutions enterprises and public sector organizations such as governments and research and education institutions that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications in addition our solutions 

 

 

 

 

as with the service provider market innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market highperformance enterprises require ip networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance reliability and security with bestinclass open solutions for maximum flexibility we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers branch and campus applications as well as for distributed and extended enterprises 

customers 

in 2015  2014  and 2013  no  single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues 

products and technology   

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for servicerich platforms at the edge of the network was created 

we have expanded our portfolio to address domains in the network the core the edge access and aggregation data centers wide area networks or wans and campus and branch we have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon systems and software including our junos operating system virtualized network functions such as firewall as well as softwaredefined networks or sdn and automation software to provide a range of solutions in highperformance networking that can solve unique problems for our customers 

we conduct business globally and are managed operated and organized by major functional departments that operate on a consolidated basis as a result we operate in one reportable segment our product portfolio for highperformance networking is focused in three product areas routing switching and security in each of the past three fiscal years routing and switching each accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues security products accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal year 2014 and 2013 the following is an overview of our major product families in 2015 

routing products 

 

  6 

provide carrierclass performance scale and reliability to support largescale ethernet deployments in addition in 2014 we introduced the vmx  a virtual version of the mx router which is a true mx series 3d universal edge router optimized to run as software on x86 servers we believe that the vmx  helps service providers and enterprises quickly and economically address their requirements with carrierclass routing and a devops style servicefocus to the network

platform strategy   

in addition to our major product families our software portfolio has been a key technology element in our strategy to be the leader in highperformance networking 

our junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers the junos platform includes the following products 

 

 

 

 

 8 

junos os is designed to improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades this operational efficiency allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenuegenerating applications helping to advance the economics of highperformance networking 

the security and stability of junos os combined with its modular architecture and common source code base provides a foundation for delivering performance reliability security and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments with an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage junos os including routing switching and security products we believe junos os provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors 

 

 

significant product development projects   

in 2015  we continued to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio which resulted in new product offerings across routing switching and security in routing we expanded our acx series portfolio with the addition of acx500 and acx5000 routers enabling service providers to handle added capacity and accelerate service orchestration announced new line cards for the ptx3000 and ptx5000 expanded our converged supercore architecture with the addition of the ptx1000 a compact 3tbps fixed configuration core router enhanced the mx series 3d universal edge routing portfolio with new line cards and software features that triple throughput and enable network automation and introduced the nfx series the first in a planned series of network services platforms that can operate as secure onpremises devices running multiple vfns  from us and third parties  simultaneously thereby significantly reducing costs and giving service providers the ability to update network functions without having to purchase new hardware additionally we announced cloud cpe a fully automated endtoend nfv solution that builds on the proven ability of juniper networks contrail networking to scale across all nfv deployment models 

in switching we announced qfx10000 high performance data center switches which are powered by our new q5 chip a purposebuilt asic that we believe enables unprecedented performance port density and scale as well as the new junos fusion for data centers to provide industryleading network scale and automation capabilities for small to internetscale cloud networks we also announced a disaggregated version of our junos software to provide customers with ultimate choice in data center deployment options in addition we announced the qfx5200 line of access switches the first platform to run the disaggregated junos software as well as support the emerging 25 and 50 gigabit ethernet or gbe standard additionally we highlighted the rapid implementation of metafabric architecture and contrail sdn technologies across leading converged and hyperconverged stack solutions 

also juniper networks unite was announced a new campus architecture that provides simplified and secure network infrastructure solutions required to modernize enterprise campus and branch networks into cloudenabled service platforms additionally we announced junos fusion enterprise a new open architecture based on the 8021br industry standard that when combined with ex series ethernet switches we believe will enable the configuration and management of the entire distributed enterprise network as a single network entity

research and development 

we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols software applications and platforms and embedded operating systems as of december 31 2015  we employed 3723 people in our worldwide rd organization 

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications integrating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings in our products we are leveraging our software asic and systems technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers applications and continuing to develop technology to support the buildout of high performance networks and cloud environments we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

our rd process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our rd team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market expenditures for rd were 9945 million  10062 million  and 10432 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

sales and marketing 

as of december 31 2015  we employed 2464 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals systems engineers marketing teams channel teams and an operational infrastructure team are generally distributed between vertical markets within each team sales team members serve the following three geographic regions i americas including united states canada mexico caribbean and central and south america ii emea and iii apac within each region there are regional and country teams as well as vertical market focused teams to ensure we operate close to our customers 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below 

in north america and emea we sell to a select few service providers directly otherwise we sell to both service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers 

 10 

direct sales structure 

the terms and conditions of direct purchasing arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgment of those orders or by purchase contracts the direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

channel sales structure 

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales we utilize various channel partners including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

customer service 

in addition to our products we offer support professional and educational services we deliver these services directly to our channel partners and to endusers and utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and thirdparty organizations as appropriate 

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of support professional and educational services to ensure these services are locally delivered 

as of december 31 2015  we employed 1630  people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we employ support engineers consultants and educators with proven network experience to provide those services 

manufacturing and operations 

as of december 31 2015  we employed 337  people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our supply chain which include our contract manufacturers original design manufacturers subtier suppliers warehousing and logistics 

 11 

our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in the united states or us china malaysia mexico and taiwan as of december 31 2015  we utilized celestica incorporated flextronics international ltd accton technology corporation and alpha networks inc for the majority of our manufacturing activity our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement surface mount assembly final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required for our products to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

 

 

 

our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to agreedupon specifications products are then shipped to our distributors vars or endusers generally we do not own the components title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the contract manufacturers location customers take title to the products upon delivery at a specified destination if the product or components remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges 

our contracts with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer as applicable may accept purchase orders from us these contracts do not represent longterm commitments 

we also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical component supplies the majority of this inventory is production components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand 

some of our custom components such as asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs 

by working collaboratively with our suppliers we endeavor to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and throughout our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted a supplier code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers one element of our supplier code of conduct is adoption and compliance with the electronic industry code of conduct or the eicc the eicc outlines standards to promote ethical business practices eliminate human trafficking and ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe workers are treated with respect and dignity and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible our corporate citizenship report and supplier code of conduct are available on our website 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  our total product backlog was approximately 5174 million  and 4453 million  respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers generally within the next six months and excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sellthrough to endusers backlog also excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts 

 12 

seasonality 

we as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns historically we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

competition 

we compete in the network infrastructure markets these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer agility advantages in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc or cisco has historically been the dominant player however our principal competitors also include alcatellucent which merged with nokia corporation arista networks inc or arista brocade communications systems inc or brocade hewlett packard enterprise co or hp and huawei technologies co ltd or huawei 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco alcatellucent hp and huawei among others bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition marketing budgets and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

in addition there are a number of other competitors in the security space including palo alto networks inc or palo alto networks check point software technologies ltd or check point f5 networks inc or f5 networks fortinet inc or fortinet and hp among others who tend to be focused on single product line solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line 

in addition to established competitors a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco alcatellucent and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products further there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue 

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

environment   

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment or weee directive directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment or rohs and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals or reach regulations adopted by the european union and china to date compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however see the risk factor entitled regulation of industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects in the section entitled risk factors  in item 1a of part i of this report for additional information concerning rohs compliance 

we are also voluntarily participating in the cdp formerly the carbon disclosure project climate and water disclosures and encourage our direct material suppliers representing an aggregate of at least 80 of our consolidated total direct expenditure to do the same cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors and customers in fact in 2015 we achieved a position on cdp’s sp 500 climate disclosure leadership index and the sp 500 climate performance leadership index we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able 

 13 

to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis we believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world 

in addition we are committed to the environment through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency of key elements in our highperformance network product offerings with the launch of the ptx series we pioneered among other groundbreaking achievements record energy efficiency of 15w per gigabit of throughput since then we have continued to enhance the ptx series delivering marketleading energy efficiency of 12w per gigabit of throughput in 2014 and with our announcement in 2015 further improving energy efficiency of 05w per gigabit with the 3tbps fpc3 linecard in addition with our recent announcements for the mx series 3d universal edge routers we are delivering breakthrough energy efficiency of 08w per gigabit at the network edge breaking the 1w per gigabit barrier the environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business 

intellectual property   

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products and from time to time we license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2015  we had 2480 patents worldwide and numerous patent applications are pending patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

employees   

as of december 31 2015  we had 9058 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

investments in our securities involve significant risks even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered in the past significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors disclosed by us including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our business operating results and stock price 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

the factors that may cause our quarterly results to vary quarter by quarter and be unpredictable include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in the mix of products and services sold changes in the mix of geographies in which our products and services are sold changing market and economic conditions current and potential customer partner and supplier consolidation and concentration competition long sales and implementation cycles unpredictable ordering patterns changes in the amount and frequency of share repurchases or dividends regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example we and many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending particularly in the first quarter furthermore market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs issues with product quality regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations such adjustments may be difficult or impossible to execute in the short or medium term 

as a result of these factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some quarters our operating results will be below our guidance our longterm financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance 

a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and there is an ongoing trend toward consolidation in the industry in which our customers and partners operate any decrease in revenues from our customers or partners could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners particularly in our service provider market changes in the business requirements vendor selection project prioritization financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior including product mix purchased of our key customers could significantly decrease our sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in recent years there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example altice’s purchase of portugal telecom liberty globals proposed acquisition of cable  wireless communications att’s acquisition of directv and charter communications incs proposed acquisition of time warner cable inc and that consolidation trend has continued if our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay suspend or indefinitely reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or other direct or indirect unforeseen consequences could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or uncertainty customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to 

 17 

provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses in addition economic instability or uncertainty as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world have and may continue to put pressure on economic conditions which has led and could lead to reduced demand for our products to delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects andor higher costs of production more generallyspeaking economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore instability in the global credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the short and medium term therefore fluctuations in revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margins from quarter to quarter 

uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions 

in periods of market expansion we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in rd sales and marketing and other parts of our business conversely in 2014 to refocus the company’s strategy optimize its structure and improve operational efficiencies we implemented a new strategic focus realigned our organization into a onejuniper structure reduced our workforce consolidated and closed facilities made changes to enhance efficiency improved cost management measures and instituted a new capital allocation plan in connection with our cost management measures we implemented a substantial cost reduction plan accomplished through various restructuring activities across research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the underperformance of our security reporting unit and product rationalizations further strategyrelated pivots could lead to delays in achieving revenue and profit forecasts and result in additional impairment some of our expenses are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competition is intense in the markets that we serve the network equipment market has historically been dominated by cisco with competition coming from other companies such as alcatellucent arista brocade hp and huawei in the security market we face intense competition from cisco and palo alto networks as well as companies such as check point f5 networks fortinet and hp further a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition by or of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all for example in recent years nokia corporation merged with alcatellucent hp acquired aruba networks and cisco acquired opendns and sourcefire inc which further consolidated our market in addition dell announced a proposed acquisition of emc which we anticipate will further consolidate our market upon its consummation a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do in addition some of our competitors have become more integrated including through consolidation and offer a 

 18 

broader range of products and services which could make their solutions more attractive to our customers many of our competitors sell networking products as bundled solutions with other it products such as computer and storage systems if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our partners and resellers generally sell or resell competing products on a nonexclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete which could also adversely affect our business 

we expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time and the level of gross margins achieved by us in recent years may not be sustainable 

we expect our product and service gross margins to vary from quartertoquarter and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including customer product and geographic mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete currency fluctuations that impact our costs or the cost of our products and services to our customers increases in material labor or inventory carrying costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if we do not accurately forecast product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products and enhancements or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures for example in fiscal year 2014 our margins declined compared to fiscal year 2013 as a result of higher inventory charges resulting from product rationalizations and an industrywide memory product quality defect for a component from a third party we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

further we will continue to remain diligent in our longterm financial objective to increase revenue and operating margins and manage our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue we expect that our margins will vary with our ability to achieve these goals we can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve all of the goals of these plans or meet our announced expectations in whole or in part or that our plans will have the intended effect of improving our margins on the expected timeline or at all 

conversion of key internal systems and processes particularly our erp system and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with and therefore harm our business and operations 

we have underway a multiphase project to convert certain key internal systems and processes including our customer relationship management or crm system and enterprise resource planning or erp system since 2012 we have been implementing major changes to our erp system which activities we expect to continue into 2016 in the third quarter of 2014 we implemented the manufacturing fulfillment and inventory portion of this erp project and were reliant upon dual erp systems until january 2016 when we moved to a single erp system in connection with the transfer to our new erp system we scheduled a shutdown of certain of our legacy erp systems which may impact our dso andor our cash collections in the first quarter of 2016 we are still early in the process of operating under our new erp system and may need to resolve issues that arise in connection with this transition we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes any problems disruptions delays or other issues in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes particularly any that impact our operations could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide service and support to our customers bill and track our customers collect cash from our customers maintain our dso measure fulfill contractual obligations record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner recognize revenue file sec reports in a timely manner or otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects as noted above the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated and in the event of lengthy project delays we may experience issues with retention of the implementation team if we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more lengthy or costly than anticipated our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

a customers decision to purchase certain of our products particularly new products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very 

 19 

lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times both of which may be exacerbated by the impact of continued global economic weakness may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

the timing of product orders andor our reliance on revenue from sales of software or subscription and support and maintenance services may cause us to recognize revenue in a different period than the one in which a transaction takes place this may make it difficult for investors to observe quarterly trends and may cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin on a quarterly basis 

generally our network equipment products are stocked only in limited quantities by our distributors and resellers due to the cost complexity and custom nature of configurations required by our customers we generally build such products as orders are received the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter remains unpredictable if orders for certain products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter 

in addition services revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue comprising 27 26 and 25 of total revenue in fiscal year 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively sales of new or renewal support and maintenance contracts may decline andor fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors and reductions in our endcustomers’ spending levels we recognize support and maintenance revenue periodically over the term of the relevant service period 

the introduction of new software products is part of our intended strategy to expand our software business and software revenues may be recognized periodically over the term of the relevant use period or subscription period as a result much of the software subscription and support and maintenance revenue we report each fiscal quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from software subscription and support and maintenance contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed contracts in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our software subscriptions or support and maintenance is not reflected in full in our operating results until future periods also it is difficult for us to rapidly increase our software or services revenue through additional software or services sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal software subscription and support and maintenance contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

additionally we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

we rely on single or limited sources of certain of our components during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited any future spike in growth in our business or more likely in it spending and the economy in general is likely to create greater shortterm pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed for example from time to time we have experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of product shipments we currently purchase numerous key components including asics and other semiconductor chips from single or limited sources and many of our component suppliers are concentrated in china in addition there has been consolidation among certain suppliers of our components for example globalfoundries recently acquired ibm’s semiconductor manufacturing business avago technologies limited recently acquired broadcom corporation and intel corporation recently acquired altera corporation consolidation among suppliers can result in the reduction of the number of independent suppliers of components available to us which could negatively impact our ability to access certain 

 20 

component parts or the prices we have to pay for such parts any disruptions to our supply chain could decrease our sales earnings and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to increases in wages that drive up prices the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes on key components labor stoppages transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters civil unrest geopolitical developments war or terrorism and disruptions in utility and other services 

the development of alternate sources for key components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules also longterm supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may further increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

we rely on valueadded and other resellers as well as distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded and other reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm nokia solutions and networks oy dimension data and nec corporation the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products and some of which sell their own competing products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues for example in 2011 and 2012 one of our oem partners dell acquired force10 and sonicwall both competitors of ours as a result dell became increasingly competitive in certain areas their resale of our products declined and we ultimately terminated our oem relationship with dell in addition nokia corporation merged with alcatellucent a competitor of ours and cisco recently announced a partnership with ericsson which is one of our existing partners our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets fail to expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively determine that we cannot continue to do business with these partners for any reason or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and scale and improve our processes and procedures that support the channel as a result our programs processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage we have previously entered into oem agreements with partners pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the programs processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products we also depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks in addition we also store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy the growing cyber risk environment means that individuals companies and organizations of all sizes including us are increasingly subject to the threat of intrusions on their networks and systems by a wide range of actors on an ongoing and regular basis despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to penetration or attacks by computer programmers hackers or sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions if any breach compromises our networks creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost or stolen and we may be subject to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and suffer reputational and financial harm in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks this can be true even for “legacy” products that have been determined to have reached an end of life engineering status but will continue to operate for a limited amount of time 

for example in december 2015 we disclosed that we identified unauthorized code in our screenos security system that could allow a knowledgeable attacker to gain administrative access to netscreen devices and to decrypt vpn connections following the identification of the screenos vulnerabilities we launched an investigation into the matter developed patched releases for the latest versions of screenos and notified customers all of which required significant time and attention from management and our employees we also announced that we are making additional changes to screenos in response to our additional analysis and the investigation is ongoing at this time we do not have an estimate of third party costs related to the screenos matter that could result from any third party claims brought against us including for example indemnification for damages our customers may incur or actions instituted by governmental or regulatory entities that could result in fines or other penalties costs related to the screenos matter including the costs to resolve third party claims costs relating to the investigation and the time and resources required to develop patched releases and further modify the products may be material 

as a result of the screenos matter or any other actual or perceived breach of network security that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products and our overall reputation could be harmed because the techniques used by attackers many of whom are highly sophisticated and wellfunded to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques or the vulnerabilities they have caused this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions which could have an adverse impact on our financial results the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities including the screenos matter could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the attacker which are often difficult to pinpoint additionally we could be subject to regulatory investigations potential fines and litigation in connection with a security breach or related issue and be liable to third parties for these types of breaches 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers data center providers or other partners as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology or it systems the systems and processes of third parties and the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed for example although it did not adversely affect our shipments an earthquake in late december of 2006 disrupted our communications with china where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs in addition as discussed earlier in this risk factors  section beginning in 2012 and continuing into 2016 we have been implementing major changes to our erp system any failure of the new system or interruptions during the implementation process may impair communications with our manufacturers and therefore adversely affect our ability to build and ship our products 

 22 

we are also in the process of further consolidating our onsite data centers to the cloud and to offsite facilities that are hosted and controlled by thirdparties these cloud providers and offsite facilities are vulnerable to damage interruption or performance problems from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunications failures equipment failure adverse events caused by operator error and similar events in addition because we lease our cloud storage space and offsite data center facilities we cannot be assured that we will be able to expand our data center infrastructure to meet user demand in a timely manner or on favorable economic terms if we have issues receiving and processing data this may delay our ability to provide products and services to our customers and damage our business we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturers were not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us which prevented us from meeting our commitments to our customers if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies and our other large customers generally require onerous terms and conditions in our contracts with them as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

telecommunications cable and cloud service provider companies which comprise a significant portion of our customer base and other large companies generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and accordingly often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers for example our customers france telecomorange and deutsche telekom ag have formed a company for the purpose of purchasing products from and negotiating more favorable contractual terms with suppliers as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

in addition service providers have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased patent litigation brought against customers by nonpracticing entities in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in customers requesting or requiring vendors to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products product enhancements and business strategies that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available or strategies are not executed in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements continued price pressures and a constantly evolving industry we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future technological shifts market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet such technological shifts needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all for example the move from traditional network infrastructures towards softwaredefined networking or sdn has been receiving considerable attention in our view it will take several years to see the full impact of sdn and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine hardware and software elements if we fail to anticipate market requirements or opportunities or fail to develop and introduce new products product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products enhancements or business strategies there can be no assurance that new products enhancements or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance 

in the past two years we have announced a number of new hardware and software products across routing switching and security including acx5000 and acx500 routers qfx10000 line of spine switches qfx5100 qfx5100aa qfxpfa srx300 srx1500 srx5000 and srx5800 series services gateways ex9200 and ex4600 ethernet switches new mx series line cards and routers including the vmx 3d universal edge router new ptx series line cards powered by our expressplus custom

the introduction of new software products is part of our intended strategy to expand our software business we have also begun to disaggregate certain software from certain hardware products such that customers would be able to purchase or license our hardware and software products independently which we expect could in time enable our hardware to be deployed with third party networking applications and services and our software to be used with third party hardware for example we have developed a disaggregated version of our junos software and recently introduced our qfx5200 series of switches which runs our disaggregated junos software the success of our strategy to expand our software business including our strategy to disaggregate software from certain hardware products is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of our new products or business strategies do not gain market acceptance or meet our expectations for growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected and our competitive position and our business and financial results could be harmed 

we are a party to lawsuits investigations proceedings and other disputes which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay fines or damages undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors have been or are subject to various lawsuits we have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters commercial transactions and patent infringement as well as securities laws as noted in note 16 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this report under the heading of “legal proceedings” the us securities and exchange commission or the sec and the us department of justice or the doj are conducting investigations into possible violations by the company of the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa in a number of countries the investigations relate to whether the company or any third party on behalf of the company gave money or anything else of value to any government official in violation of the fcpa the company’s audit committee with the assistance of independent advisors has been investigating and conducting a thorough review of possible violations of the fcpa and has made recommendations for remedial measures including employee disciplinary actions in foreign jurisdictions which the company has implemented and continues to implement litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain we therefore cannot predict the duration scope outcome or consequences of litigation and government investigations in connection with any government investigations including those in which we are currently involved as described above if the government takes action against us or we agree to settle the matter we may be required to pay substantial fines and incur other sanctions which may be material and suffer reputational harm the lawsuits and investigations are expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

 24 

we are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights resolution of which may be time  consuming and expensive as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights in addition increased patent litigation brought by nonpracticing entities in recent years may result and in some cases has resulted in our customers requesting or requiring us to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies enter into license agreements or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us or anyone we are required to indemnify by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or if we license required proprietary rights our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

regulation of industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects 

we are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas for example some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria even though those criteria may be in conflict with accepted international standards other regulations that may negatively impact our business include country of origin regulations these types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements applicable to public companies regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries which we refer to collectively as the drc and procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals” these minerals are present in our products sec rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply drc “conflict free” components and parts and we may not be able to obtain drc conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products 

in addition environmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment may adversely impact our business and financial condition these laws and regulations include among others the european union or eu restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive or rohs the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products currently our products comply with the eu rohs requirements however certain exemptions are scheduled to lapse in the future including an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment upon which we and our competitors rely and which is currently scheduled to expire in july 2016 the lapse of this exemption further changes to this or other laws or passage of similar laws in the eu or other jurisdictions would require us to cease selling noncompliant products in the eu and to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us disrupt our operations or logistics and result in an adverse impact on our operating results in addition in validating the compliance of our products with applicable hazardous materials restrictions we rely substantially on affirmations by our component suppliers as to the compliance of their products with respect to those same restrictions failure by our component suppliers to furnish accurate and timely information could subject us to penalties or liability for violation of such hazardous materials restrictions interrupt our supply of products to the eu and result in our customers refusing or being unable to purchase our products additionally the eu and a number of other countries have adopted regulations requiring producers of electrical and electronic equipment to assume certain responsibilities for collecting treating recycling and disposing of products when they have reached the end of their useful life finally the eu reach regulations regulate the handling of certain chemical substances that may be used in our products

the traditional telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the internet telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks but future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the internet and internet service provider access charges we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service providers or cloud provider companies regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers needs for products for instance the us federal communications commission has issued regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks these regulations which are being challenged in court might impact service provider and cloud provider business models and as such providers needs for internet telecommunications equipment and services also many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security supply chain integrity privacy and data protection any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment 

the adoption and implementation of additional regulations could reduce demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products result in product inventory writeoffs impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner require us to spend significant time and expense to comply and subject us to fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues 

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls and restrictions on the import or export of among other things our products that contain or use encryption technology most of our products contain or use encryption technology and consequently are subject to such controls requirements and restrictions in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring certification notifications review of source code limiting the encryption features or the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys for example china recently has proposed new requirements relating to products containing encryption and india has imposed special warranty and other obligations associated with technology deemed critical governmental regulation of encryption or ip networking technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or export or related economic sanctions including recent restrictions imposed by the us and eu on exports to russia and ukraine could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in harm to our reputation and ability to compete in international markets penalties costs and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or governmentfunded projects 

our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a variety of state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these privacy and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development and offering of new products and services 

for example we historically have relied upon adherence to the us department of commerce’s safe harbor privacy principles and compliance with the useu safe harbor framework agreed to by the us department of commerce and the eu the useu safe harbor framework which established means for legitimizing the transfer of personal data by us companies from the european economic area or eea to the us recently was invalidated by a decision of the european court of justice or the ecj in light of the ecj’s decision we are reviewing our business practices and may find it necessary or desirable to make changes to our personal data handling procedures and contractual arrangements to ensure our transfer and receipt of eea residents’ personal data remains legitimized under applicable european law our actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect personal data could result in enforcement actions significant penalties or other legal action against us or our customers or suppliers which could result in negative publicity increase our operating costs subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 26 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

we are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill annually or more frequently if certain circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible assets below their carrying values as of december 31 2015  our goodwill was 29813 million  and there were no intangible assets with indefinite lives when the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill a charge to operations is recorded if the carrying amount of an intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value a charge to operations is recorded either event would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred 

in the past we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million  due to the underperformance of our security reporting unit and product rationalizations 

in recent years economic weakness has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours declines in our level of revenues due to restructuring or cost reductions or declines in our operating margins as well as sustained declines in our stock price increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives may become impaired in future periods 

our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis such as expected future cash flows the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets and our stock price if the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets however any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by the following earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement costs related to intercompany restructuring tax effects of sharebased compensation challenges to our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof on october 5 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development or oecd an international association of 34 countries including the us published final proposals under its base erosion and profit shifting or beps action plan the beps action plan includes fifteen actions to address beps in a comprehensive manner and represents a significant change to the international corporate tax landscape these proposals if adopted by countries may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service or irs and other tax authorities it is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes but the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made there can be no assurance that the outcomes from continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 27 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins for example in certain prior quarters our gross margins were reduced as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time and because our contract manufacturers are thirdparty manufacturers for numerous other companies if we underestimate our requirements as we have in certain prior quarters with respect to certain components our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products which could increase costs or delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues and negatively impacting customer satisfaction 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships which includes failing to provide accurate forecasts of our requirements or if one or more of them experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our ability to compete 

we generally rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology any of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings and other competitive harm 

in addition despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that the agreements we have entered into will not be breached we cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 

furthermore the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success 

 28 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and vars in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the united states in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic business regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the united states or in other countries in which we operate in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors channel partners and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in termination of our relationship financial reporting problems fines andor penalties for us or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

because a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro indian rupee and japanese yen related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars this could negatively affect our ability to meet our customers pricing expectations in those markets and may result in erosion of gross margin and market share a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities however such attempts to 

 29 

offset the impact of currency fluctuations are costly and no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances including longterm declines in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business for example in january 2016 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire bti systems inc in 2014 we acquired wandl inc and in 2012 we acquired contrail systems inc and mykonos software inc acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs and liabilities diversion of managements attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired business if we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders use a substantial portion of our cash resources assume liabilities record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

approximately 125 million of the transaction consideration we received from the divestiture of our junos pulse product portfolio is in the form of a noncontingent seller promissory note and we may not receive the amount owed to us including accrued interest including in the time frame contemplated by the buyer under the note 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed the sale of our junos pulse product portfolio to an affiliate of siris capital a private equity firm for total consideration of 2307 million  of which 1057 million  was in cash net of a 193 million  working capital adjustment and 1250 million  was in the form of an 18month noncontingent interestbearing promissory note issued to the company on october 2 2015 the company and the issuer of the promissory note agreed to modify the original terms of the note to extend the maturity date from april 1 2016 to december 31 2018 since approximately 1250 million  of the transaction consideration is in the form of a noncontingent seller promissory note there is the risk that we may not receive the amount owed to us including accrued interest including in the time frame contemplated by the buyer under the note in the event that the promissory note is not repaid on the terms we contemplate any collection or restructuring efforts we undertake may be costly and require significant time and attention from our management 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to effectively implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected defects errors or malware or do not meet customer quality expectations our business could be adversely affected and we may be subject to additional costs or lawsuits or be required to pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers for example in december 2015 we disclosed that we identified unauthorized code in screenos that could allow a knowledgeable attacker to gain administrative access to netscreen devices and to decrypt vpn connections 

 30 

any errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in monetary penalties loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and reputation penalties and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations following the identification of the screenos vulnerabilities we launched an investigation into the matter developed patched releases for the latest versions of screenos and notified customers all of which required significant time and attention from management and our employees in addition in the event an error defect malware or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty or indemnification defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed moreover if our products fail to satisfy our customers quality expectations for whatever reason the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or are not available on terms acceptable to us our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the failure to comply with the terms of any license including free open source software may result in our inability to continue to use such license some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them in addition we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us if possible to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the buildout of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when our customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 31 

we are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and publicly disclose material weaknesses in our controls any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception our stock price and cause us to incur additional expense 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented we have an ongoing program to implement and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section 404 compliance in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major credit rating agencies routinely evaluate our indebtedness this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

we may be unable to generate the cash flow to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our debt obligations including the senior notes and the revolving credit facility 

in march 2015 we issued 3000 million aggregate principal amount of 330 senior notes due 2020 which we refer to as the 2020 notes and 3000 million aggregate principal amount of 435 senior notes due 2025 which we refer to as the 2025 notes in addition in march 2014 we issued 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 450 senior unsecured notes due 2024 which we refer to as the 2024 notes and in march 2011 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes which we refer to as the senior notes and together with the 2020 notes 2024 notes and 2025 notes the notes see discussion in note 10 debt and financing  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report as of december 31 2015  we had 19487 million  in outstanding shortterm and longterm debt in june 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility which we refer to as the revolving credit facility with an option to increase the revolving credit facility up to a maximum of 7000 million the credit agreement will terminate in june 2019 at which point all amounts borrowed must be repaid as of december 31 2015  no amounts were outstanding under the credit agreement 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to satisfy our expenses make anticipated capital expenditures or service our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon our ability to pay our expenses satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance which will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control based upon current levels of operations we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon however if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt we may be required to sell assets reduce capital expenditures refinance all or a portion of our existing debt including the notes repatriate offshore cash to the us at unfavorable tax rates or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the indentures that govern the notes contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

 32 

the credit agreement contains two financial covenants along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following 

 

 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business a failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default in addition in the event of an acceleration we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments including those under the notes any notes issued in connection with the recentlyannounced capital return program discussed below and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon 

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

in january 2016 we announced a cash dividend of 010 per share of common stock payable on march 22 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 1 2016 our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors any failure to pay or increase future dividends as announced reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

in addition in july 2015 and october 2014 our board of directors authorized a 5000 million and a 11 billion increase respectively to our current capital return plan the capital return plan will be funded by a combination of onshore cash previously issued debt and potentially additional debt financing to preserve our financial flexibility to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain our investment grade credit rating any failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our shareholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at december 31 2015  we had 14209 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 17713 million  in short and longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in assetbacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities government sponsored enterprise obligations money market funds mutual funds publiclytraded equity securities time deposits and us government securities certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market sovereign debt and interest rate risks our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

business and market environment 

at juniper networks we design develop and sell products and services for highperformance networks to enable customers to build highly scalable reliable secure and costeffective networks for their businesses while achieving agility efficiency and value through automation we focus on customers and partners across our key market verticals who view these network attributes as fundamental to their business including telecom cable providers cloud providers national government financial services and enterprise strategic verticals we believe that product and solution differentiation with a relentless customer focus will enable us to achieve our goal of growing our revenue faster than the market 

our products are sold in three geographic regions americas europe middle east and africa or emea and asia pacific or apac our highperformance routing switching and security networking products and service offerings are sold to service provider and enterprise markets we believe that our silicon systems and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking helping our customers achieve superior performance greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership in addition to our products we offer technical support and professional services as well as education and training programs to our customers together our highperformance product and service offerings help our customers convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation value and increased performance reliability and security to endusers 

our fiscal 2015 results showed improvement with yearoveryear net revenue increases across all verticals and geographies and solid growth in our routing switching and highend srx platforms and security software products as anticipated in the second half of 2015 us telecom showed an improvement in net revenues compared to the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014 of our top ten customers for fiscal 2015 five were telecom customers three of which were outside of the us and five were cloud and cable providers we expect the overall revenue environment to be challenging in the nearterm as market dynamics may impact demand from some of our customers we also anticipate the exchange rate of the us dollar to other currencies to remain strong further we believe our product gross margins may continue to vary in the future due to competitive pricing pressures which may be offset by additional operational efficiencies 

nevertheless we are focused on executing our strategy which is focused on designing developing and selling products and services for highperformance networks we believe our product portfolio continues to be strong and we remain focused on operational excellence cost discipline targeted growth initiatives as well as partnerships and tuckin acquisitions that complement our rd strategy for example in january 2016 we announced our intent to acquire optical equipment provider bti systems which we believe will allow us to accelerate the delivery of open and automated packet optical transport solutions with integrated network management based on bti systems pronx service manager and our connectivity services director as well as northstar controller we believe that together these products provide a unified management interface for multilayer provisioning of endtoend services across ip and optical networks 

further our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operation of networks and to allow our customers across our key verticals to deliver real value over those networks we anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue over time

financial results and key performance metrics overview   

the following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions except per share amounts percentages days sales outstanding or dso and booktobill 



 

 

 

during 2014 net revenues were slightly down compared to 2013 as a result of a decline in net revenues from us carriers partially offset by growing demand from cloud providers in the americas as well as improving demand among service provider in emea the yearoveryear decline in our net revenues was primarily due to a decrease in net revenues from our routing and security products partially offset by an increase in our switching products revenue and service revenue 

 

our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased during 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of higher inventory charges driven by product rationalizations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan and charges related to an industrywide memory product quality defect for a component from a third party supplier 

 41 

 

during 2014 compared to 2013 we experienced a decline in operating income loss as a percentage of net revenues primarily due to an 8500 million goodwill impairment charge related to the security reporting unit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 restructuring and other charges of 2077 million related to severance facility consolidations and closures asset writeoffs and contract terminations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan as well as a component remediation charge of 207 million relating to the memory product quality defect 

 

during 2014 we declared two quarterly cash dividends of 010 per share payable on september 23 2014 and on december 23 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on september 2 2014 and december 2 2014 respectively in the aggregate amount of 860 million we had not previously paid cash dividends 

 

during 2014 we repurchased approximately 961 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of 2341 per share for an aggregate purchase of 22500 million 

 

operating cash flows decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower cash collections from customers higher payments primarily related to our 2014 restructuring plans higher taxes paid and lower prepayments compared to prior year 

 

dso for the quarter ended december 31 2014 increased by 8 days or 20 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2013 during 2014 we transitioned certain distribution partners from a third party financing program to junipers commercial payment terms going forward we expect dso to be in the range of 45 to 55 days 

 

 

as of december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 total deferred revenue increased by 64 million primarily due to an increase in deferred service revenue of 258 million primarily driven by the execution of several multiyear support agreements and annual agreement renewals the increase in deferred service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in deferred product revenue of 194 million as a result of lower distributor inventory and multiple revenue releases in relation to previously deferred product revenue

critical accounting policies and estimates   

the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our significant accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

 

goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination or an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recorded the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of november 1 st  or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment level by comparing the reporting units carrying value including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating results of the component 

the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test various factors are considered in the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions financial performance or a sustained decrease in share price if as a result of the qualitative assessment it is deemed more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount management will perform the quantitative test 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test if necessary involves a twostep process to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the first step tests for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units with the reporting unit’s net asset values if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting units does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the second step requires an assignment of the reporting unit’s fair value to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities using the relevant acquisition accounting guidance to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill and if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

in the first step the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using both the income and market valuation approaches we believe the income approach and the market approach are equally representative of the reporting unit’s fair value under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated 

 43 

future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publiclytraded companies in similar lines of business in the application of the income and market valuation approaches we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units and then apply a control premium which is determined by considering control premiums offered as part of the acquisitions that have occurred in market segments that are comparable with our reporting units the income approach and the market approach are equally weighted to derive the fair value of the reporting unit 

prior to the second step the longlived assets such as property plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if needed an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 

in the second step the reporting units fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets such as existing technology backlog and customer relationships in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates customer renewal rates and technology obsolescence rates used in valuing intangible assets and pricing of comparable transactions in the market in valuing the tangible assets 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value we considered macroeconomic factors including the economic growth general macroeconomic trends and growth for the markets in which the reporting units operate changes in the industry environment and the performance of market competitors in addition to these macroeconomic factors among other things we considered the reporting units’ current results and forecasts any changes in the nature of the business any changes in cost factors any significant legal regulatory contractual or other business factors and changes in the carrying amount of net assets 

as a result of our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that our goodwill was not impaired and we did not need to perform a quantitative assessment 

refer to item 8 of part ii note 7 goodwill and purchased intangible assets  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory 

 44 

into consideration when determining the liability as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  our contract manufacturer liabilities were 180 million  and 253 million respectively 

significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory and obsolete material exposures we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and contract manufacturer liabilities which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 

 

under our revenue recognition policies we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe if available thirdparty evidence or tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles when determining esp we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years 

 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules in addition the oecd’s recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles if adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes significant judgment 

 45 

is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

results of operations 

we sell our highperformance networking products and service offerings across routing switching and security to two primary markets service provider and enterprise our determination of the market to which a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customers industrial classification code but may also include subjective factors such as the intended use of the product the service provider market generally includes wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers including those that provide social networking and search engine services the enterprise market generally is comprised of businesses federal state and local governments research and education institutions and financial services 

the following table presents product and service net revenues in millions except percentages 



2015  compared to 2014   

routing product net revenues increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  as a result of an increase from cloud providers cable and telecom in emea and apac during 2015 we saw a strong increase in demand from both service provider and enterprise markets for our routing products as well as an overall increase in net revenues from our mx960 mx2020 and ptx series products 

switching product net revenues increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to data center buildouts with telecom and cloud providers this result was enabled by the significant growth with the qfx product family additionally we saw solid 

 46 

strength in switching net revenues in the americas and apac which was slightly offset by a decrease in emea we also saw a yearoveryear increase in the service provider market for our switching products 

security product net revenues decreased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to the divestiture of our junos pulse product lines and a continuing decline in our screenos products which was partially offset by an increase in sales of our srx platform and security software yearoveryear additionally we also saw a decrease in security net revenues within the enterprise market which was partially offset by a slight increase in the service provider market 

the increase  in service net revenues in 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewals service revenues are largely correlated with product revenues therefore if product net revenues decline it can have an impact on future service revenues 

2014  compared to 2013   

routing product net revenues decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of weaker demand for core routing products partially offset by strong growth of our ptx series products edge routing net revenues increased as a result of strong demand for our mx series products partly offset by older edge routing platforms the yearover year decline was driven by weakness from large us carriers partially offset by strength from cloud providers 

switching product net revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting growth from both our qfabric system and our ex series products during 2014 we saw strong adoption of qfabric data center switches by a growing number of customers with especially strong demand from cloud providers in the americas 

security product net revenues decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a continuing decline in our legacy screenos products and the divestiture of our junos pulse product lines sales of our srx platform declined slightly yearoveryear due to lower demand from us carrier customers 

the increase in service revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewals 

net revenues by geographic region 

the following table presents net revenues by geographic region in millions except percentages 



2015  compared to 2014   

net revenues in the americas increase d in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to a strong increase in net revenues from both the service provider and enterprise markets the increase in both the service provider and enterprise markets within the americas was due to an increase in net revenues across routing switching and srx product net revenues as well as service net revenues in addition we saw a strong increase in net revenues from cloud providers cable and enterprise partially offset by telecom 

 47 

net revenues in emea increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to an increase in net revenues from telecom and cloud providers slightly offset by a decrease in the enterprise market 

net revenues in apac increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to an increase in net revenues from telecom and cloud providers we experienced a significant decline in china which was partially offset by an increase in net revenues in japan and australia 

2014  compared to 2013 

net revenues in the americas increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in net revenues from service provider markets partially offset by a decline in the enterprise market the increase in net revenues in the service provider market was due to strong demand from cloud providers and cable partially offset by a decrease in demand from carriers the decline in the enterprise market resulted from a decline in net revenues due to recognition of revenue from a large us federal government contract in 2013 

net revenues in emea slightly increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to stronger demand from service providers partially offset by a decrease in net revenues from the enterprise market although demand from the public sector remained strong 

net revenues in apac decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a decline in net revenues from both the service provider and enterprise market 

net revenues by market and customer 

the following table presents net revenues by market in millions except percentages 



2015  compared to 2014 

net revenues from the service provider market increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  with growth from cloud providers telecom in emea and apac and cable within the service provider market we saw strength across routing switching and security with the largest increase in net revenues from routing revenue 

net revenues from the enterprise market increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to strength in service and routing and to a lesser extent switching which was partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue from our security products net revenues in the americas from the enterprise market increased across routing switching and srx security 

2014  compared to 2013 

net revenues from the service provider market increased in 2014 compared to 2013 with growth in the americas and emea the increase in service provider net revenues in the americas was driven by increased revenues from cloud providers and cable partially offset by decreased revenues from large carriers the increase in service provider net revenues in emea was attributable to growth with large carriers while in apac net revenues in the service provider market declined as a result of lower demand with both small and large carriers in addition service provider demand for switching products continued to be strong 

net revenues from the enterprise market decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a decline in sales in all geographic regions however revenue demand from public sector customers was higher for all three regions 

 48 

customer 

no customer accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during the year ended december 31 2015  2014 and 2013 

gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



our gross margins have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the mix and average selling prices of our products and services new product introductions and enhancements manufacturing costs expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations cost of support and service personnel and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 

2015  compared to 2014   

product gross margin increased  as a percentage of product net revenues in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to a decrease in product cost of revenues the decrease in cost of revenues is attributable to the nonrecurrence of restructuring charges recorded in 2014 for asset writedowns no such charges were incurred in 2015 excluding these components from prior year cost of sales yearoveryear gross margin would remain relatively consistent 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  services delivery costs increased at a slower rate than service revenue as a result of better labor efficiency and improved product quality 

2014  compared to 2013   

product gross margin decreased as a percentage of product net revenues in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in cost of revenues the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to asset writedowns of 415 million for product rationalizations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan and 207 million in connection with an industrywide memory product quality defect in a component from a thirdparty supplier excluding the costs of the restructuring and component defect product gross margin as a percentage of net revenues improved slightly primarily due to the favorability in product mix in the 2014 period 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in labor and logistics delivery costs to support new contracts and product introductions

research and development expense decreased  in 2015  compared to 2014  as a result of lower headcount headcount declined from an average of 3888 in 2014 to 3724 in 2015 leading to a reduction in payroll costs and stock based compensation in addition outside consulting services decreased due to reduced consulting expenses which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense on rd equipment and bonus expense 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense decreased  in 2015  compared to 2014  average headcount increased from 2360 in 2014 to 2446 in 2015 however the mix of employees hired in 2015 was significantly different to 2014 which resulted in lower salary and bonus expense additionally commissions expense decreased compared to 2014 as a result of the elimination of certain commission programs and a reduction in sales staff 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense decreased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of higher litigation and investigation related costs incurred in 2014 in connection with the investigations into possible violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and to a lesser extent our patent litigation case with palo alto networks additionally we saw a decrease in general and administrative consulting fees which was slightly offset by a higher bad debt expense amount 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges decreased  in 2015  compared to 2014  due to higher charges recorded in 2014 in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan during 2014 we implemented the 2014 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of 1662 million related to workforce reductions contract terminations project cancellations and facility closures the 2014 restructuring plan has been substantially completed as of december 31 2014 

 50 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded 04 million  of severance costs and a benefit of 10 million  for facilities that were recorded in restructuring and other benefits charges in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the 2014 restructuring plan see note 9  restructuring and other charges  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our restructuring activities 

impairment of goodwill

2014  compared to 2013   

research and development 

research and development expense decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower personnelrelated expenses as a result of restructuring actions and divestiture of our junos pulse product lines rd headcount decreased 8 from 4135 as of december 31 2013 to 3797 as of december 31 2014 the decrease in rd personnel expense was partially offset by higher sharebased compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of wandl inc in the first quarter of 2014 and engineering program costs in 2014 compared to 2013 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower personnelrelated expenses and other discretionary expenses due to our cost reduction efforts and creating efficiency in our sales activities the decrease in personnelrelated expenses was primarily due to headcount reductions sales and marketing headcount decreased 11 from 2626 as of december 31 2013 to 2348 as of december 31 2014 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher litigation and investigation related costs incurred in the current period in connection with investigation into possible violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and to a lesser extent our patent litigation case with palo alto networks as well as other litigation matters this increase was partially offset by personnelrelated expenses as a result of headcount reductions of 8 from 513 as of december 31 2013 to 470 as of december 31 2014 our patent litigation with palo alto networks was settled in 2014 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher charges recorded in 2014 in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan during 2014 we implemented the 2014 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of 1662 million related to workforce reductions contract terminations project cancellations and facility closures the 2014 restructuring plan has been substantially completed as of december 31 2014 and we do not expect to record significant future charges see note 9 restructuring and other charges  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our restructuring activities 

impairment of goodwill 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we began to implement a new security strategy focused on network resiliency and performance based on the srx platform as a result we rationalized our security product portfolio including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products including the divestiture of junos pulse these factors decreased our short term and near term revenue and profitability forecasts of the security reporting unit during our fiscal year 2014 annual goodwill impairment test the carrying value of our security reporting units goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in part ii item 8 of this report see note 7 goodwill and purchased intangibles  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on the impairment of goodwill

2015  compared to 2014   

sharebased compensation expense decreased  in 2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in expense was primarily related to a decline in actual shares vested 

2014  compared to 2013   

sharebased compensation expense remained consistent in 2014 compared to 2013 an increase in expense related to rsus rsas and psas assumed in connection with our acquisition of wandl in 2014 and an increase in grant date fair values due to higher stock prices was offset by a decrease in actual shares vested 

other expense income net and income tax provision

 52 

2015  compared to 2014   

interest income 

interest income increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to a higher balance of longer term investments yielding higher interest as well as a full year of interest income on the pulse note receivable 

interest expense 

interest expense increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to the issuance of our 2020 and 2025 notes in the first quarter of 2015 see note 10 debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2020 and 2025 notes 

gain on legal settlement 

during the year ended december 31 2015  no litigationrelated gains were recorded while in 2014 we entered into a settlement agreement with palo alto networks resolving patent litigation between the two companies which resulted in a realized gain on legal settlement and subsequent sale of related securities of 1961 million  net of legal fees

interest income 

interest income increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a higher balance of longer term investments yielding higher interest 

interest expense 

interest expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the issuance of our 2024 notes in the first quarter of 2014 see note 10 debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2024 notes

during the year ended december 31 2014 we entered into a settlement agreement with palo alto networks resolving patent litigation between the two companies which resulted in a realized gain on legal settlement and subsequent sale of related securities of 1961 million net of legal fees 

gain on investments

gain on sale of junos pulse 

the sale of our junos pulse product portfolio was completed on october 1 2014 and we recorded a gain of 196 million in other expense income net in the consolidated statement of operations this sale was driven by product rationalization in connection with our initiative to focus on projects with the highest potential for growth see note 8 other financial information  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on the sale junos pulse 

 53 

income tax provision 

the effective rate for 2015  was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the benefit of the federal rd tax credit a change in the tax treatment of sharebased compensation in the cost sharing arrangement which resulted from a us tax court opinion as discussed in note 14 income taxes  recognition of domestic production activities deductions and earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates the passage of protecting americans from tax hike act of 2015 on december 18 2015 retroactively and permanently reinstated the us federal rd tax credit effective january 1 2015 

the effective rate for 2014  differs from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of the nondeductible goodwill charge and tax gain on sale of junos pulse offset by the benefit from release of the company’s valuation allowance attributable to investment losses the federal rd tax credit recognition of domestic production activities deductions and earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates the passage of tax increase prevention act of 2014 on december 19 2014 retroactively reinstated the us federal rd tax credit from january 1 2014 to december 31 2014    

our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items see item 1a of part ii risk factors  of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results 

for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and further explanation of our income tax provision see note 14 income taxes  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities the issuance of our common stock and the issuance of our longterm debt the following table shows our capital resources in millions except percentages 



 

 

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable reduced by shortterm debt accounts payable accrued liabilities and shortterm deferred revenue working capital decreased  by 1867 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  primarily due to reclassification of longterm debt to shortterm debt as well as dividend payments capital expenditures and interest paid on debt partially offset by the issuance of the 2020 notes and the 2025 notes in march 2015 

 54 

summary of cash flows 

as of december 31 2015  our cash and cash equivalents decreased  by 2187 million  from december 31 2014  primarily due to higher capital expenditures dividend payout and higher interest paid on debt which was partially offset by the issuance of our 2020 and 2025 notes 

the following table summarizes cash flows from our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions except percentages 



operating activities 

2015  compared to 2014   

net cash provided by operating activities was 8925 million  in 2015 compared to 7634 million  in 2014 the increase of 1291 million  is primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating margin 

2014  compared to 2013   

cash flow from operations was 7634 million  in 2014 compared to 8459 million  in 2013 the decrease of 825 million is primarily due to lower cash collections from customers higher payments related to our restructuring plans higher taxes paid and lower prepayments compared to prior year 

investing activities 

2015  compared to 2014   

net cash used in investing was 5087 million  in 2015  compared to net cash provided by investing of 4340 million  in 2014  the decrease  of 9427 million  in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of availableforsale securities in 2015 compared to 2014 in 2014 the sale of availableforsale securities were higher in order to partially fund our accelerated share repurchase program we also received higher proceeds from the sale of certain publicly traded equity securities and proceeds from the sale of junos pulse in 2014 which was partially offset by higher cash payments to purchase availableforsale investments 

2014  compared to 2013 

net cash provided by investing was 4340 million in 2014 compared to net cash used in investing of 5610 million in 2013 the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to higher proceeds from sale of investments and fewer purchases of investments as well as proceeds received from the sale of junos pulse 

financing activities 

2015  compared to 2014 

net cash used in financing activities was 5814 million  in 2015 compared to 18242 million  in 2014 the decrease of 12428 million  was due to lower purchases and retirement of our common stock during fiscal 2015 

 55 

2014  compared to 2013 

net cash used in financing activities was 18242 million  in 2014 compared to 4017 million  in 2013 the increase of 14225 million is primarily due to higher purchases and retirement of our common stock and payment of cash dividends partially offset by the issuance of the 2024 notes 

stock repurchase activities 

in february 2014 our board of directors which we refer to as the board approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to 21 billion  of our common stock including 12 billion  pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program or the 2014 stock repurchase program in october 2014 and july 2015 the board authorized a 13 billion  and 5000 million  increase respectively to the 2014 stock repurchase program for a total of 39 billion  as of december 31 2015  there was 5325 million  of authorized funds remaining under the 2014 stock repurchase program 

the following table summarizes our stock repurchase activities in millions except per share amounts 



 

 

future stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements see note 18 subsequent events in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 part ii of this report for discussion of our stock repurchase activity subsequent to december 31 2015  

dividends 

during 2015  we declared four  quarterly cash dividends of 010  per share of common stock on january 27 2015 april 23 2015 july 23 2015 and on october 22 2015 which were paid on march 24 2015 june 23 2015 september 22 2015 and on december 22 2015 respectively to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 3 2015 june 2 2015 september 1 2015 and december 1 2015 respectively in the aggregate amount of 1563 million  

during 2014 we declared two quarterly cash dividends of 010 per share of common stock or 860 million on july 22 2014 and october 23 2014 which were paid on september 23 2014 and december 23 2014 respectively to stockholders of record as of the close of business on september 2 2014 and december 2 2014 respectively any future dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates are subject to approval by our board or an authorized committee thereof see note 18 subsequent events  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on our dividend declaration subsequent to december 31 2015

restructuring 

as of december 31 2015  our restructuring liability was 28 million  related to facility closures expected to be paid through march 2018 see note 9 restructuring and other charge s in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on our restructuring plans 

deferred revenue 

deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to shipments to distributors that have not sold through to endusers undelivered product commitments and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue deferred service revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services which include technical support hardware and software maintenance professional services and training 

the following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues in millions 



as of december 31 2015  net deferred product revenue increased   147 million  to 2403 million  compared to 2256 million  as of december 31 2014  primarily as a result of an increase in channel inventory and subscription deferrals as of december 31 2015  the increase  in deferred service revenue of 777 million  was primarily driven by timing of service contract renewals 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however in the normal course of business we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance guarantees related to thirdparty customerfinancing arrangements customs and duties guarantees and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities see guarantees  below and note 16 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our guarantees 

 57 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments debt and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 



 

1 see note 16 commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our contractual commitments 

2  see note 10  debt and financing in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our debt 

3 the future minimum lease payment is related to the data center lease agreement that we entered in to on july 10 2015 see note 16 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further explanation on the data lease agreement 

as of december 31 2015  we had 1873 million  included in longterm income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes as a result this amount is not included in the table above 

revolving credit facility 

on june 27 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year 5000 million  unsecured revolving credit facility with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million  subject to certain conditions proceeds from borrowing made under the credit agreement may be used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until june 27 2019 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid 

the credit agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 30 x and an interest coverage ratio no less than 30 x during the term of the credit facility in addition the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to among other things grant liens merge or consolidate dispose of all or substantially all of its assets change their accounting or reporting policies change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type as of december 31 2015  the company was in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement and no amounts were outstanding see note 10 debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

guarantees 

we have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products solely or in combination with other third party products infringe the intellectual property rights of a thirdparty as of december 31 2015 we recorded a 150 million liability for such indemnification obligations in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets we also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance guarantees related to thirdparty customerfinancing arrangements custom and duty guarantees and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities under certain thirdparty customer financing arrangements that contain guarantee provisions which have terms of up to four years we are liable for the aggregate unpaid payments to the thirdparty financing company in the event of customer default as of december 31 2015  we have not made any payments under these arrangements as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  we had 158 million  and 262 million  respectively in financing guarantees 

 58 

bank guarantees and standby letters of credit related to these financial guarantees of which 99 million  in financing guarantees was recorded in other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2015  

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future additionally in 2014 we indicated that we intend to return 41 billion to our stockholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends from february 2014 through the end of 2016 to the extent we repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or pay cash dividends on our common stock our liquidity may be impacted as of december 31 2015 94 of our cash cash equivalents and investment balances were held outside of the us which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 

in august 2013 we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec enabling us to offer for sale from time to time an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions our 2020 notes and 2025 notes were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the sec on february 26 2015 to the automatic shelf registration statement and our 2024 notes were issued under the automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to a prospectus filed with the sec on february 28 2014 any other offerings of securities under the automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus in addition our revolving credit facility will also provide additional flexibility for future liquidity needs 

we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant for fiscal year 2015 we intended to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at 250 or less of our common stock outstanding on a pure share basis where each option rsu rsa or psa granted is counted as one share based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options rsus rsas and psas we met this target for 2015 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations planned stock repurchases and dividends and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including but not limited to

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk   

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility in addition as of december 31 2015  94 of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the united states which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated our marketable securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these investments are also reviewed to identify and evaluate indications of potential otherthantemporary impairments as discussed in note 4 cash equivalents and investments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

  

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  related to the sales of certain investments 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our availableforsale fixed income securities held as of december 31 2015  and 2014  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 





these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

 60 

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts   

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other expense income net in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of one year or less 

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen approximately 78 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively in other expense income net on our consolidated statements of operations the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was a reduction to operating expenses of 23 21 and 08 in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december 31 2015  and as of december 31 2014  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of nonus dollar cash cash equivalents and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10 movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in us dollars as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  by less than 1 and by less than 12 respectively 

equity price risk   

our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities and our nonqualified deferred compensation “nqdc” plan which may also hold publiclytraded equity securities are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates 

we do not purchase our publiclytraded equity securities classified as availableforsale securities on our consolidated balance sheets for speculative purposes as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities had an estimated fair value of 88 million  and 20 million  respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our publiclytraded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair value of 26 million and 07 million as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively 

investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  the total investments under our nqdc plan were 177 million  and 163 million  respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change on the total investments under the nqdc plan would result in a loss in the fair value of 53 million and 49 million as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively 

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies depending on the nature of these investments some can be carried at cost and others can be carried at fair value in 2015  there were no impairment charges on our investments in privatelyheld companies and in 2014  and 2013  we recorded impairment charges of 11 million  and 28 million  respectively on our investments in privatelyheld companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in note 5 fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report the aggregate cost of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 1024 million  and 899 million  as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively

maintain and extend technology leadership 

we are recognized around the world as a leader in networking innovation our junos os applicationspecific integrated circuit “asic” technology and networkoptimized product architecture were key elements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership 

leverage position as supplier of highperformance network infrastructure 

from inception we have focused on designing developing and building highperformance network infrastructure for the worlds most demanding networking environments we consistently deliver groundbreaking leading technologies that transform the economics and experience of networking—significantly improving customer economics by lowering the capital expenditures required to build networks and the operating expenses required to manage and maintain them we believe that many customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors and that the scale performance reliability and security of our products will provide us with a competitive advantage which is critical to be selected as one of those vendors 

  

be a strategic partner to our customers 

in developing our solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build bestinclass products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers which has enabled us to design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date we plan to continue to work with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as to design products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace while enabling customers to reduce costs we are committed to investing in research and development at a level that drives our innovation agenda enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers 

enable new internet protocol ipbased services   

our platforms have enabled network operators to quickly build and secure networks costeffectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products by enabling new ipbased services we have broadened our service provider business over the last several years while also expanding our presence in the enterprise market 

establish and develop industry partnerships 

our customers have diverse requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders with diverse technologies and services that extend the value of the network to our customers these partnerships ensure that our customers have access to those technologies and services whether through technology integration joint development resale or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers requirements in addition we believe an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs 

markets and customers   

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturer “oem” partners to endusers in the service provider and enterprise markets we believe the network needs for service providers such as carriers wireless and wireline cable content and cloud service companies are converging as are those of large enterprises and national governments as all of these customers focus on high performance networks and build cloud environments 

 4 

service providers   

service providers generally include wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers including those that provide social networking and search engine services we support most of the major service provider networks in the world and our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance reliability and security that service providers demand we believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our service provider customers by 

 

 

   

 

while many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline wireless or cable operators in recent years we have seen increased convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships we believe the convergence of offerings by service providers is facilitated by investment in the buildout of high performance networks and cloud environments 

we believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions these trends include significant growth in ip traffic on service provider networks because of peertopeer interaction broadband usage video an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our service provider customers and of their enterprise customers the advent of data center clouds that concentrate business applications in large ip network connected facilities and growth in mobile traffic as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including smartphones tablets and connected devices of all kinds 

the infrastructure market for service providers includes products and technology at the network core the network edge to enable access the aggregation layer the data center where many services are created security to protect from the inside out and the outside in the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs and the management service awareness and control of the entire infrastructure 

enterprise   

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the worlds most demanding businesses the enterprise market generally is comprised of businesses federal state and local governments financial services and research and education institutions enterprises and public sector organizations such as governments and research and education institutions that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications in addition our solutions 

 

 

 

 

 5 

as with the service provider market innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market highperformance enterprises require ip networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance reliability and security with bestinclass open solutions for maximum flexibility we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers branch and campus applications distributed and extended enterprises 

customers 

in 2014 and 2013 no  single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues in 2012 verizon communications inc verizon accounted for 103  of our net revenues 

products and technology   

  

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created 

we have expanded our portfolio to address domains in the network the core the edge access and aggregation data centers wans and campus and branch we have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon systems and software both our junos os as well as sdn and automation software to provide a range of solutions in highperformance networking that can solve unique problems for customers 

our focus on highperformance networking leads to focus in three product areas routing switching and security in each of the past three fiscal years sales of our routing switching and security products each accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues the following is an overview of our major product families in 2014

platform strategy   

  

in addition to our major product families our software portfolio has been a key technology element in our strategy to be the leader in highperformance networking 

our junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers the junos platform includes the following products 

   

 

 

   

junos os is designed to improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades this operational efficiency allows network administrators more time to 

 7 

innovate and deliver new revenuegenerating applications helping to advance the economics of highperformance networking 

the security and stability of junos os combined with its modular architecture and common source code base provides a foundation for delivering performance reliability security and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments with an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage junos os including routing switching and security products we believe junos os provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors 

 

 

significant product development projects   

in 2014 we continued to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio which resulted in new product offerings across routing switching and security in routing we announced a virtualized version of our flagship mx series 3d universal edge routing platform the vmx 3d universal edge router to deliver the industrys first fullfeatured carriergrade virtualized router the vmx 3d gives service providers and enterprises the ability to seamlessly leverage the benefits of both virtual and physical networking

research and development 

  

we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols software applications and platforms and embedded operating systems as of december 31 2014  we employed 3797 people in our worldwide rd organization 

  

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications integrating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings in our products we are leveraging our software asic and systems technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers applications and continuing to develop technology to support the buildout of high performance networks and cloud environments we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

our rd process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our rd team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market expenditures for rd were 10062 million  10432 million  and 11016 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

sales and marketing 

  

as of december 31 2014  we employed 2348 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

  

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals system engineers and marketing and channel teams is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers within each team sales team members serve the following three geographic regions i americas including united states canada mexico caribbean and central and south america ii emea and iii apac within each region there are regional and country teams as well as vertical market focused teams to ensure we operate close to our customers 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below 

  

in the united states and canada we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers almost all of our sales outside the united states and canada are made through our channel partners 

  

direct sales structure 

  

our sales team engages with enduser customers with whom we have direct relationships the terms and conditions of these arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgment of those orders or by purchase contracts the direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

channel sales structure 

  

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales we utilize various channel partners including but not limited to the following 

  9 

 

 

customer service 

in addition to our products we offer support professional and educational services we deliver these services directly to our channel partners and to endusers and utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and thirdparty organizations as appropriate 

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of support professional and educational services to ensure these services are locally delivered 

as of december 31 2014  we employed 1493  people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we employ support engineers consultants and educators with proven network experience to provide those services 

manufacturing and operations   

as of december 31 2014  we employed 332  people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and subtier suppliers and monitor and manage product testing and quality 

our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers in the united states us china malaysia mexico and taiwan as of december 31 2014  we utilize celestica incorporated flextronics international ltd accton technology corporation and alpha networks inc for the majority of our manufacturing activity our contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required for our products to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

 

 

 

our contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to agreedupon specifications products are then shipped to our distributors vars or endusers generally we do not own the components title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the contract manufacturers location customers take title to the products upon delivery at a specified destination if the components 

 10 

remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and outside design manufacturer as applicable may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis 

we also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical component supplies the majority of our inventory is production components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand 

some of our custom components such as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs 

  

by working collaboratively with our suppliers we have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted a supplier code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers one element of our supplier code of conduct is adoption and compliance with the electronic industry code of conduct “eicc” the eicc outlines standards to promote ethical business practices eliminate human trafficking and ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe workers are treated with respect and dignity and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible our corporate citizenship report and supplier code of conduct are available on our website 

backlog 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  our total product backlog was approximately 4453 million  and 4707 million  respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers generally within the next six months and excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sellthrough to endusers backlog also excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts 

seasonality   

  

we as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns historically we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

competition 

  

we compete in the network infrastructure markets these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer agility advantages in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc cisco has historically been the dominant player however our principal competitors also include alcatellucent arista networks inc arista brocade communications systems inc brocade hewlett packard company hp and huawei technologies co ltd huawei 

  

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco alcatellucent hp and huawei among others bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition marketing budgets and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

  

in addition there are a number of other competitors in the security space including check point software technologies ltd check point f5 networks inc f5 networks fortinet inc fortinet and palo alto networks inc palo alto networks among others who tend to be focused on single product line solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line 

 11 

in addition to established competitors a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

  

we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco alcatellucent and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products further there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue 

  

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

  

environment   

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulations adopted by the european union and china to date compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however see the risk factor entitled regulation of industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a of part i of this report for additional information concerning rohs compliance 

we are also voluntarily participating in the cdp formerly the carbon disclosure project and encourage our direct material suppliers representing an aggregate of at least 80 of our consolidated total direct expenditure to do the same cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors in fact in 2014 we achieved a position on cdp’s sp 500 climate disclosure leadership index the sp 500 climate performance leadership index and the cdp supplier climate performance leadership index 2014 we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis we believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world 

  

in addition we are committed to the environment through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency of key elements in our highperformance network product offerings in 2012 we launched a set of carrierclass mpls switches the ptx5000 series in addition to filling the capacity and density requirement for internet core growth ptx5000 which featured record energy efficiency of 15w per gigabit of throughput in 2014 we further enhanced the ptx5000 series and introduced the fpc2 for the ptx5000 mpls switches which features energy efficiency of 12w per gigabit of throughput and we also launched the mpc6 for our mx2020 and mx2010 3d universal edge routers which uses 2w per gigabit of fullduplex traffic the environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business 

  

intellectual property   

  

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

  

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products and from time to time we license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 12 

as of december 31 2014  we had over 2400 patents worldwide and numerous patent applications are pending patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

employees   

  

as of december 31 2014  we had 8806 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

investments in our securities involve significant risks even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered in the past significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors disclosed by us including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our business operating results and stock price 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

the factors that may cause our quarterly results to vary quarter by quarter and be unpredictable include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in the mix of products and services sold changes in the mix of geographies in which our products and services are sold changing market and economic conditions current and potential customer consolidation competition customer concentration long sales and implementation cycles unpredictable ordering patterns changes in the amount and frequency of share repurchases or dividends regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example we and many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending particularly in the first quarter furthermore market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations such adjustments may be difficult or impossible to execute in the short or medium term 

as a result of these factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some quarters our operating results will be below our guidance our longterm financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance 

a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and there is an ongoing trend toward consolidation in the industry in which our customers and partners operate any decrease in revenues from our customers or partners could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners particularly in our service provider market changes in the business requirements vendor selection project prioritization financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior including product mix purchased of our key customers could significantly decrease our sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in recent years there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example vodafone’s acquisition of spanish cable operator ono numericable’s purchase of sfr france’s secondlargest telecommunications operator the acquisition of tw telecom by level 3 communications att’s proposed acquisition of directtv and comcast’s proposed acquisition of time warner cable and that consolidation trend has continued if our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay suspend or indefinitely reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or other direct or indirect unforeseen consequences could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate 

 15 

forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses in addition economic uncertainty as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world have and may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions which has led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products to delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects andor higher costs of production for example if the us dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies such as the euro our revenues reported in us dollars would decline in addition for us dollar denominated sales an increase in the value of the us dollar would increase the real cost to customers of our products in markets outside the us which could impact our competitive position more generallyspeaking economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore instability in the global credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the short and medium term therefore fluctuations in revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margins from quarter to quarter 

uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions 

in periods of market expansion we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in rd sales and marketing and other parts of our business conversely in 2014 to refocus the company’s strategy optimize its structure and improve operational efficiencies in connection with our integrated operating plan or iop we implemented a new strategic focus realigned our organization into a onejuniper structure reduced our workforce consolidated and closed facilities made changes to enhance efficiency improved cost management measures and instituted new capital allocation plan in connection with cost management we implemented a substantial cost reduction plan accomplished through various restructuring activities across research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the underperformance of our security reporting unit and product rationalizations further strategyrelated pivots could lead to delays in achieving revenue and profit forecasts and result in additional impairment some of our expenses are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees rapid changes in the size alignment or organization of our workforce including sales account coverage could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

a customers decision to purchase certain of our products particularly new products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers 

 16 

with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times both of which may be exacerbated by the impact of continued global economic weakness may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competition is intense in the markets that we serve the network equipment market has historically been dominated by cisco with competition coming from other companies such as alcatellucent brocade hewlett packard company and huawei in the security market we face intense competition from these same companies as well as companies such as check point f5 networks fortinet and palo alto networks further a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all for example in recent years oracle acquired acme packet inc and cisco acquired meraki networks inc and sourcefire inc which further consolidated our market a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our partners and resellers generally sell or resell competing products on a nonexclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete which could also adversely affect our business 

we expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time and the level of product gross margins achieved by us in recent years may not be sustainable 

we expect our product gross margins to vary from quartertoquarter and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including customer product and geographic mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete increases in material labor or inventory carrying costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if we do not accurately forecast product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures for example in the third quarter of 2012 our margins declined as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

further in early 2014 we announced our iop which in combination with our new cost reduction initiative announced in october 2014 is intended to reduce our operating expenses and to focus on cost controls we expect that our margins will accordingly vary with our ability to achieve the goals of the iop as supplemented by the new cost reduction initiative as well as our ability to maintain or increase our revenues we can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve all of the goals of these plans or meet our announced expectations in whole or in part or that our plans will have the intended effect of improving our margins on the expected timeline or at all 

to the extent we receive product orders late in a quarter we may be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our quarterly revenues 

generally our network equipment products are not stocked by distributors or resellers due to their cost and complexity and the custom nature of configurations required by our customers we generally build such products as orders are received in recent years the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter has generally stabilized but remains unpredictable if orders for certain products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter additionally we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

 17 

conversion of key internal systems and processes particularly our erp system and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with and therefore harm our business and operations 

we have underway a multiphase project to convert certain key internal systems and processes including our customer relationship management “crm” system and enterprise resource planning erp system since 2012 we have been implementing major changes to our erp system which activities we expect to continue into 2015 in the third quarter of 2014 we implemented the manufacturing fulfillment and inventory portion of this erp project and we are now reliant upon dual erp systems until completion of the conversion the next major change to our erp program is projected for the third quarter of 2015 when we plan to eliminate the dual erp system a delay past this time could result in postponement of this systems change until the first quarter of 2016 we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes any problems disruptions delays or other issues in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes particularly any that impact our operations could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide service and support to our customers bill and track our customers collect cash from our customers maintain our dso measure fulfill contractual obligations record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner recognize revenue file sec reports in a timely manner or otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects as noted above the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated and in the event of lengthy project delays we may experience issues with retention of the implementation team if we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more lengthy or costly than anticipated our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

we rely on single or limited sources of certain of our components during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited any future spike in growth in our business or more likely in it spending and the economy in general is likely to create greater shortterm pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed for example from time to time we have experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of product shipments we currently purchase numerous key components including asics from single or limited sources the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules also longterm supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may further increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

we rely on valueadded and other resellers as well as distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded and other reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm and nsn the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products and some of which sell their own competing products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues for example in 2011 and 2012 one of our oem partners dell acquired force10 and sonicwall both competitors of ours as a result dell became increasingly competitive in certain areas their resale of our products declined and we ultimately terminated our oem relationship with dell our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets fail to expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing 

 18 

valueadded resellers and distributors effectively determine that we cannot continue to do business with these partners for any reason or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and scale and improve our processes and procedures that support the channel as a result our programs processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage we have previously entered into oem agreements with partners pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the programs processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy increasingly companies including us are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to penetration or attacks by computer programmers and hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen which could subject us to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and cause us reputational and financial harm in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks 

if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed because the techniques used by computer programmers and hackers many of whom are highly sophisticated and wellfunded to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions in addition the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the programmer or hacker which are often difficult to pinpoint 

regulation of industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects 

we are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas for example some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria even though those criteria may be in conflict with accepted international standards other regulations that may negatively impact our business include country of origin regulations these types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries “drc” and procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals” these minerals are present in our products sec rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply drc “conflict free” components and parts and we may not be able to obtain drc conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals” used in our products 

 19 

in addition environmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment may adversely impact our business and financial condition these laws and regulations include the european union eu restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products currently our products comply with the eu rohs requirements however it is possible that certain exemptions may be revoked in the future including an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment upon which we and our competitors rely and which is currently scheduled to expire in july 2016 revocation of this exemption or further changes to this or other laws or passage of new similar laws in other jurisdictions may require us to cease selling noncompliant products in the eu or reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us disrupt our operations or logistics and result in an adverse impact on our operating results additionally eu and china have adopted the weee directive which requires producers of electrical and electronic equipment to assume responsibility for collecting treating recycling and disposing of products when they have reached the end of their useful life as well as reach regulations which regulate handling of certain chemical substances that may be used in our products 

the traditional telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the internet telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks but future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the internet and internet service provider access charges we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service providers or cloud provider companies regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers needs for products designed to enable a wide range of such services or business models for instance the us federal communications commission is considering new regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks through proposals regarding net neutrality and government regulation of the internet these regulations and regulations resulting from these proposals might impact service provider and cloud provider business models and as such providers needs for internet telecommunications equipment and services also many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security supply chain integrity privacy and data protection any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment 

the adoption and implementation of such regulations could reduce demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products result in product inventory writeoffs impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner and require us to spend significant time and expense to comply and we could face fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues 

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of among other things encryption technology certain of our products contain or use encryption technology in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring certification notifications review of source code or the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys for example russia and china recently have implemented new requirements relating to products containing encryption and india has imposed special warranty and other obligations associated with technology deemed critical governmental regulation of encryption or ip networking technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or export sanctions including recent restrictions on exports to russia could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in harm to our reputation penalties costs and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or governmentfunded projects 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers or other partners as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology it systems the systems and processes of third parties and the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the 

 20 

systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed for example although it did not adversely affect our shipments an earthquake in late december of 2006 disrupted our communications with china where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs in addition as discussed earlier in this risk factors section beginning in 2012 and continuing into 2015 we have been implementing major changes to our enterprise resource planning system any failure of the new system or interruptions during the transition may impair communications with our manufacturers and therefore adversely affect our ability to build and ship our products 

we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturers were not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us which prevented us from meeting our commitments to our customers if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

telecommunications and cloud service provider companies and our other large customers generally require onerous terms and conditions in our contracts with them as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

telecommunications and cloud service provider companies which comprise a significant portion of our customer base and other large companies generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and accordingly often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers for example our customers france telecomorange and deutsche telekom ag have formed a company for the purpose of purchasing products from and negotiating more favorable contractual terms with suppliers as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

in addition service providers have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future technological shifts market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such technological shifts needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all for example the move from traditional network infrastructures towards softwaredefined networking or sdn has been receiving considerable attention in our view it will take several years to see the full impact of sdn and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine hardware and software elements if we fail to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to meet those requirements in a timely manner it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance 

in addition in the past two years we have announced new products including the qf5100 t4000 core router ex9200 ethernet switch mx series routers ptx 3000 packet transport router and juniper networks contrail if these or other new products do not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets and aspirations may be adversely affected in addition if we fail to deliver new or announced products to the market in a timely manner it could adversely affect the market acceptance of those products and harm our competitive position and our business and financial results 

 21 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

we are a party to lawsuits investigations proceedings and other disputes which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay fines or damages undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors have been or are subject to various lawsuits we have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters commercial transactions and patent infringement as well as securities laws as noted in note 16 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this report under the heading of “legal proceedings” the us securities and exchange commission sec and the us department of justice doj are conducting investigations into possible violations by the company of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa in a number of countries the investigations relate to whether the company or any third party on behalf of the company gave money or anything else of value to any government official in violation of the fcpa the company’s audit committee with the assistance of independent advisors has been investigating and conducting a thorough review of possible violations of the fcpa and has made recommendations for remedial measures including employee disciplinary actions in foreign jurisdictions which the company has implemented and continues to implement litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain we therefore cannot predict the duration scope outcome or consequences of litigation and government investigations in connection with any government investigations including those in which we are currently involved as described above if the government takes action against us or we agree to settle the matter we may be required to pay substantial fines and incur other sanctions which may be material and suffer reputational harm the lawsuits and investigations are expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights resolution of which may be time  consuming and expensive as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies enter into license agreements or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

we are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill annually and on an interim basis if an event occurs or there is a change in circumstance that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets below their carrying values as of december 31 2014  our goodwill was 29815 million  and there were no intangible assets with indefinite lives when the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill a charge to operations is recorded if the carrying amount of an intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value a charge to operations is recognized either event would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred 

 22 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we rationalized our security product portfolio including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products including our junos® pulse product these factors decreased our shortterm and nearterm revenue and profitability forecasts for our security reporting unit during our fiscal year 2014 annual goodwill impairment test the carrying value of our security reporting units goodwill exceeded its fair value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million 

in recent years economic weakness has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours declines in our level of revenues due to restructuring or cost reductions or declines in our operating margins as well as sustained declines in our stock price increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives may become impaired in future periods 

our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis such as expected future cash flows the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets and our stock price if the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets however any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by the following earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the research and development “rd” tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement costs related to intercompany restructuring tax effects of sharebased compensation or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association of 34 countries including the us is contemplating changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these contemplated changes if finalized and adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins for example in the third quarter of 2012 our gross margins were reduced as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time and because our contract manufacturers are thirdparty manufacturers for numerous other companies if we underestimate our requirements as we did in the third quarter of 2010 with respect to certain components our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products which could increase costs or delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships which includes failing to provide accurate forecasts of our requirements or if one or more of them experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be 

 23 

delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our ability to compete 

we generally rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology any of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings and other competitive harm furthermore the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and vars in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the united states in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic business regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the united states or in other countries in which we operate in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors channel partners and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in termination of our relationship 

 24 

financial reporting problems fines andor penalties for us or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro indian rupee and japanese yen related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars and a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities however such attempts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations are costly and no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances including longterm declines in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business for example in 2014 we acquired wandl inc and in 2012 we acquired contrail systems inc contrail and mykonos software inc mykonos acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs and liabilities diversion of managements attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired business if we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders use a substantial portion of our cash resources assume liabilities record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

the divestiture of our junos pulse product portfolio could disrupt our business and may not yield the intended benefits 

we recently completed the sale of our junos pulse product portfolio to an affiliate of siris capital a private equity firm for total consideration of 2307 million  of which 1057 million  was in cash net of a 193 million  working capital adjustment and 1250 million  was in the form of an 18month noncontingent interest bearing promissory note issued to the company since approximately 1250 million  of the transaction consideration is in the form of an 18month noncontingent seller promissory note there is also the risk that we may not receive the amount owed to us by the buyer under the note and that instead the junos pulse assets will return to us 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our 

 25 

reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to effectively implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected defects errors or malware or do not meet customer quality expectations our business could be adversely affected and we may be subject to additional costs or lawsuits or be required to pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers any errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in monetary penalties loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and reputation penalties and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition in the event an error defect malware or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty or indemnification defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed moreover if our products fail to satisfy our customers quality expectations for whatever reason the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or are not available on terms acceptable to us our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the failure to comply with the terms of any license including free open source software may result in our inability to continue to use such license our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us if possible to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the buildout of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when our customers are determining the design of those 

 26 

networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception our stock price and cause us to incur additional expense 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions may be adversely affected if our financial statements are not reliable and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major credit rating agencies routinely evaluate our indebtedness this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

we may be unable to generate the cash flow to service our debt obligations including the senior notes and the revolving credit facility 

in february 2014 we issued 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 450 senior unsecured notes due 2024 the “2024 notes” and in march 2011 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes the “senior notes” and together with the 2024 notes the “notes” and see discussion in note 10 longterm debt and financing in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report as of december 31 2014  we had 13490 million  in outstanding longterm debt in june 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility with an option to increase the credit facility up to a maximum of 7000 million the credit agreement will terminate in june 2019 at which point all amounts borrowed must be repaid as of december 31 2014  no amounts were outstanding under the credit agreement 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to service our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon or to make anticipated capital expenditures our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance which will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control based upon current levels of operations we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness including the notes and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon however if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt we may be required to sell assets reduce capital expenditures refinance all or a portion of our existing debt including the notes or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the indentures that govern the notes contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

 27 

the credit agreement contains two financial covenants along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following 

 

 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business a failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default in addition in the event of an acceleration we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments including those under the senior notes any notes issued in connection with the recentlyannounced capital return program discussed above and the revolving credit facility if drawn upon 

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

in october 2014 we announced a cash dividend of 010 per share of common stock payable on december 23 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on december 2 2014 our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors any failure to pay or increase future dividends as announced reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

in addition our board of directors recently authorized a 11 billion increase to our current capital return plan which includes a planned 15 billion of share repurchases before the end of the second quarter of 2015 the capital return plan will be funded by a combination of onshore cash previously issued debt and potentially additional debt financing to preserve our financial flexibility to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain our investment grade credit rating any failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our shareholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at december 31 2014  we had 16396 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 14653 million  in short and longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in assetbacked securities certificates of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities government sponsored enterprise obligations money market funds mutual funds publiclytraded equity securities time deposits and us government securities certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market sovereign debt and interest rate risks our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

business and market environment 

at juniper networks we design develop and sell products and services for highperformance networks to enable customers to build highly scalable reliable secure and costeffective networks for their businesses while achieving agility efficiency and value through automation we focus on customers and partners across our key verticals who view these network attributes as fundamental to their business including global service providers enterprises financial services cloud hosting providers governments research and public sector organizations product and solution differentiation with a relentless customer focus will allow us to achieve our primary goal of growing revenue faster than the market 

we sell our products in more than 100 countries in three geographic regions americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific apac we sell our highperformance routing switching and security network products and service offerings to service provider and enterprise markets our silicon systems and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking helping customers achieve superior performance greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership in addition to our products we offer technical support and professional services as well as education and training programs to our customers together our highperformance product and service offerings help our customers convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation value and increased performance reliability and security to endusers 

during 2014 we saw a slight decline in net revenues yearoveryear primarily due to reduced spending by us carriers however the diversity in our business across verticals such as cloud and cable providers helped to partially offset the decline we expect the overall revenue environment to be challenging over the next several quarters as market dynamics including consolidation are impacting demand from our largest us service provider customers we believe our product gross margins may continue to vary in the future due to competitive pricing pressures which may be offset by additional operational efficiencies nevertheless we are focused on executing our strategy that is focused on designing developing and selling products and services for highperformance networks we believe our product portfolio continues to be strong and we remain focused on operational excellence cost discipline and targeted growth initiatives 

in 2014 we continued to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio which resulted in new product offerings across routing switching and security in routing we announced a virtualized version of our flagship mx series 3d universal edge routing platform the vmx 3d universal edge router to deliver the industrys first fullfeatured carriergrade virtualized router giving service providers and enterprises the ability to seamlessly leverage the benefits of both virtual and physical networking in switching to address the networking requirements of large cloud providers and enterprise customers who build large and massive scale data centers we announced ocx1100 the first switch to combine open compute project ocp hardware design with a carrierclass network operating system junos os we also announced a new line of ex4600 ethernet switches to fulfill the increasing demands for highly available access to cloud services and applications across enterprise campus networks 

additionally we expanded our sdn portfolio with new software and hardware including the northstar controller a new trafficengineering controller leveraging open industrystandard protocols built to optimize service providers’ transport networks as well as the junos fusion software that controls thousands of independent network elements from a single management plane 

 34 

key strategic technology partnerships also delivered new solutions to address the highperformance network requirements of our service provider and enterprise customers through integration with gainspeed’s technology and our mx series 3d universal edge routers and ex series switches we announced the virtual converged cable access platform allowing cable operators to better automate and scale their edgeaccess infrastructure while creating a platform for new cloudbased services additionally we partnered with nokia to advance the telco cloud for mobile broadband and accelerate service creation by bringing together nokias leading liquid core solution and the juniper networks metafabric™ data center architecture including contrail furthermore we signed a go to market agreement with aruba to deliver an open converged enterprise network solution by integrating aruba mobility solutions with juniper enterprise switches and routers delivering ongoing product innovation to enterprise customers 

for security we announced firefly perimeter a virtual version of our srx series service gateway new advancements in our spotlight secure threat intelligence platform junos space virtual director an application that automates the management and deployment of firefly perimeter as well as juniper argon secure an advanced antimalware service 

due to the recent underperformance of our security products and efforts to refocus our security offerings we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 we intend to focus on stabilizing revenues in our security reporting unit in 2015 and as a result we are pivoting our security strategy to focus on building integrated solutions that focus on network resiliency and business continuity across cloud data center branch campus and service provider mobile infrastructure by taking advantage of the existing and ongoing innovation of our junosbased srx platform 

in 2014 we implemented a series of initiatives designed to streamline our organization improve operational efficiencies rationalize our product portfolios and return capital to our shareholders these actions were largely completed by the end of 2014 

in the first quarter of 2014 we realigned our organization into a onejuniper structure which included consolidating each of our research and development rd and gotomarket functions to reduce complexity increase clarity of responsibilities and improve efficiency 

to improve operational efficiency in 2014 we implemented various restructuring activities and structural cost saving actions across research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses we completed the 2014 restructuring plan through workforce reductions facility consolidations or closures asset writedowns contract terminations and other actions as a result we recorded a total restructuring charge of 2077 million  in cost of sales and restructuring and other charges in connection with the rationalization of our product portfolio we completed the sale of junos pulse for total consideration of 2307 million  which resulted in a gain of 196 million  in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these cost management actions we achieved our total annualized operating expense savings commitment of 2600 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 

in addition to these cost reduction activities we introduced a capital allocation program to return capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2014 we returned 23 billion of capital to our stockholders through the completion of a 12 billion accelerated share repurchase program asr and the repurchase of 11 billion of our common stock subsequent to the asr we also paid two quarterly cash dividends of 010  per share for an aggregate amount of 860 million  and issued 3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 450  senior notes due 2024 2024 notes which allowed us to partially fund the asr we intend to return 10 billion of aggregate share repurchases by the end of the second quarter of 2015 subject to raising additional debt financing

financial results and key performance metrics overview   

the following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions except per share amounts percentages days sales outstanding dso and booktobill 



 

 

 

during 2013 compared to 2012 we experienced net revenue growth in the americas in both service provider and enterprise offset by a decline in revenue in apac and emea the yearoveryear increase in our net revenues during 2013 was primarily due to increases in edge routing switching and service revenue partially offset by a decline in our security products revenue 

  

 

during 2013 compared to 2012 our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges recorded in 2012 partially offset by higher inventory provisions in 2013 for legacy platforms 

  36 

unit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 restructuring and other charges of 2077 million  related to severance facility consolidations and closures assetwriteoffs and contract terminations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan as well as a component remediation charge of 207 million relating to the memory product quality defect    

our operating income as a percentage of revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to growth in net revenues also contributing to the increase in operating income were lower restructuring and other charges of 522 million compared to 2012 

 

 

 

operating cash flows increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the timing of payments to our vendors higher deferred revenue and lower taxes paid partially offset by the timing of payments for incentive compensation to our employees and the timing of receipts from our customers 

 

dso increased by 6 days or 17 for the quarter ended december 31 2013 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2012 the increase was primarily due to large multiyear service renewals at the end of the period which increased our outstanding receivables compared to the same period in 2012 

 

 

as of december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 total deferred revenue increased by 1459 million  primarily due to an increase in deferred service revenue driven by the execution of several multiyear support agreements and to a lesser extent an increase in annual agreement renewals slightly offset by a decrease in deferred product revenue 

critical accounting policies and estimates   

  

the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our significant accounting policies see note 2 

 37 

significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

 

goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination or an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recorded the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of november 1 st  or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment level by comparing the reporting units carrying value including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating results of the component 

the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units 

our goodwill impairment test involves a twostep process to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the first step tests for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units with the reporting unit’s net asset values if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting units does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the second step requires an assignment of the reporting unit’s fair value to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities using the relevant acquisition accounting guidance to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill and if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

in the first step the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using both the income and market valuation approaches we believe the income approach and the market approach are equally representative of the reporting unit’s fair value under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publiclytraded companies in similar lines of business in the application of the income and market valuation approaches we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 

 38 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units and then apply a control premium which is determined by considering control premiums offered as part of the acquisitions that have occurred in market segments that are comparable with our reporting units the income approach and the market approach are equally weighted to derive the fair value of the reporting unit 

prior to the second step the longlived assets such as property plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if needed an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 

in the second step the reporting units fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets such as existing technology backlog and customer relationships in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates customer renewal rates and technology obsolescence rates used in valuing intangible assets and pricing of comparable transactions in the market in valuing the tangible assets 

during our fiscal year 2014 annual goodwill impairment test our reporting units were routing switching and security 

the fair value of the routing and switching reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value however the fair value of the security reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value and therefore we determined the security reporting unit’s goodwill was impaired in 2014 we realigned our gotomarket and research and development resources on projects with the highest potential for growth and continued to leverage our engineering efforts across our routing switching and security products in the fourth quarter of 2014 we began to implement a new security strategy focused on network resiliency and performance based on the srx platform as a result we rationalized our security product portfolio including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products including the divestiture of junos pulse these factors decreased our shortterm and nearterm revenue and profitability forecasts of the security reporting unit 

as a result the carrying value of the security reporting units goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million  which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 

refer to item 8 of part ii note 7 goodwill and purchased intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 our contract manufacturer liabilities were 253 million  and 229 million respectively 

significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory and obsolete material exposures we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence 

 39 

because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and contract manufacturer liabilities which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 

 

under our revenue recognition policies we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price “esp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles when determining esp we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years 

 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules in addition oecd’s contemplated changes to numerous longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

results of operations 

the following table presents product and service net revenues in millions except percentages 



2014 compared to 2013 

routing product net revenues decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of weaker demand for core routing partially offset by strong growth of our ptx series products edge routing net revenues increased as a result of strong demand for our mx series products partly offset by older edge routing platforms the yearover year decline was driven by weakness from large us carriers partially offset by strength from cloud providers 

switching product net revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting growth from both our qfabric system and our ex series products during the year we saw strong adoption of qfabric data center switches by a growing number of customers with especially strong demand from cloud providers in the americas 

security product net revenues decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a continuing decline in our legacy screen os products and the divestiture of our junos pulse product lines sales of our srx platform declined slightly yearoveryear due to lower demand from us carrier customers 

the increase in service revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewals service revenues are largely correlated with product revenues therefore if product net revenues decline it can have an impact on future service revenues 

 41 

2013 compared to 2012 

routing product net revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to an increase in volume of sales of our edge routing products to both service provider and enterprise customers reflecting customer demand for the mx platform in particular 

switching product net revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of an increase in ex and qfabric product lines for both service provider and enterprise markets also contributing to the increase in net revenues were new product introductions for the enterprise campus and data center infrastructure 

security product net revenues decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a decline in legacy screen os and our srx platform 

the increase in service revenue in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily driven by strong contract renewals from our installed base across routing switching and security products 

net revenues by geographic region 

the following table presents net revenues by geographic region in millions except percentages 



2014 compared to 2013 

the increase in net revenues in the americas in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in net revenues from service provider markets partially offset by a decline in the enterprise market the increase in net revenues in the service provider market was due to strong demand from cloud and cable providers partially offset by a decrease in demand from carriers the decline in the enterprise market resulted from a decline in net revenues due to recognition of revenue from a large us federal government contract in 2013 

net revenues in emea slightly increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to stronger demand from service providers partially offset by a decrease in net revenues from the enterprise market although demand from the public sector remained strong 

net revenues in apac decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a decline in net revenues from both the service provider and enterprise market 

2013 compared to 2012 

net revenues in the americas increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in revenues from both the service provider and enterprise markets the increase in service provider revenues was due to an increase in sales to cloud providers and cable providers partially offset by a slight decrease in sales to carriers the increase in enterprise revenues in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to a broadbased improvement in customer demand as well as the recognition of a large us federal government contract 

 42 

net revenues in emea decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a decline in revenues in the enterprise market attributable to certain large sales in 2012 

net revenues in apac decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower revenues in enterprise resulting from weaker conditions in the china enterprise market service provider revenues were relatively flat as a decline in sales with certain large service providers in japan were offset by higher revenue with certain large carriers in china additionally the recognition of revenue from a large service provider in singapore was offset by declines in revenues from other service providers in apac 

net revenues by market and customer 

the following table presents net revenues by market in millions except percentages 



we sell our highperformance routing switching and security network products and service offerings to two primary markets service provider and enterprise determination of which market a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customers industrial classification code but may also include subjective factors such as the intended use of the product the service provider market generally includes wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers including those that provide social networking and search engine services the enterprise market generally is comprised of businesses federal state and local governments research and education institutions and financial services 

2014 compared to 2013 

net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in 2014 compared to 2013 with growth in the americas and emea the increase in service provider net revenues in the americas was driven by increased revenues from cloud and cable providers partially offset by decreased revenues from large carriers the increase in service provider net revenues in emea was attributable to growth with large carriers while in apac net revenues in the service provider market declined as a result of lower demand with both small and large carriers in addition service provider demand for switching products continued to be strong 

net revenues from sales to the enterprise market decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a decline in sales in all geographic regions however revenue demand from public sector customers was higher for all three regions 

2013 compared to 2012 

net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in sales to cloud providers and cable providers in the americas partially offset by a slight decrease in sales to wireless carriers while the service provider market in emea and apac was relatively flat in addition service provider demand for switching and data center solutions in 2013 was stronger than in 2012 

net revenues from the enterprise market increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to broadbased growth in the americas enterprise market as well as recognition of a large us federal government contract partially offset by weaker demand in apac and emea 

customer 

no customer accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during the year ended december 31 2014  and 2013 during the year ended december 31 2012  verizon accounted for 103  of our net revenues 

 43 

gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



2014 compared to 2013 

product gross margin decreased as a percentage of product net revenues in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in cost of revenues the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to asset writedowns of 415 million for product rationalizations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan and 207 million in connection with an industrywide memory product quality defect in a component from a thirdparty supplier excluding the costs of the restructuring and component defect product gross margin as a percentage of net revenues improved slightly primarily due to the favorability in product mix in the 2014 period 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in labor and logistics delivery costs to support new contracts and product introductions 

2013 compared to 2012 

product gross margin percentage increased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges recorded in 2012 partially offset by higher inventory provisions in 2013 for legacy platforms product gross margin benefited from cost reductions in the supply chain in 2013 which more than offset the impact of higher pricing discounts 

service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher service revenues and greater efficiency in the delivery of services 

 44 

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expenses in millions except percentages 



our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnelrelated costs including wages commissions bonuses benefits sharebased compensation and travel particularly with respect to research and development and sales and marketing activities facility and information technology “it” departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount facility and it related headcount was 366 396 and 368 as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we had a total of 8806 9483 and 9234 employees as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

2014 compared to 2013 

research and development 

research and development expense decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower personnelrelated expenses as a result of restructuring actions and divestiture of our junos pulse product lines research and development headcount decreased 8 from 4135 as of december 31 2013 to 3797 as of december 31 2014 the decrease in research and development personnel expense was partially offset by higher sharebased compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of wandl inc in the first quarter and engineering program costs in 2014 compared to 2013 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower personnelrelated expenses and other discretionary expenses due to our cost reduction efforts and creating efficiency in our sales activities the decrease in personnelrelated expenses is primarily due to headcount reductions sales and marketing headcount decreased 11 from 2626 as of december 31 2013 to 2348 as of december 31 2014 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher litigation and investigation related costs incurred in the current period in connection with investigation into possible violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and to a lesser extent our patent litigation case with palo alto networks inc pan as well as other litigation matters this increase was partially offset by personnelrelated expenses as a result of headcount reductions of 8 from 513 as of december 31 2013 to 470 as of december 31 2014 our patent litigation with pan was settled in 2014 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher charges recorded in 2014 in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan during 2014 we implemented the 2014 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of 1662 million related to workforce reductions contract terminations project cancellations and facility closures the 2014 

 45 

restructuring plan has been substantially completed as of december 31 2014 and we do not expect to record significant future charges see note 9 restructuring and other charges in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our restructuring activities 

impairment of goodwill 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we began to implement a new security strategy focused on network resiliency and performance based on the srx platform as a result we rationalized our security product portfolio including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products including the divestiture of junos pulse these factors decreased our short term and near term revenue and profitability forecasts of the security reporting unit during our fiscal year 2014 annual goodwill impairment test the carrying value of our security reporting units goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 8500 million  which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in part ii item 8 of this report see note 7 goodwill and purchased intangibles in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on the impairment of goodwill 

2013 compared to 2012 

research and development 

research and development expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower depreciation expense of 283 million attributable to the extended useful lives of computers and equipment in 2013 as well as lower prototype development costs of 186 million in addition outside services facilities and it costs decreased related to the cancellation of certain projects and facility closures the decrease in research and development expense was partially offset by increases in personnelrelated expenses primarily attributable to higher sharebased compensation expense and to a lesser extent higher variable compensation research and development headcount increased 1 from 4081 as of december 31 2012 to 4135 as of december 31 2013 additionally we continued to shift headcount to lower cost regions 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher personnelrelated expenses related to an increase in commission expense driven by improved sales achievement partially offset by lower sharebased compensation expense and lower outside service and travel due to our cost reduction efforts and creating efficiency in our sales activities sales and marketing headcount decreased 2 from 2680 as of december 31 2012 to 2626 as of december 31 2013 as a result of our restructuring activities 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher litigation costs the increase in general and administrative expense was partially offset by lower personnelrelated expenses primarily sharebased compensation expense general and administrative headcount increased 6 from 486 as of december 31 2012 to 513 as of december 31 2013 to support our financerelated initiatives including our erp implementation 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher charges recorded in 2012 in connection with our 2012 restructuring plan during 2013 we implemented the 2013 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of 391 million related to workforce reductions contract terminations project cancellations and facility closures in connection with our plans see note 9 restructuring and other charges    in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our restructuring activities 

 46 

sharebased compensation 

  

sharebased compensation expense associated with equity incentive awards awards which include stock options restricted stock units rsus restricted stock awards rsas and performance share awards psas as well as our employee stock purchase plan espp was recorded in the following cost and expense categories in millions except percentages 

2014 compared to 2013 

sharebased compensation expense remained consistent in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in expense related to rsus rsas and psas assumed in connection with our acquisition of wandl in 2014 and the increase in grant date fair values due to higher stock prices was offset by a decrease in actual shares vested 

2013 compared to 2012 

sharebased compensation expense remained consistent in 2013 compared to 2012 offsetting increases in expense related to rsas assumed in connection with our acquisition of contrail at the end of 2012 were decreases in actual shares vested and a decline in grant date fair values due to our lower stock prices 

other income expense net and income tax provision 

the following table presents other income expense net and income tax provision in millions except percentages 



other income expense net 

interest income primarily includes interest income from our cash cash equivalents and investments interest expense primarily includes interest net of capitalized interest expense from our longterm debt and customer financing arrangements other typically consists of foreign exchange gains and losses and other nonoperational income and expense items   

 47 

2014 compared to 2013 

interest income 

interest income increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a higher balance of longer term investments yielding higher interest 

interest expense 

interest expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the issuance of our 2024 notes in the first quarter of 2014 see note 10 longterm debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2024 notes 

gain on legal settlement 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we entered into a settlement agreement with pan resolving patent litigation between the two companies which resulted in a realized gain on legal settlement and subsequent sale of related securities of 1961 million  net of legal fees 

gain on investments 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we recorded a gain of 1630 million  primarily related to the sale of investments which were converted from privatelyheld investments to publiclytraded equity upon ipo and subsequently sold during the year ended december 31 2013  net gain on investments was primarily comprised of a gain of 71 million  related to the companys privatelyheld investments and publicly tradedequity investments 

gain on sale of junos pulse 

the sale of our junos pulse product portfolio was completed on october 1 2014 and we recorded a gain of 196 million  in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations this sale was driven by product rationalization in connection with our initiative to focus on projects with the highest potential for growth see note 8 other financial information in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on the sale junos pulse 

2013 compared to 2012 

interest income 

interest income decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower cash balances and interest rates as well as a shift to certain investments yielding lower interest 

interest expense 

interest expense increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher capitalized interest in 2012 resulting from our phased sunnyvale campus buildout 

gain on investments 

gain on investments decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher net gains recorded in 2012 related to our privatelyheld investments which included a 147 million  gain from the acquisition of our privatelyheld investment in contrail 

income tax provision 

the effective rate for 2014 differs from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of the nondeductible goodwill charge and tax gain on sale of junos pulse offset by the benefit from release of the company’s valuation allowance attributable to investment losses the federal rd credit recognition of domestic production activities deductions and earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates the passage of tax increase prevention act of 2014 on december 19 2014 retroactively reinstated the us federal rd tax credit from january 1 2014 to december 31 2014  

 48 

the effective rate for 2013 was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the benefit of the federal rd credit a tax settlement with the irs recognition of domestic production activities deductions and earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates 

the effective tax rate for 2012 was substantially similar to the federal statutory rate of 35 the effective rate for 2012 does not reflect the benefit of the federal rd credit which expired on december 31 2011 

our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items as a result of the expiration of the federal research and development credit on december 31 2014 we expect our effective tax rate to increase in 2015 see item1a of part i risk factors of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results 

for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and further explanation of our income tax provision see note 14 income taxes  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities the issuance of our common stock and the issuance of our longterm debt the following table shows our capital resources in millions except percentages 



the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable reduced by accounts payable accrued liabilities and shortterm deferred revenue working capital decreased by 8183 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of our stock repurchase activities tax payments dividends and purchase of capital equipment as well as a decline in short term investments 

summary of cash flows 

as of december 31 2014  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 6444 million  from december 31 2013  primarily due to purchases and retirement of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program capital expenditures federal estimated tax payment dividend payout and higher payments related to all restructuring plans partially offset by the issuance of the 2024 notes in february 2014 cash received from the sale of certain equity investments cash received from the patent litigation settlement and proceeds from the sale of junos pulse 

the following table summarizes cash flows from our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions except percentages 



 49 

operating activities 

2014 compared to 2013 

cash flow from operations decreased by 825 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower cash collections from customers higher payments related to our restructuring plans higher taxes paid and lower prepayments compared to prior year 

2013 compared to 2012 

cash flows from operations increased by 2082 million  in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher net income the timing of payments to our vendors higher deferred revenue and lower taxes paid partially offset by the timing of payments for incentive compensation to our employees and the timing of collections on our outstanding receivables 

investing activities 

2014 compared to 2013 

net cash provided by investing was 4340 million in 2014 compared to net cash used in investing of 5610 million in 2013 the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to higher proceeds from sale of investments and fewer purchases of investments as well as proceeds received from the sale of junos pulse 

2013 compared to 2012 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 346 million  in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower spending on acquisitions and asset purchases as well as lower capital expenditures as we completed our phased sunnyvale campus buildout partially offset by higher purchases of investments 

financing activities 

2014 compared to 2013 

net cash used in financing activities increased by 14225 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to purchases and retirement of our common stock and payment of cash dividends partially offset by the issuance of the 2024 notes 

2013 compared to 2012 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 1466 million  in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower purchases and retirement of our common stock partially offset by an increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises as well as proceeds from customer financing arrangements 

stock repurchase activities 

in february 2014 the board approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to 21 billion  of our common stock 2014 stock repurchase program in october 2014 the board authorized a 13 billion  increase to the 2014 stock repurchase program for a total of 34 billion as of december 31 2014 there was 12 billion  of authorized funds remaining under the 2014 stock repurchase program we intend to repurchase 10 billion of our common stock by the end of the second quarter of 2015 as part of our three year capital return program subject to raising additional debt financing future share repurchases will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements our stock repurchase programs may be discontinued at any time 

 50 

the following table summarizes our stock repurchase activities in millions except per share amounts 



 

 

dividends 

on july 22 2014 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 010  per share of our common stock or 438 million  in the aggregate to stockholders of record on september 2 2014 which was paid on september 23 2014 on october 23 2014 we declared a cash dividend of 010  per share of common stock or 422 million on december 23 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on december 2 2014 any future dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates are subject to approval by our board or an authorized committee thereof see note 18 subsequent events  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on our dividend declaration subsequent to december 31 2014  

  

restructuring 

as of december 31 2014  our restructuring liability was 170 million  of which 94 million  is related to severance which are expected to be paid in full by the first quarter of 2015 74 million  related to facility closures expected to be paid through march 2018 and 02 million  related to contract and other charges see note 9 restructuring and other charge s in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on our restructuring plans 

deferred revenue 

deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to shipments to distributors that have not sold through to endusers undelivered product commitments and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue deferred service revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services which include technical support hardware and software maintenance professional services and training 

the following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues in millions 



 51 

as of december 31 2014  net deferred product revenue decreased 194 million  to 2256 million  compared to 2450 million  as of december 31 2013  as a result of lower distributor inventory and multiple revenue releases in relation to previously deferred product revenue as of december 31 2014  the increase in deferred service revenue of 258 million  attributed to the execution of several multiyear support agreements and an increase in annual agreement renewals 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however in the normal course of business we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance guarantees related to thirdparty customerfinancing arrangements customs and duties guarantees and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities see guarantees below and note 16 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our guarantees 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments debt and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 



1 see note 16 commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our contractual commitments 

2  see note 10  longterm debt and financing in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our debt 

as of december 31 2014  we had 1775 million  included in longterm income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes as a result this amount is not included in the table above 

revolving credit facility 

on june 27 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year 5000 million  unsecured revolving credit facility with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional 2000 million  subject to certain conditions proceeds from borrowing made under the credit agreement may be used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until june 27 2019 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid we will pay to each lender a facility fee on a quarterly basis based on the amount of each lenders commitment to make loans of between 0100 and 0250 depending on our public debt rating revolving loans may be prepaid without penalty subject to customary breakage costs for loans bearing interest at the eurocurrency rate we are also obligated to pay customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type 

the credit agreement includes customary events of default that include among other things nonpayment of principal interest or fees inaccuracy of representations and warranties violation of covenants cross default to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events involving the company or its material subsidiaries material judgments change of control and certain erisa events the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the credit agreement 

 52 

a default interest rate shall apply at the request of the required lenders on all obligations during a payment event of default under the credit agreement at a rate per annum equal to 2000 above the applicable interest rate 

the credit agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 30 x and an interest coverage ratio no less than 30 x during the term of the credit facility in addition the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to among other things grant liens merge or consolidate dispose of all or substantially all of its assets change their accounting or reporting policies change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type as of december 31 2014  the company was in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement and no amounts were outstanding see note 10 longterm debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

guarantees 

we have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a thirdparty we also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance guarantees related to thirdparty customerfinancing arrangements custom and duty guarantees and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities under certain thirdparty customer financing arrangements that contain guarantee provisions which have terms of up to four years we are liable for the aggregate unpaid payments to the thirdparty financing company in the event of customer default as of december 31 2014  we have not made any payments under these arrangements as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  we had 262 million  and 401 million  respectively in financing guarantees bank guarantees and standby letters of credit related to these financial guarantees of which 222 million  in financing guarantees was recorded in other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014  

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future additionally in 2014 we indicated that we intend to return 41 billion to our stockholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends from february 2014 through the end of 2016 to the extent we repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or pay cash dividends on our common stock our liquidity may be impacted 

in august 2013 we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec enabling us to offer for sale from time to time an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions our 2024 notes were issued under the automatic shelf registration statement which was issued pursuant to a prospectus filed with the sec on february 28 2014 any other offerings of securities under the automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus in addition the revolving credit facility under our credit agreement will also provide additional flexibility for future liquidity needs 

we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of our common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant our intention for 2014 was to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at 250 or less of our common stock outstanding on a pure share basis where each option rsu rsa or psa granted is counted as one share based upon shares underlying options rsus rsas and psas granted during 2014 we were at or below this target 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations planned stock repurchases and dividends and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including but not limited to

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk   

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility in addition as of december 31 2014  85 of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the us which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated our marketable securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income these investments are also reviewed to identify and evaluate indications of potential otherthantemporary impairments as discussed in note 4 cash equivalents and investments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

  

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  related to the sales of certain investments 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our availableforsale fixed income securities held as of december 31 2014  and 2013  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 





  

these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

  

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts   

  

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of one year or less 

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen approximately 78 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

 55 

respectively in other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was a reduction to operating expenses of 21 in 2014  and an increase of 08 and 15 in 2013  and 2012  respectively 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december 31 2014  and as of december 31 2013  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of nonus dollar cash cash equivalents and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10 movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in us dollars as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  by less than 12 

equity price risk   

our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities and our nonqualified deferred compensation “nqdc” plan which may also hold publiclytraded equity securities are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates 

we do not purchase our publiclytraded equity securities classified as availableforsale securities on our consolidated balance sheets for speculative purposes as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities had an estimated fair value of 20 million  and 1146 million  respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our publiclytraded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair value of 07 million and 345 million as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively 

investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  the total investments under our nqdc plan were 163 million  and 154 million  respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change on the total investments under the nqdc plan would result in a loss in the fair value of 49 million and 46 million as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively 

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies depending on the nature of these investments some can be carried at cost and others can be carried at fair value in 2014  2013  and 2012  we recorded impairment charges of 11 million  28 million  and 200 million  respectively on our investments in privatelyheld companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in note 5 fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report the aggregate cost of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 899 million  and 572 million  as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively

strategy 

in february 2014 we announced an integrated operating plan iop to refocus the company on innovation that matters most to service providers and enterprises where demand for highiq networks and bestinclass cloud environments are driving growth the iop strategy capitalizes upon our engineering expertise across routing switching security control and network management to align our focus to become a leading provider of secure highiq networks while serving the needs of cloud builders through the execution of the iop we plan to coalesce our engineering talent gotomarket teams and rd around this strategy resulting in streamlined operations and business portfolio and operational efficiencies as we implement the iop it is possible that our segments may change 

we believe many of the core tenets of our historical strategic efforts described below carry forward and form the foundation of our successful implementation of the iop 

maintain and extend technology leadership 

we are recognized around the world as an innovation leader in networking our junos os applicationspecific integrated circuit “asic” technology and networkoptimized product architecture were key elements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership 

leverage position as supplier of highperformance network infrastructure 

from inception we have focused on designing developing and building highperformance network infrastructure for the worlds most demanding networking environments we consistently deliver groundbreaking leading technologies that transform the economics and experience of networking—significantly improving customer economics by lowering the capital expenditures required to build networks and the operating expenses required to manage and maintain them we believe that many customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors and that the scale performance reliability and security of our products will provide us with a competitive advantage which is critical to be selected as one of those vendors 

  

be a strategic partner to our customers 

in developing our solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build bestinclass products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers which has enabled us to design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date we plan to continue to work handinhand with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as to design products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace while enabling customers to reduce costs we are committed to investing in rd at a level that drives our innovation agenda enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers 

enable new internet protocol ipbased services   

our platforms have enabled network operators to quickly build and secure networks costeffectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products by enabling new ipbased services we have significantly broadened our service provider business over the last several years while also significantly expanding our presence in the enterprise market 

establish and develop industry partnerships 

our customers have diverse requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders with diverse technologies and services that extend the value of the network to our customers these partnerships ensure that our customers have access to those technologies and services whether through technology integration joint development resale or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers requirements in addition we believe an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs

markets and customers   

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturer “oem” partners to endusers in the service provider and enterprise markets we believe the network needs for service providers such as carriers—wireless and wireline cable and content and web 20 service companies are converging as are those of large enterprise and national governments as these customers focus on highiq networks and cloud environments 

service providers   

service providers generally include wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers including those that provide social networking and search engine services we support most major service provider networks in the world and our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance reliability and security that service providers demand we believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our service provider customers by 

 

 

 

 

while many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline wireless or cable operators in recent years we have seen increased convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships we believe these strategic developments are made technically possible as operators invest in the buildout of highiq networks and cloud environments 

we believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions these trends include significant growth in ip traffic on service provider networks because of peertopeer interaction broadband usage video an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our service provider customers and of their enterprise customers the advent of data center clouds that concentrate business applications in large ip network connected facilities and growth in mobile traffic as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including notebooks netbooks smartphones and tablets 

the infrastructure market for service providers includes products and technology at the network core the network edge to enable access the aggregation layer the data center where many services are created security to protect from the inside out and the outside in the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs and the management service awareness and control of the entire infrastructure 

enterprise   

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the worlds most demanding businesses the enterprise market generally is comprised of businesses federal state and local governments financial services and research and education institutions enterprises and public sector organizations such as governments and research and education institutions that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications in addition our solutions

as with the service provider market innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market highperformance enterprises require highiq networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance reliability and security with bestinclass open solutions for maximum flexibility we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers branch and campus applications distributed and extended enterprises and consumer and business devices 

customers 

in 2013 and 2011 no  single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues in 2012 verizon communications inc verizon accounted for 103  of our net revenues 

products and technology   

  

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created 

in the last seven years we have expanded our portfolio to address domains in the network the core the edge access and aggregation data centers wans and campus and branch we have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon systems and software to provide a range of solutions in highperformance networking that can solve unique problems for customers 

our focus on highperformance networking leads to a focus on three product areas routing switching and security in each of the past three fiscal years routing switching security and services each accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues the following is an overview of our major product families within each of our segments in 2013

platform strategy   

  

in addition to our major product families our software portfolio was a key technology element in our strategy to be the leader in highperformance networking 

our junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers the junos platform includes the following products 

   

 

 

   

junos os is designed to maintain continuous systems and improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades this operational efficiency allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenuegenerating applications helping to advance the economics of highperformance networking 

the security and stability of junos os combined with its modular architecture and common source code base provides a foundation for delivering performance reliability security and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments with an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage junos os including routing switching and security products we believe junos os provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors 

 

our contrail network orchestration system offers an opensource standardsbased platform for softwaredefined networks sdn and network function virtualization this platform enables our customers to address their key problems in the area of network automation agility and timetoservice deployment by providing a mechanism to virtualize the network over any physical network and automating the provisioning and management of networking services such as security and load balancing contrail’s differentiation includes a distributed architecture that allows us to build in highavailability and inservice upgrade capabilities a multivendor solution familiar to our customers that allows contrail to seamlessly interoperate with equipment from major networking vendors an opensource licensing model and an orchestration systemagnostic approach that provides rest apis that can be used by customers to work with their own provisioning and management systems 

significant product development projects   

in 2013 we continued to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio which resulted in new product offerings during 2013 including a series of new products for the enterprise campus and data center infrastructures including the ex9200 ethernet switch a programmable core switch to support emerging applications and growing workloads additionally we enhanced our mx series portfolio with the release of the mx104 mx2010 and the mx2020 service provider edge routers designed for rapid service delivery and application enablement we also released the worlds smallest supercore the ptx3000 to address the scale and flexibility challenges facing service providers as they converge their networks to optimize their business furthermore to help enterprise organizations and service providers address the challenges associated with managing multiple geographically dispersed data centers we unveiled metafabric a new architecture for next generation data centers metafabric simplifies and accelerates the deployment and delivery of applications within and across multiple data center locations 

 8 

we also announced the availability of juniper networks contrail a standardsbased and highly scalable network virtualization and intelligence solution for sdn and introduced opencontrail a new initiative that makes the source code library for contrail available through an open source license which we believe will help to foster innovation in sdn we also announced enhancements to the sdnready mx series 3d universal edge router portfolio that significantly expands system capacity subscriber bandwidth and service performance 

customer service 

  

in addition to our products we offer support professional and educational services we deliver these services directly to our channel partners and to endusers and utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and thirdparty organizations as appropriate 

  

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of support professional and educational services to ensure these services are locally delivered 

  

as of december 31 2013  we employed 1452  people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we employ support engineers consultants and educators with proven network experience to provide those services 

  

manufacturing and operations   

  

as of december 31 2013  we employed 361  people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor and manage product testing and quality 

  

as of december 31 2013  we have subcontracted with celestica incorporated and flextronics international ltd for the majority of our manufacturing activity in 2013 we completed the disengagement of plexus corporation plexus as a contract manufacturer as part of our initiative to reduce our contract manufacturers from three to two 

our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers in the united states us china malaysia mexico and taiwan our contract manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required for our products to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

 

 

 

our contract manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to agreed upon specifications products are then shipped to our distributors vars or endusers generally we do not own the components and title to the products transferred from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis 

we also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical component supplies the majority of our inventory is production components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand 

 9 

our applicationspecific integrated circuits asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources such as international business machines corporation “ibm” each of which is responsible for all aspects of asics production using our proprietary designs 

  

by working collaboratively with our suppliers we have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted a supplier code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers one element of our supplier code of conduct is adoption and compliance with the electronic industry code of conduct “eicc” the eicc outlines standards to promote ethical business practices eliminate human trafficking and ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe workers are treated with respect and dignity and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible 

research and development 

  

we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols software applications and platforms and embedded operating systems as of december 31 2013  we employed 4135 people in our worldwide rd organization 

  

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications integrating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings in our products we are leveraging our software asic and systems technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers applications and continuing to develop technology to support the buildout of highiq networks and cloud environments we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

our rd process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our rd team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market expenditures for rd were  10432 million  11016 million  and 10268 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

  

sales and marketing 

  

as of december 31 2013  we employed 2626 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

  

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals system engineers and marketing and channel teams is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers within each team sales team members serve the following three geographic regions i americas including united states canada mexico caribbean and central and south america ii emea and iii apac within each region there are regional and country teams as well as major account teams to ensure we operate close to our customers 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below 

  

in the united states and canada we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers almost all of our sales outside the united states and canada are made through our channel partners 

  

direct sales structure 

  

our sales team engages with enduser customers with which we have direct relationships the terms and conditions of these arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgment of those orders or by purchase contracts the direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

 10 

channel sales structure 

  

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales we utilize various channel partners including but not limited to 

 

 

   

backlog 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  our total product backlog was approximately 4707 million  and 4105 million  respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers generally within the next six months and excludes both orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sellthrough to endusers backlog also excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts 

seasonality   

  

we as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first quarter historically we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

competition 

  

psd business 

  

in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc cisco has historically been the dominant player in the market however our principal competitors also include alcatellucent brocade communications systems inc brocade extreme networks inc extreme networks hewlett packard company hp and huawei technologies co ltd huawei 

  

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco alcatellucent hp and huawei among others bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios many of our current and potential competitors have greater 

 11 

name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

  

ssd business 

  

in the market for ssd products cisco generally is our primary competitor with its broad range of products in addition there are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines within ssd including check point software technologies ltd check point f5 networks inc f5 networks fortinet inc fortinet and palo alto networks inc palo alto networks among others these additional competitors tend to be focused on single product line solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

  

for both product groups we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco alcatellucent and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products there continues to be consolidation in this industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue 

  

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

  

environment   

  

we are subject to regulations that have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulations adopted by the european union and china in addition we participate in the carbon disclosure project “cdp” cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors it hosts one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data in the world at wwwcdprojectnet we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis we believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world 

  

to date compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

in addition we are committed to the environment by our effort in improving the energy efficiency of key elements in our highperformance network product offerings in 2012 we launched a set of carrierclass mpls switches the ptx5000 series in addition to filling the capacity and density requirement for internet core growth ptx5000 also features record energy efficiency of 15w per gigabit of throughput the environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business 

  

intellectual property   

  

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise 

  

while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

  

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 12 

our success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

as of december 31 2013  we had over 2000 patents worldwide patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary 

  

employees   

  

as of december 31 2013  we had 9483 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

investments in our securities involve significant risks even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered in the past significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors disclosed by us including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our business operating results and stock price 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

the factors that may cause our quarterly results to vary quarter by quarter and be unpredictable include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in the mix of products and services sold changes in the mix of geographies in which our products and services are sold changing market and economic conditions current and potential customer consolidation competition customer concentration long sales and implementation cycles unpredictable ordering patterns changes in the amount and frequency of share repurchases or dividends regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example we and many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending particularly in the first quarter furthermore market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations such adjustments may be difficult or impossible to execute in the short or medium term 

as a result of these factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below our guidance our longterm financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses in addition economic uncertainty concerns over the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the european union as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world have and may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions which has led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products to delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects andor higher costs of production economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore instability in the global credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the short and medium term therefore fluctuations in revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margins from quarter to quarter 

uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 15 

a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and there is an ongoing trend toward consolidation in the industry in which our customers and partners operate any decrease in revenues from our customers or partners could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners for example verizon accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during 2012 changes in the business requirements vendor selection financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior including product mix purchased of our key customers could significantly decrease our sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in recent years there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example the acquisitions of global crossing by level 3 communications and qwest communications by centurylink and softbanks purchase of a controlling interest in sprint nextel and that consolidation trend has continued if our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay suspend or indefinitely reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or other unforeseen consequences could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

a customers decision to purchase certain of our products particularly new products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times both of which may be exacerbated by the impact of continued global economic weakness may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competition is intense in the markets that we address the psd market has historically been dominated by cisco with competition coming from other companies such as alcatellucent brocade extreme networks hewlett packard company and huawei in the ssd market we face intense competition from the above companies as well as companies such as check point cisco f5 networks fortinet and palo alto networks further a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all for example in 2013 oracle acquired acme packet inc and cisco acquired meraki networks inc and sourcefire inc which further consolidated our market a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and the level of product gross margins achieved by us in recent years may not be sustainable 

we expect our product gross margins to vary from quartertoquarter and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including customer product and geographic mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete increases in material or labor costs increases in inventory carrying costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if we do not accurately 

 16 

forecast product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures for example in the third quarter of 2012 our margins declined as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

further we recently announced an iop to reduce our operating expenses and to focus on cost controls we expect that our margins will accordingly vary with our ability to achieve the goals of the iop we can provide no assurance that we will meet our announced expectations in whole or in part or that our plans will have the intended effects of improving our margins 

to the extent we receive product orders late in a quarter we may be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our quarterly revenues 

generally our psd products are not stocked by distributors or resellers due to their cost and complexity and the custom nature of configurations required by our customers we generally build such products as orders are received in recent years the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter has generally continued to increase but remains unpredictable if orders for certain products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter additionally we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

we rely on single or limited sources of certain of our components during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited any future growth in our business it spending and the economy in general is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed for example from time to time we have experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of product shipments we currently purchase numerous key components including asics from single or limited sources the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules also longterm supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may further increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

we rely on valueadded and other resellers as well as distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded and other reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm and nsn the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products and some of which sell their own competing products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues for example in 2011 and 2012 one of our oem partners dell acquired force10 and sonicwall both competitors of ours as a result dell became increasingly competitive in certain areas their resale of our products declined and we ultimately terminated our oem relationship 

 17 

with dell our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets fail to expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and scale and improve our processes and procedures that support the channel as a result our programs processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage we have previously entered into oem agreements with partners pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the programs processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers or other partners as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology it systems the systems and processes of third parties and the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed for example although it did not adversely affect our shipments an earthquake in late december of 2006 disrupted our communications with china where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs in addition as discussed later in this risk factors section beginning in 2012 and we expect continuing into 2015 we have been implementing major changes to our enterprise resource planning erp system any failure of the new system or interruptions during the transition may impair communications with our manufacturers and therefore adversely affect our ability to build and ship our products 

we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturers were not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us which prevented us from meeting our commitments to our customers if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

telecommunications and content service provider companies and our other large customers generally require onerous terms and conditions in our contracts with them as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

telecommunications and content service provider companies which comprise a significant portion of our customer base and other large companies because of their size generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and accordingly often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions applicable to us recently our customers france telecomorange and deutsche telekom ag have formed a company for the purpose of purchasing products from and negotiating more favorable contractual terms with suppliers as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

in addition service providers have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties 

 18 

for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy increasingly companies including juniper networks are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis despite our security measures juniper networks information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to penetration or attacks by computer programmers and hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen which could subject us to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and cause us reputational and financial harm in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks 

if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed because the techniques used by computer programmers and hackers many of whom are highly sophisticated and wellfunded to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions in addition the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the programmer or hacker which are often difficult to identify 

regulation of industry and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects 

we are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas for example some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria even though those criteria may be in conflict with accepted international standards other regulations that may negatively impact our business include country of origin regulations these types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries “drc” and procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals” these minerals are present in our products sec rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply drc “conflict free” components and parts and we may not be able to obtain drc conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals” used in our products 

in addition environmental regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations may impact our business and financial condition adversely for instance the european union and china have adopted weee and rohs regulations which require producers of electrical and electronic equipment to assume responsibility for collecting treating recycling and disposing of products when they have reached the end of their useful life as well as reach regulations which regulate handling of certain chemical substances that may be used in our products 

the traditional telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the internet telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks but future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the internet and internet service provider access charges we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service or content providers regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or content providers could adversely affect those customers needs for products designed to enable a wide range of such services or business models for instance the us federal communications commission has issued regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks these 

 19 

regulations might impact service provider and content provider business models and as such providers needs for internet telecommunications equipment and services also many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security supply chain integrity privacy and data protection any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment 

the adoption and implementation of such regulations could reduce demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products result in product inventory writeoffs impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner and require us to spend significant time and expense to comply and we could face fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues 

certain of our products contain or use encryption technology the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export among other things encryption technology in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring certification notifications review of source code or the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys for example russia and china recently have implemented new requirements relating to products containing encryption and india has imposed special warranty and other obligations associated with technology deemed critical governmental regulation of encryption or ip networking technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in harm to our reputation penalties costs and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or governmentfunded projects 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future technological shifts market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such technological shifts needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all for example the move from traditional network infrastructures towards sdn has been receiving considerable attention in our view it will take several years to see the full impact of sdn and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine hardware and software elements together if we fail to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to meet those needs in a timely manner it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance 

in addition in the past two years we announced new products including the qfx3000m qfabric system t4000 core router ex9200 ethernet switch mx series routers ptx 3000 packet transport router and juniper networks contrail if these or other new products do not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected in addition if we fail to achieve market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets and aspirations may be adversely affected finally if we fail to deliver new or announced products to the market in a timely manner it could adversely affect the market acceptance of those products and harm our competitive position and our business and financial results 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term in january 2014 shaygan kheradpir became the new ceo of the company succeeding kevin johnson who had served as our ceo since september 2008 the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

 20 

we are a party to lawsuits investigations proceedings and other disputes which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay fines or damages undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits we have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters commercial transactions and patent infringement as well as securities laws a description of the securities lawsuits can be found in note 16 commitments and contingencies    in notes to consolidated financial statements of this report under the heading “legal proceedings” in addition as noted under the heading of “legal proceedings” the us securities and exchange commission and the us department of justice are conducting investigations into possible violations by the company of the us foreign corrupt practices act litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain we therefore cannot predict the duration scope outcome or consequences of these matters there can be no assurance that these or any actions or investigations that have been or may in the future be brought against us our officers and our directors will be resolved favorably in connection with any government investigations in the event the government takes action against us or the parties enter into an agreement to settle the matter we may be required to pay substantial fines andor incur other sanctions the lawsuits and investigations are likely to be expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights resolution of which may be time  consuming and expensive as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies or enter into license agreements or to cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

we are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill annually and on an interim basis if an event occurs or there is a change in circumstance that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets below their carrying values as of december 31 2013  our goodwill was 40577 million  and there were no intangible assets with indefinite lives when the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill a charge to operations is recorded if the carrying amount of an intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value a charge to operations is recognized either event would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred 

in the past we experienced a reduction of 12800 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately nine months prior to the impairment review and to a lesser extent to a decrease in forecasted future cash flows 

in recent years economic weakness has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours declines in our level of revenues or operating margins as well as sustained declines in our stock price increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives may become impaired in future periods 

during the three months ended september 30 2013 we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis on our ssd segment based on our analysis we determined that our ssd segment’s goodwill is not impaired however our analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis such as expected 

 21 

future cash flows the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets and our stock price if the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets however any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement costs related to intercompany restructuring tax effects of sharebased compensation or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers and the manufacturers order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins for example in the third quarter of 2012 our gross margins were reduced as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time and because our contract manufacturers are thirdparty manufacturers for numerous other companies if we underestimate our requirements as we did in the third quarter of 2010 with respect to certain components our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products which could increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships which includes failing to provide accurate forecasts of our requirements or if one or more of them experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in other countries in addition in 2013 we reduced the number of our contract manufacturers and transitioned the work of one manufacturer to two of our other existing manufacturers if we do not manage the recent transition effectively we could experience delays or quality issues each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

upgrades to key internal systems and processes and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with and therefore harm our business and operations 

we previously initiated a multiyear project to upgrade certain key internal systems and processes including our companywide human resources management system our customer relationship management “crm” system and enterprise resource planning erp system in the first quarter of 2010 we implemented a major upgrade of our crm system since 2012 we have been implementing major changes to our erp system which activities we expect to continue into 2015 we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes any 

 22 

disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide service and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner file sec reports in a timely manner or otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more costly than anticipated our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights 

we generally rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology any of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings and other competitive harm furthermore the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions 

in periods of market expansion we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in rd sales and marketing and other parts of our business 

conversely in the third quarter of 2012 to align our cost structure with longterm strategic plans as part of our productivity and efficiency initiatives we restructured our business rebalanced our workforce and reduced our real estate portfolio similarly in connection with our recently announced iop we expect to initiate a substantial cost reduction plan accomplished through various restructuring activities across research and development sales and marking and general and administrative expenses many of our expenses such as real estate expenses are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees moreover rapid changes in the size of our workforce could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and vars in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the united states in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 

 23 

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including the following 

 

 

 

 

any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the united states or in other countries in which we operate in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors channel partners and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in termination of our relationship financial reporting problems fines andor penalties for us or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro indian rupee and japanese yen related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars and a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities however such attempts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations are costly and no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances including longterm declines in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business for example in 2014 we acquired wandl inc and in 2012 we acquired contrail systems inc contrail and mykonos acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs and liabilities diversion of managements attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired business if we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined 

 24 

organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders use a substantial portion of our cash resources assume liabilities record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors or malware or do not meet customer quality expectations our business could be adversely affected and we may be subject to lawsuits or be required to pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers any errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in monetary penalties loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and reputation penalties and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition in the event an error defect malware or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty or indemnification defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed moreover if our products fail to satisfy our customers quality expectations for whatever reason the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or are not available on terms acceptable to us our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the failure to comply with the terms of any license including free open source software may result in our inability to continue to use such license our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new 

 25 

products and product enhancements could require us if possible to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the buildout of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when the customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception our stock price and cause us to incur additional expense 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions may be adversely affected if our financial statements are not reliable and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse affect on our stock price 

in february 2014 we announced our intention to implement payment of a quarterly dividend commencing in the third quarter of 2014 our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors any failure to pay or increase future dividends as announced reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could have a material adverse affect on our stock price 

in addition as part of our iop the board of directors authorized 20 billion in share repurchases to be executed through the end of the first quarter of 2015 including 12 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program to be entered into during the first quarter of 2014 the capital return plan will be funded by a combination of onshore cash and newly issued debt to preserve our financial flexibility to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain our investment grade credit rating we can provide no assurances that we will be able to consummate the debt offering on terms acceptable to us or at all any failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our shareholders could have an material adverse effect on our stock price 

we may be unable to generate the cash flow to service our debt obligations including the senior notes 

in march 2011 we issued senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principle amount of 10 billion see discussion in note 10 longterm debt and financing in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report as of december 31 2013 we had 9993 million  in outstanding longterm debt we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to service our 

 26 

indebtedness including the notes or to make anticipated capital expenditures our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance which will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control based upon current levels of operations we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness including the senior notes however if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt we may be required to sell assets reduce capital expenditures refinance all or a portion of our existing debt including the senior notes or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the indenture that governs the senior notes also contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business a failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default in addition in the event of an acceleration we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments including those under the senior notes and any notes issued in connection with the recentlyannounced capital return program discussed below 

in addition in february 2014 we announced a capital return program to be effected over three years we expect to incur additional indebtedness to fund actions expected to be taken pursuant to that program 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at december 31 2013  we had 22840 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 18138 million  in short and longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in assetbacked securities certificate of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities government sponsored enterprise obligations money market funds mutual funds publiclytraded equity securities and us government securities certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market sovereign debt and interest rate risks our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   

  

the following discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item 8 of this report 

  

the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” in the course of operating our business we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices the collection of receivables the manufacturing and shipment of products the fulfillment of orders the purchase of supplies and the building of inventory and spare parts among other matters each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period in making these decisions we consider various factors including contractual obligations customer satisfaction competition internal and external financial targets and expectations and financial planning objectives for further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates see “critical accounting policies and estimates” section included in this “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item 7 our “risk factors” section included in item 1a of part i and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 of part ii of this report 

business and market environment 

at juniper networks we design develop and sell products and services for highperformance networks which combine scale and performance with agility and efficiency so customers can build the best networks for their businesses our routing switching and security products address the highperformance networking requirements of global service providers enterprises governments and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success our silicon systems and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking helping customers achieve superior performance greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership 

we do business in three geographic regions americas emea and apac during 2013 we operated under two business segments platform systems division psd and software solutions division ssd our psd segment primarily offers scalable routing and switching products that are used in service provider enterprise and public sector networks to control and direct network traffic between data centers core edge aggregation campus wide area networks wans and consumer and business devices our ssd segment offers solutions focused on network security and network services applications for both service providers and enterprise customers both segments offer worldwide services including technical support and professional services as well as educational and training programs to our customers during 2013 we realigned certain products from our psd segment to our ssd segment in connection with our acquisition of contrail systems inc contrail in addition we consolidated operational oversight and management of all security products within the ssd segment as a result of this product realignment security products previously reported in the psd segment including the branch srx branch firewall and j series product families are now reported in the ssd segment we reclassified the segment data for the prior years to conform to the current year presentation we believe these changes provide investors with increased financial reporting transparency and enable better insight into the market and performance trends driving our business 

during 2013 we saw revenue growth in both our service provider and enterprise markets as well as a shift in product mix towards edge routing switching and data center solutions we continue to remain focused on turning around the security business as customers build highiq networks and cloud environments further we believe that we are experiencing an improving but still uncertain global macroeconomic environment in which our customers exercise care and conservatism in their investment prioritization and project deployments we expect that our customers will remain thoughtful with their capital spending we believe our product gross margins may decline in the future due to competitive pricing pressures which may be offset by additional operational improvements and cost efficiencies nevertheless we are focused on executing our strategy to address the market trends of mobile internet and cloud computing and we continue to believe there are positive longterm fundamentals for highperformance networking including highiq networking as well as cloud environments for data centers 

 33 

we continued to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio which resulted in new product offerings during 2013 including a series of new products for the enterprise campus and data center infrastructures including the ex9200 ethernet switch a programmable core switch to support emerging applications and growing workloads additionally we enhanced our mx series portfolio with the release of the mx104 the mx2010 and the mx2020 service provider edge routers designed for rapid service delivery and application enablement we also released the worlds smallest supercore the ptx3000 to address the scale and flexibility challenges facing service providers as they converge their networks to optimize their business furthermore to help enterprise organizations and service providers address the challenges associated with managing multiple geographically dispersed data centers we unveiled metafabric a new architecture for next generation data centers metafabric simplifies and accelerates the deployment and delivery of applications within and across multiple data center locations 

we also announced the availability of juniper networks contrail a standardsbased and highly scalable network virtualization and intelligence solution for sdn and introduced opencontrail a new initiative that makes the source code library for contrail available through an open source license which we believe will help to foster innovation in sdn we also announced enhancements to the sdnready mx series 3d universal edge router portfolio that significantly expands system capacity subscriber bandwidth and service performance 

during 2013 we initiated a restructuring plan the 2013 restructuring plan to continue to improve our cost structure and rationalize our product portfolio and rebalance our investments the 2013 restructuring plan consists of workforce reductions contract terminations and project cancellations of which 283 million  were recorded in 2013 we were not able to achieve the full benefit of our cost savings goal of 1000 million in 2013 see note 9 restructuring and other charges    in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our restructuring activities 

in february 2014 we announced an integrated operating plan iop to refocus the company on innovation that matters most to service providers and enterprises where demand for highiq networks and bestinclass cloud environments are driving growth the iop strategy capitalizes upon our engineering expertise across routing switching security control and network management to align our focus to become a leading provider of secure highiq networks while serving the needs of cloud builders through the execution of the iop we plan to coalesce our engineering talent gotomarket teams and rd around this strategy resulting in streamlined operations and business portfolio and operational efficiencies as we implement the iop it is possible that our segments may change

critical accounting policies and estimates   

  

the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our significant accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

 

we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of november 1 st  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment level by comparing the reporting units carrying value including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using significant judgment based on a combination of the income and the market approaches under the income approach we estimate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of forecasted future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting units to values of publiclytraded companies in similar lines of business if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill when the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows operating trends riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and 

 36 

inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units as of december 31 2013  goodwill recorded for our psd segment and ssd segment was 16166 million  and 24411 million  respectively the fair value of our reporting units in particular ssd are sensitive to events or changes in circumstances such as adverse changes in operating results or macroeconomic conditions changes in managements business strategy or declines in our stock price a hypothetical 5 decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would result in the fair value of our ssd segment to be equal to its carrying value see item 1a of part i risk factors for more information 

 

we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 our contract manufacturer liabilities were 229 million  and 277 million respectively 

significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory and obsolete material exposures we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and contract manufacturer liabilities which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 

 

under our revenue recognition policies we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price “esp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles when determining esp we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years we applied esp to the majority of our product revenue and vsoe to our service revenue in 2013 2012 and 2011 

  37 

circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

results of operations 

the following table presents product and service net revenues in millions except percentages 



 38 

2013 compared to 2012 

the increase in product revenues in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of sales of our edge routing products and switching products to both service provider and enterprise customers reflecting customer demand for highperformance networking such as highiq networks and cloud environments for data centers also contributing to the increase in product revenues was new product introductions for the enterprise campus and data center infrastructures partially offset by a decrease in sales of our security products 

the increase in service revenue in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily driven by strong contract renewals from our installed base across our routing switching and security products 

2012 compared to 2011 

the decrease in product revenues in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to a decline in sales of our core and edge routing and firewall products partially offset by an increase in our switching and highend srx products 

the increase in service revenues in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily driven by strong contract renewals for certain edge routing switching and security products 

net revenues by market and customer 

the following table presents net revenues by market in millions except percentages 



market 

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings from both our psd and ssd segments to two primary markets service provider and enterprise determination of which market a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customers industrial classification code but may also include subjective factors such as the intended use of the product the service provider market generally includes wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers including those that provide social networking and search engine services the enterprise market generally is comprised of businesses federal state and local governments financial services and research and education institutions 

2013 compared to 2012 

net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in sales to content providers and cable providers in the americas partially offset by a slight decrease in sales with wireless carriers while the service provider market in emea and apac was relatively flat in addition service provider demand for switching and data center solutions in 2013 was stronger than in 2012 

net revenues from the enterprise market increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to broadbased growth in the americas enterprise market as well as recognition of a large us federal government contract partially offset by weaker demand in apac and emea 

 39 

2012 compared to 2011 

net revenues from sales to the service provider market decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to reduced routing purchases by some of our international and content service providers partially offset by strong growth from large service providers in the americas 

net revenues generated from the enterprise market decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower revenue in federal and financial services offset by our expanding presence in apac and emea 

customer 

no customer accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during the year ended december 31 2013  and 2011 during the year ended december 31 2012  verizon accounted for 103  of our net revenues 

net revenues by geographic region 

the following table presents net revenues by geographic region in millions except percentages 



2013 compared to 2012 

net revenues in the americas increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in revenues from both the service provider and enterprise markets the increase in service provider revenues was due to an increase in sales to content providers and cable providers partially offset by a slight decrease in sales to carriers the increase in enterprise revenues in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to a broadbased improvement in customer demand as well as the recognition of a large us federal government contract 

net revenues in emea decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a decline in revenues in the enterprise market attributable to certain large sales in 2012 

net revenues in apac decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower revenues in enterprise resulting from weaker conditions in the china enterprise market service provider revenues were relatively flat as a decline in sales with certain large service providers in japan were offset by higher revenue with certain large carriers in china additionally the recognition of revenue from a large service provider in singapore was offset by declines in revenues from certain service providers in apac 

2012 compared to 2011 

net revenues in the americas increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increased sales in the united states to certain service providers offset by a decline in the enterprise market particularly among federal and financial services customers 

net revenues in emea decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to decreased sales in western and southern europe which we believe was a result of the challenging economic climate in those areas the decrease was partially offset by increased revenues in the middle east and from a top service provider in eastern europe across a broad range of our product portfolio 

 40 

net revenues in apac decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in sales to a certain service provider customer in japan following a large product deployment that occurred in 2011 

gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



2013 compared to 2012 

product gross margin percentage increased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges recorded in 2012 partially offset by higher inventory provisions in 2013 for legacy platforms product gross margin benefited from cost reductions in the supply chain in 2013 which more than offset the impact of higher pricing discounts 

service gross margin increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher service revenues and greater efficiency in the delivery of services 

2012 compared to 2011 

product gross margin percentage decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a 443 million inventory charge related to component inventory held in excess of forecasted demand and to an intangible asset impairment charge of 161 million related to our 2012 restructuring activities to a lesser extent the decrease was due to an increase in the size and number of strategic contracts with lower margins and to a shift in product mix to lower margin products 

service gross margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher service revenues combined with a continuing focus on operational improvements and cost efficiencies 

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expenses in millions except percentages 



 41 

our operating expenses have historically been driven by personnelrelated costs including wages commissions bonuses vacation benefits sharebased compensation and travel and we expect this trend to continue facility and information technology “it” departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount facility and it related headcount was 396 368 and 375 as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we had a total of 9483 9234 and 9129 employees as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

we expect to initiate a substantial cost reduction plan in connection with the iop accomplished through various restructuring activities resulting in annualized operating expense savings of 160 million across research and development sales and marking and general and administrative expenses we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of future restructuring costs associated with the iop 

2013 compared to 2012 

research and development expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower depreciation expense of 283 million  attributable to the extended useful lives of computers and equipment in 2013 as well as lower prototype development costs of 186 million in addition outside services facilities and it costs decreased related to the cancellation of certain projects and facility closures the decrease in research and development expense was partially offset by increases in personnelrelated expenses primarily attributable to higher sharebased compensation expense and to a lesser extent higher variable compensation research and development headcount increased 1 from 4081 as of december 31 2012 to 4135 as of december 31 2013 additionally we continued to shift headcount to lower cost regions 

sales and marketing expense increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher personnelrelated expenses related to an increase in commission expense driven by improved sales achievement partially offset by lower sharebased compensation expense and lower outside service and travel due to our cost reduction efforts and creating efficiency in our sales activities sales and marketing headcount decreased 2 from 2680 as of december 31 2012 to 2626 as of december 31 2013 as a result of our restructuring activities 

general and administrative expense increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher litigation costs the increase in general and administrative expense was partially offset by lower personnelrelated expenses primarily sharebased compensation expense general and administrative headcount increased 6 from 486 as of december 31 2012 to 513 as of december 31 2013 to support our financerelated initiatives including our erp implementation 

restructuring and other charges decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher charges recorded in 2012 in connection with our 2012 restructuring plan during 2013 we implemented the 2013 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of 391 million related to workforce reductions contract terminations project cancellations and facility closures in connection with our plans in connection with our 2013 restructuring plan we expect to record aggregate future charges of up to 20 million related to severance charges see note 9 restructuring and other charges    in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our restructuring activities 

2012 compared to 2011 

research and development expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in engineering program costs driven by new product initiatives in the first half of the year in addition to higher variable compensation our research and development headcount decreased by 1 as of december 31 2012 to 4081 compared to 4138 as of december 31 2011 as a result of our restructuring activities in the second half of 2012 

sales and marketing expense increased slightly in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated expenses from a 4 increase in headcount from 2568 employees as of december 31 2011 to 2680 employees as of december 31 2012 as well as higher demo costs associated with bringing new products to market these increases were partially offset by lower commissions and a decrease in outside services 

general and administrative expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in outside professional services which consists of legal and consulting fees to support our financerelated initiatives including our erp implementation the increase in general and administrative expense was also attributable to the increase in general and administrative headcount which increased 5 from 463 as of december 31 2011 to 486 as of december 31 2012 

 42 

restructuring and other charges increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the 2012 restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of 2012 to bring our cost structure in line with our desired longterm financial and strategic model to a lesser extent we also incurred charges related to a restructuring plan the 2011 restructuring plan implemented in the third quarter of 2011 to align our business operations with macroeconomic and other market conditions during 2012 we incurred 468 million of restructuring and other charges related to our restructuring plans primarily for workforce reductions and facility closures 

sharebased compensation 

  

sharebased compensation expense associated with equity incentive awards awards which include stock options restricted stock units rsus restricted stock awards rsas and performance share awards psas as well as our employee stock purchase plan espp was recorded in the following cost and expense categories in millions except percentages 

2013 compared to 2012 

sharebased compensation expense remained consistent in 2013 compared to 2012 offsetting increases in expense related to rsas assumed in connection with our acquisition of contrail at the end of 2012 were decreases in actual shares vested and a decline in grant date fair values due to our lower stock prices 

2012 compared to 2011 

sharebased compensation expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a higher number of rsu awards granted as well as a change in standard vesting terms from four years to three years for those rsu awards granted in 2012 this increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock options grants valued at a lower fair value and a decrease in expense associated with psas due to lower achievement of performance targets 

other expense net and income tax provision 

the following table presents other expense net and income tax provision in millions except percentages 



other expense net 

interest income primarily includes interest income from our cash cash equivalents and investments interest expense primarily includes interest net of capitalized interest expense from our longterm debt and customer financing arrangements other typically consists of investment and foreign exchange gains and losses and other nonoperational income and expense items   

 43 

2013 compared to 2012 

interest income decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower cash balances and interest rates as well as a shift to certain investments yielding lower interest 

interest expense increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher capitalized interest in 2012 resulting from our phased campus buildout 

other expense was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher net gains recorded in 2012 related to our privatelyheld investments which included a 147 million  gain from the acquisition of our privatelyheld investment in contrail 

2012 compared to 2011 

interest income increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a higher balance of longterm investments yielding higher interest 

interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the issuance of 10 billion of our senior notes the notes near the end of the first quarter of 2011 and related interest expense of 400 million  net of capitalized interest 

in 2012 we recognized gains in other of 455 million  including a gain of 147 million  from the acquisition of our privatelyheld investment in contrail and impairment losses of 200 million  included in other related to our privatelyheld investments in 2011 other included certain legal expenses unrelated to current or recent operations of approximately 70 million  

income tax provision 

the effective rate for 2013 was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the benefit of the federal research and development rd credit a tax settlement with the internal revenue service “irs” recognition of domestic production activities deductions and earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates 

the effective tax rate for 2012 was substantially similar to the federal statutory rate of 35 the increase in the overall effective tax rate for 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the effect of changes in foreign earnings and the exclusion of the benefit for the federal rd credit which expired on december 31 2011 

the effective tax rate for 2011 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the federal rd credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates 

our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items as a result of the expiration of the federal research and development credit on december 31 2013 we expect our effective tax rate to increase in 2014 see item1a of part i risk factors of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results 

for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and further explanation of our income tax provision see note 14 income taxes  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report

2013 compared to 2012 

psd product revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher revenue from edge routing and switching products specifically due to the growth in mx ptx ex and qfabric product families as result of new products and enhancements for the enterprise campus and data center infrastructures 

a majority of our service revenues are earned from customers that purchase our products and enter into contracts for support services psd service revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to strong contract renewals for support services 

psd contribution margin as a percent of psd revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a combination of revenue growth and lower operating expenses 

2012 compared to 2011 

psd product revenues decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the decline in sales of our core and edge routing products the decline in sales was primarily attributable to lower spending by international customers and by content service provider customers in americas partially offset by an increase in sales of our switching products psd service revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to strong contract renewals for support services 

psd contribution margin as a percent of psd revenues decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decline in revenues the decrease was also attributable to a shift in product mix to lower margin products and higher prototype development costs in 2012 the decrease in contribution margin was partially offset by reduced costs as a result of a continuing focus on operational improvements and cost efficiencies

2013 compared to 2012 

ssd product revenues decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a decline in sales of security products driven by lower demand for highend srx products by service providers revenues from branch srx security products improved slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 ssd service revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily driven by strong contract renewals for support services 

ssd contribution margin as a percentage of ssd revenues decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower revenue and a decrease in gross margin partially offset by lower operating expenses 

2012 compared to 2011 

ssd product revenues decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decline in the sales of our highend and branch firewall products and routing services products partially offset by an increase in sales of our highend srx products ssd service revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily driven by strong contract renewals for support services 

ssd contribution margin as a percentage of ssd revenues remained relatively stable in 2012 compared to 2011 due to a shift in product mix to lower margin products offset by reduced costs as a result of our continued focus on operational improvements and cost efficiencies 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities the issuance of our common stock and the issuance of our longterm debt the following table shows our capital resources in millions except percentages 



 46 

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable reduced by accounts payable accrued liabilities and shortterm deferred revenue working capital increased by 838 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  primarily due to an increase in current assets primarily accounts receivable and shortterm investments and lower accounts payable partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents 

summary of cash flows 

as of december 31 2013  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 1238 million  from december 31 2012  primarily due to cash used in our investing and financing activities related to the repurchase of our common stock purchase of investments and capital expenditures 

the following table summarizes cash flows from our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions except percentages 



operating activities 

2013 compared to 2012 

cash flows from operations increased by 1999 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher consolidated net income the timing of payments to our vendors higher deferred revenue and lower taxes paid partially offset by the timing of payments for incentive compensation to our employees and the timing of collections on our outstanding receivables 

2012 compared to 2011 

cash flow from operations decreased by 3443 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower consolidated net income higher taxes paid timing of payments to our vendors and a decrease in deferred revenue offset by the timing of collections of our outstanding receivables 

investing activities 

2013 compared to 2012 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 323 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower spending on acquisitions and asset purchases as well as lower capital expenditures as we completed our phased campus buildout partially offset by higher purchases of investments 

2012 compared to 2011 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 1105 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to fewer purchases of investments offset by higher spending on asset purchases property and equipment and acquisitions during 2011 we invested the proceeds from the issuance of the notes in availableforsale securities and purchased property and equipment for the phased campus buildout of our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale ca 

financing activities 

2013 compared to 2012 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 1466 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower purchases and retirement of our common stock partially offset by an increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises as well as proceeds from customer financing arrangements 

 47 

2012 compared to 2011 

net cash used in financing activities was 5483 million in 2012 and net cash provided by financing activities was 8190 million in 2011 the change from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to the issuance of the notes in 2011 and an increase in purchases and retirement of common stock and fewer proceeds from employee stock option exercises in 2012 

stock repurchase activities and dividends 

in july 2013 our board of directors the “board” approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to 10 billion  of our common stock from time to time at managements discretion the authorization was in addition to the 10 billion  stock repurchase program approved by our board and announced in june 2012 and the 10 billion  stock repurchase program approved by the board in february 2010 as of december 31 2013  there was 9977 million  of authorized funds remaining under our stock repurchase programs 

as part of our iop announced in february 2014 we committed to return a minimum of 30 billion to shareholders over the next three years through a combination of share repurchases and dividends as part of this plan the board of directors has authorized 20 billion in share repurchases to be executed through the end of the first quarter of 2015 including 12 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program to be entered into during the first quarter of 2014 we will also initiate a quarterly cash dividend of 010 per share of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2014 with the expectation to increase the dividend over time these activities will be funded by a combination of existing cash balances and debt offerings 

the following table summarizes our repurchases and retirements of common stock under our stock repurchase programs and repurchases associated with minimum tax withholdings in millions except per share amounts 



deferred revenue 

deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to shipments to distributors that have not sold through to endusers undelivered product commitments and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue deferred service revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services which include technical support hardware and software maintenance professional services and training 

 48 

the following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues in millions 



as of december 31 2013  net deferred product revenue decreased 509 million  to 2450 million  compared to 2959 million  as of december 31 2012  primarily due to strong channel sales resulting in lower ending channel inventory and the timing of future feature releases as of december 31 2013  the increase in deferred service revenue of 1968 million  attributed the execution of several multiyear support agreements and to a lesser extent an increase in annual agreement renewals 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes it is not our business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however in the normal course of business we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance guarantees related to thirdparty customerfinancing arrangements customs and duties guarantees and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities see note 16 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our guarantees 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments debt and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 



1 see note 16 commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our contractual commitments 

2  see note 10  longterm debt and financing in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our debt 

as of december 31 2013  we had 1144 million  included in longterm income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes as a result this amount is not included in the table above

legal proceedings 

see note 16 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information on liabilities that may arise from litigation and contingencies 

liquidity and capital resource requirements   

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future 

in august 2013 we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec to replace our previous shelf registration statement which expired pursuant to sec rules in september 2013 the august 2013 automatic shelf registration statement enables us to offer for sale from time to time an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions any offerings of securities under the automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus 

we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of our common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant our intention for 2013 was to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at 275 or less of our common stock outstanding on a pure share basis where each option rsu rsa or psa granted is counted as one share based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options rsus rsas and psas we achieved the goal for 2013 in 2013 we repurchased 289 million  at a cost of 5706 million  and expect to continue to calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time we have also managed our equity compensation programs to reduce the overall number of shares subject to outstanding awards over the past two years we have reduced the use of stock options in our equity compensation programs the total number of common shares subject to our outstanding awards in connection with juniper plans was 438 million  542 million and 582 million shares as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively reflecting a consecutive decline for the three years ended december 31 2013 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund our operations iop and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including but not limited to

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk   

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility in addition as of december 31 2013  60 of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the us our marketable securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income these investments are also reviewed to identify and evaluate indications of potential otherthantemporary impairments as discussed in note 4 cash equivalents and investments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

  

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  related to the sales of our investments 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our availableforsale fixed income securities held as of december 31 2013  and 2012  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 





  

these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

  

 51 

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts   

  

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other expense net in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of one year or less 

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen approximately 76 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively in other expense net on our consolidated statements of operations the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately an increase of 08 and 15 and a decrease of 1 in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december 31 2013  and as of december 31 2012  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of nonus dollar cash cash equivalents and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10 movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in us dollars as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  by less than 1 

equity price risk   

our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities and our nonqualified deferred compensation “nqdc” plan which may also hold publiclytraded equity securities are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates 

we do not purchase our publiclytraded equity securities classified as availableforsale securities on our consolidated balance sheets for speculative purposes as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities had an estimated fair value of 1146 million  and 29 million  respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our publiclytraded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair value of 345 million and 09 million as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively 

investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  the total investments under our nqdc plan were 154 million  and 126 million  respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change on the total investments under the nqdc plan would result in a loss in the fair value of 46 million and 38 million as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively 

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies these investments are carried at cost in 2013 2012 and 2011 we recorded impairment charges of  28 million  200 million  and 18 million  respectively on our investments in privatelyheld companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in note 5 fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report the aggregate cost of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 572 million  and 320 million  as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively

our strategy 

  

our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of highperformance network infrastructure by transforming the experience and economics of networking our strategy is centered on innovation and customer value key elements of our strategy are described below 

maintain and extend technology leadership 

we are recognized around the world as an innovation leader in networking our junos os applicationspecific integrated circuit “asic” technology and networkoptimized product architecture have been key elements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership we believe that these elements can be leveraged for future products that we are currently developing we intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in research and development “rd” supplemented by external partnerships including strategic alliances and strategic acquisitions that would allow us to deliver a broad range of products and services to customers in target markets 

leverage position as supplier of highperformance network infrastructure 

we are a pure play in highperformance networking from inception we have focused on designing developing and building highperformance network infrastructure for demanding service provider and enterprise networking environments and have integrated purposebuilt technology into a networkoptimized architecture that specifically meets customer needs we believe that many customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors and that the performance reliability and security of our products will provide us with a competitive advantage which is critical to be selected as one of those vendors 

  

be strategic to our customers 

in developing our psd and ssd solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build bestinclass products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers which has enabled us to design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date we plan to continue to work handinhand with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as to design products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace while enabling customers to reduce costs we are committed to investing in rd at a level that drives our innovation agenda enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers 

enable new internet protocol ipbased services   

our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and secure networks costeffectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products we believe that the secure delivery of ipbased services and applications including web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services outsourced enterprise applications and voiceover ip will continue to grow and benefit from cost efficiencies enabled by our highperformance network infrastructure offerings by enabling these new ipbased services we have significantly broadened our service provider business over the last several years while also significantly expanding our presence in the enterprise market 

establish and develop industry partnerships 

our customers have diverse requirements while our products meet certain requirements of our customers our products are not intended to satisfy all of their requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders with diverse technologies and services that extend the value of the network to our customers these partnerships ensure that our customers have access to those technologies and services whether through technology integration joint development resale or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers requirements in addition we believe an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs 

markets and customers   

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales and through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturer “oem” partners to endusers in the following markets 

  

service providers   

service providers include wireline wireless and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers we support most major service provider networks in the world and our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance reliability and security that service providers demand we believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our service provider customers by 

 

 

 

 

while many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline wireless or cable operators in recent years we have seen increased convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships we believe these strategic developments are made technically possible as operators invest in the buildout of next generation networks capable of supporting voice video and data traffic on the same ipbased network this convergence relies on ipbased traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multiservice networks and offers service providers significant new revenue opportunities 

  

we believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions these trends include significant growth in ip traffic on service provider networks because of peertopeer interaction broadband usage video an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our ip customers and of their enterprise customers the advent of data center clouds that concentrate business applications in large ip network connected facilities and growth in mobile traffic as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including notebooks netbooks smartphones and tablets 

  

the ip infrastructure market for service providers includes products and technology at the network core the network edge to enable access the aggregation layer security to protect from the inside out and the outside in the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs and the management service awareness and control of the entire infrastructure 

enterprise   

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the worlds most demanding businesses enterprises and public sector organizations such as governments and research and education institutions that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications in addition our solutions 

 

 

 

 

as with the service provider market innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market highperformance enterprises require networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance reliability and security with bestinclass open solutions for maximum flexibility we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers branch and campus applications distributed and extended enterprises and consumer and business devices 

as customers increasingly view the network as critical to their success we believe that customers will increasingly demand fast reliable and secure access to services and applications over a single ipbased network this is partly illustrated by the success of our srx series services gateways that consolidate switching routing and security services in a single device integrated security gateway “isg” products that combine firewallvirtual private network “vpn” and intrusion detection and prevention “idp” solutions in a single platform and secure services gateway “ssg” platforms that provide a mix of highperformance security with local area networkwide area network “lan”wan connectivity for regional and branch office deployments we will continue to invest to develop these and other converged technologies and solutions 

customers with ten percent of net revenues or greater   

in 2012 and 2010 verizon communications inc accounted for 103  and 104  of net revenues respectively in 2011 no  single customer accounted for 10 or more of net revenues 

our products and technology   

  

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created 

in the last six years we have expanded our portfolio to address domains in the network the core the edge access and aggregation data centers wans campus and branch and consumer and business devices we see every domain in the network as an opportunity to provide customers with business value business efficiency and new services and applications we have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon systems and software to provide a range of solutions in highperformance networking that can solve unique problems for customers 

  

in each of the past three fiscal years routing switching security and services each accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues the following is an overview of our major product families within each of our segments 

psd products

qfx3000m  qfx3500 switch and qfx3600 switch   implements a singletier network in the data center enabling improvements in speed scale and efficiency by removing legacy barriers and improving business agility 

 

ssd products 

  

 

 

 

 

see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this report for an analysis of net product revenues by segment 

  

platform strategy   

  

in addition to our major product families our extended software portfolio known as junos platform is a key technology element in our strategy to be the leader in highperformance networking the junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers the junos platform includes the following products 

   

 

 

   

junos os is designed to maintain continuous systems and improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades this operational efficiency allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenuegenerating applications helping to advance the economics of highperformance networking 

the security and stability of junos os combined with its modular architecture and single source code base provides a foundation for delivering performance reliability security and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments with an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage junos os including routing switching and security products we believe junos os provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors 

   

major product development projects   

  

we continue to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio which resulted in new product offerings during 2012 including a smaller version of our qfabric solutions the latest qfx3000m qfabric system t4000 core routers and ptx series packet transport switches additionally we experienced new customer wins contributing to the growth in the ex series mx series and srx series we launched the new acx series router with support for both ethernet accessaggregation and mpls which extends network intelligence closer to the subscriber and features an open standardsbased management system with software development kit sdkenabled programmability to enable rapid thirdparty innovation we also announced new products and features in our simply connected portfolio including srx series services gateways and wla series wireless lan access points which simplify and secure mobile device access to enterprise networks furthermore we acquired mykonos web security software in february 2012 to complement our network security applications portfolio 

additionally we announced innovative products to enable service providers to rapidly deliver and expand new consumer and business services these products include our mx2020 and mx2010 3d universal edge routers and new junosv app engine which enable service providers to transform the network edge into a platform for rapid service deployment we also launched the junos content encore with mx application services modular line card which enables the delivery of premium content services over broadband connections across multiple device types furthermore we announced a technology partnership with riverbed technology inc riverbed that provides us with new capabilities for application delivery control in exchange for juniper providing wan acceleration technology to riverbed along with promoting riverbed as its wan optimization provider of choice going forward 

customer service 

  

in addition to our psd and ssd products we offer support professional and educational services we deliver these services directly to our channel partners and to endusers and utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and thirdparty organizations as appropriate 

  

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of support professional and educational services to ensure these services are locally delivered 

  

as of december 31 2012  we employed 1301  people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services 

  

manufacturing and operations   

  

as of december 31 2012  we employed 318  people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor and manage product testing and quality 

  

as of december 31 2012  we have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity with celestica incorporated flextronics international ltd plexus corporation plexus and accton technology during the fourth quarter of 2012 we confirmed an initiative to reduce the number of our contract manufacturers in this regard we confirmed the disengagement of plexus as a contract manufacturer which we expect to complete in 2013 

our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers in the united states us china malaysia mexico and taiwan our contract manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

 

 

 

our contract manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors vars or endusers generally we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components remain unused or the products remain unsold for specified period we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

  

although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis 

  

we also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical component supplies the majority of our inventory is production components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly in light of current macroeconomic conditions and the resulting uncertainties in future product demand 

our asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources such as international business machines corporation “ibm” each of which is responsible for all aspects of asics production using our proprietary designs 

  

by working collaboratively with our suppliers we have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted a supplier code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers one element of our supplier code of conduct is adoption and compliance with the electronic industry code of conduct “eicc” the eicc outlines standards to promote ethical business practices eliminate human trafficking and ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe workers are treated with respect and dignity and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible 

research and development 

  

we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols software applications and platforms and embedded operating systems as of december 31 2012  we employed 4081 people in our worldwide rd organization 

  

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications integrating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings in our psd and ssd products we are leveraging our software asic and systems technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers applications and continuing to develop technology to support the anticipated growth in ip network requirements we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

our rd process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our rd team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market expenditures for rd were  11016 million  10268 million  and 9179 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

  

sales and marketing 

  

as of december 31 2012  we employed 2680 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

  

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals system engineers and marketing and channel teams is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers within each team sales team members serve the following three geographic regions i americas including united states canada mexico caribbean and central and south america ii emea and iii apac within each region there are regional and country teams as well as major account teams to ensure we operate close to our customers 

see note 13 segments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for information concerning our revenues by geographic regions and by significant customers which is incorporated herein by reference our international operations subject us to certain risks and uncertainties see item 1a of part i “risk factors” for more information 

  

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below 

  

in the united states and canada we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers almost all of our sales outside the united states and canada are made through our channel partners 

  

direct sales structure 

  

our sales team engages with enduser customers with which we have direct relationships the terms and conditions of these arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgment of those orders or by purchase contracts the direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

channel sales structure 

  

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales we employ various channel partners including but not limited to 

 

 10 

   

we have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly with channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a relationship with certain strategic enduser customers while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of product through our channel partners 

  

backlog 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2012  and 2011  our total product backlog was approximately 4105 million  and 3007 million  respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers generally within the next six months and excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sellthrough to endusers certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts 

seasonality   

  

we as do many companies in our industry experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first and third quarters historically we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

  

competition 

  

psd business 

  

in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc cisco has historically been the dominant player in the market however our principal competitors also include alcatellucent brocade communications systems inc brocade extreme networks inc extreme networks hewlett packard company hp and huawei technologies co ltd huawei 

  

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco alcatellucent hp and huawei bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

  

ssd business 

  

in the market for ssd products cisco generally is our primary competitor with its broad range of products in addition there are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines within ssd including check point software technologies ltd check point f5 networks inc f5 networks fortinet inc fortinet and palo alto networks inc palo alto networks these additional competitors tend to be focused on single product line solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

  

for both product groups we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco alcatellucent and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products there continues to be consolidation in this industry with smaller 

companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue 

  

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

  

environment   

  

we are subject to regulations that have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulations adopted by the european union and china in addition we participate in the carbon disclosure project “cdp” cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors it hosts one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data in the world at wwwcdprojectnet we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis we believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world 

  

to date compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

in addition we are committed to the environment by our effort in improving the energy efficiency of key elements in our highperformance network product offerings in 2012 we launched a set of carrierclass mpls switches the ptx5000 series in addition to filling the capacity and density requirement for internet core growth ptx5000 also features record energy efficiency of 15w per gigabit of throughput the environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business 

  

intellectual property   

  

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise 

  

while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

  

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

as of december 31 2012  our worldwide patent portfolio included over 1700 patents patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary 

  

employees   

  

as of december 31 2012  we had 9234 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our future successes also depend on our continuing ability to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition for such key personnel is intense and in order to attract and retain these personnel we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and sharebased compensation our sharebased incentive awards include stock options restricted stock units rsus restricted stock awards rsas and performance share awards psas some of which contain conditions relating to our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such sharebased incentive awards does not materialize if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel could be weakened there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

investments in our securities involve significant risks the market price of our stock has historically reflected a higher multiple of earnings than many other companies accordingly even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered in the past significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors disclosed by us including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our business operating results and stock price 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

the factors that may cause our quarterly results to vary quarter by quarter and be unpredictable include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in the mix of products and services sold changes in geographies in which our products and services are sold changing market and economic conditions current and potential customer consolidation competition customer concentration long sales and implementation cycles regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example we and many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending particularly in the first and third quarters market trends competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations 

as a result of these factors as well as other variables affecting our operating results we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below our guidance our longterm financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses in addition economic uncertainty concerns over the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the european union as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world have and may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions which has led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products to delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects andor higher costs of production economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore continued weakness and the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the european union may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the short and medium term 

uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and there is an ongoing trend toward consolidation in the industry in which our customers and partners operate any decrease in revenues from our customers or partners could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners for example verizon accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues in 2010 and 2012 changes in the business requirements vendor selection financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior including product mix purchased of our key customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in recent years there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example the acquisitions of global crossing by level 3 communications and qwest communications by centurylink and softbanks proposed purchase of a controlling interest in sprint nextel and that consolidation trend has continued if our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay suspend or indefinitely reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or other unforeseen consequences could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

a customers decision to purchase certain of our products particularly new products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times both of which may be exacerbated by the impact of continued global economic weakness may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competition is intense in the markets that we address the psd market has historically been dominated by cisco with competition coming from other companies such as alcatellucent brocade extreme networks hewlett packard company and huawei in the ssd market we face intense competition from a broader group of companies such as check point cisco f5 networks palo alto networks and fortinet further a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all for example oracles proposed acquisition of acme packet inc in 2013 and ciscos acquisition of meraki networks inc in 2013 a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and the level of product gross margins achieved by us in recent years may not be sustainable 

we expect our product gross margins to vary from quartertoquarter and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including customer product and geographic mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete increases in material or labor costs increases in inventory carrying costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract 

manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if we do not accurately forecast product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures for example in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 our margins declined as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

if we receive product orders late in a quarter we may be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our quarterly revenues 

generally our psd products are not stocked by distributors or resellers due to their cost and complexity and configurations required by our customers and we generally build such products as orders are received in recent years the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter has generally continued to increase but remains unpredictable if orders for certain products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to build ship and recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter additionally we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

  

during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited any future growth in our business it spending and the economy in general is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed for example from time to time we have experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of product shipments we currently purchase numerous key components including asics from single or limited sources the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules also longterm supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may further increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

we rely on valueadded and other resellers as well as distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded and other reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm and nsn the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products and some of which sell their own products that compete with our products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our valueadded resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues for example in 2006 one of our largest resellers lucent was acquired by alcatel a competitor of ours as a result of the merger lucent became a competitor their resale of our products declined and we ultimately terminated our reseller agreement with lucent our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners 

are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and scale and improve our processes and procedures that support the channel as a result our programs processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage we have previously entered into oem agreements with partners pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the programs processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers or other partners as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed for example although it did not adversely affect our shipments an earthquake in late december of 2006 disrupted our communications with china where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs 

we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example as we have expanded our contract manufacturing base to china we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturer was not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

telecommunications companies and our other large customers generally require more onerous terms and conditions in our contracts with them as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

  

telecommunications service provider companies which comprise a significant portion of our customer base and other large companies because of their size generally have greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms from others which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions from us recently france telecomorange and deutsche telekom ag have formed a company for the purpose of purchasing products from and negotiating more favorable contractual terms with suppliers as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

  

in addition telecommunications service providers have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our security products which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price 

  

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy increasingly companies including juniper networks are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis despite our security measures juniper networks information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to penetration or attacks by computer programmers and hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen which could subject us to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and cause us reputational and financial harm in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks 

if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our security products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed because the techniques used by computer programmers and hackers many of whom are highly sophisticated and wellfunded to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions in addition the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the programmer or hacker which are often difficult to identify 

regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects 

the traditional telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the internet telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks but future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the internet and internet service provider access charges we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service or content providers regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or content providers could adversely affect those customers needs for products designed to enable a wide range of such services or business models for instance the us federal communications commission has issued regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks these regulations might impact service provider and content provider business models and as such providers needs for internet telecommunications equipment and services also many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security supply chain integrity privacy and data protection any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment 

in addition environmental regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations may impact our business and financial condition adversely for instance the european union and china have adopted weee and rohs regulations which require producers of electrical and electronic equipment to assume responsibility for collecting treating recycling and disposing of products when they have reached the end of their useful life as well as reach regulations which regulate handling of certain chemical substances that may be used in our products in addition some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria even though those criteria may be in conflict with accepted international standards these regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the adoption and implementation of such regulations could reduce demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products result in product inventory writeoffs impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner and require us to spend significant time and expense to comply and we could face fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues 

certain of our products contain or use encryption technology the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export among other things encryption technology in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring certification notifications review of source code or the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys for example russia and china recently have implemented new requirements relating to products containing encryption and india has imposed special warranty and other obligations associated with technology deemed critical governmental regulation of encryption or ip networking technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in harm to our reputation penalties costs and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or governmentfunded projects 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future technological shifts market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such technological shifts needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all for example the move from traditional network infrastructures towards software defined networks sdn has been receiving considerable attention in our view it will take several years to see the full impact of sdn and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine hardware and software elements together if we fail to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to meet those needs in a timely manner it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance 

in addition as a result of our acquisitions of altor and trapeze in 2010 we have been offering a virtualization security product and a wlan product also in 2012 we announced new products including the smaller version of our qfabric solutions the latest qfx3000m qfabric system t4000 core routers ptx series packet transport switches mx2020 and mx2010 3d universal edge routers and junosv app engine if these or other new products do not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected in addition if we fail to achieve market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets and aspirations may be adversely affected finally if we fail to deliver new or announced products to the market in a timely manner it could adversely affect the market acceptance of those products and harm our competitive position and our business and financial results 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement costs related to intercompany restructurings tax effects of sharebased compensation or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject 

to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we receive preliminary notices of deficiency or notices of proposed adjustments from the irs claiming that we owe additional taxes plus interest and possible penalties for example we received a preliminary notice of deficiency in 2011 and one in 2009 for prior tax years based on transfer pricing transactions related to the license of acquired intangibles under an intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement as a result of the preliminary notices of deficiency received in 2011 and 2009 the incremental tax liability would be approximately 920 million and 8070 million excluding interest and penalties respectively we believe the irs position with regard to these matters is inconsistent with applicable tax laws judicial precedent and existing treasury regulations and that our previously reported income tax provisions for the years in question are appropriate however there can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in our favor regardless of whether these matters are resolved in our favor the final resolution of these matters could be expensive and timeconsuming to defend andor settle while we believe we have provided adequately for these matters there is a possibility that an adverse outcome of these matters individually or in the aggregate could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers and the manufacturers order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins for example in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 our gross margins were reduced as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time and because our contract manufacturers are thirdparty manufacturers for numerous other companies if we underestimate our requirements as we did in the third quarter of 2010 with respect to certain components our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products which could increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships which includes failing to provide accurate forecasts of our requirements or if one or more of them experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in other countries in addition in late 2012 we confirmed that we were reducing the number of our contract manufacturers as a result we will be transitioning the work of one manufacturer to two of our other existing manufacturers during 2013 if we do not manage that transition effectively we could experience delays or quality issues each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

upgrades to key internal systems and processes and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with and therefore harm our business and operations 

we previously initiated a multiyear project to upgrade certain key internal systems and processes including our companywide human resources management system our customer relationship management “crm” system and enterprise resource planning “erp” system in the first quarter of 2010 we implemented a major upgrade of our crm system in 2012 and continuing into 2013 we expect to implement major changes to our erp system we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes any disruptions or 

delays in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide service and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner file sec reports in a timely manner or otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more costly than anticipated our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we are a party to lawsuits proceedings and other disputes which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay damages or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits we have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters commercial transactions and patent infringement as well as securities laws a description of the securities lawsuits can be found in note 16 commitments and contingencies    in notes to consolidated financial statements of this report under the heading “legal proceedings” there can be no assurance that these or any actions that have been or may in the future be brought against us our officers and our directors will be resolved favorably or that tentative settlements will become final regardless of whether they are resolved these lawsuits are and any future lawsuits or threatened legal proceedings to which we our officers or our directors may become a party will likely be expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve legal proceedings threatened legal proceedings or investigations regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation costs of defense as well as any losses resulting from these claims or settlement of these claims could significantly increase our expenses and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights resolution of which may be time  consuming and expensive as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies or enter into license agreements furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights 

we generally rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently now pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings and other competitive harm furthermore the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions 

in periods of market expansion we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in rd sales and marketing and other parts of our business 

conversely in the third quarter of 2012 to align our cost structure with longterm strategic plans as part of our productivity and efficiency initiatives we restructured our business rebalanced our workforce and reduced our real estate portfolio many of our expenses such as real estate expenses are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees moreover rapid changes in the size of our workforce could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes or if other unforeseen events occur our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

we are required to test annually and review on an interim basis our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives including the goodwill associated with acquisitions to determine if impairment has occurred as of december 31 2012  our goodwill was  40578 million  and our intangible assets were 1289 million  if goodwill or intangible assets are deemed impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized this would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred for example such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock falls below certain levels for a sustained period or if the portions of our business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at expected rates or decline in the second quarter of 2006 our impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of 12800 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately nine months prior to the impairment review and to a lesser extent a decrease in forecasted future cash flows in the third quarter of 2012 our impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of 54 million to the carrying value of certain purchased intangibles on our consolidated balance sheets primarily due to the decline in discounted cash flow projections in recent years economic weakness contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours future declines in our stock price as well as declines in our level of revenues or gross margins increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets however any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and vars in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the united states in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 

  

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including the following 

 

 23 

 

   

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors channel partners and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro indian rupee and japanese yen related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars and a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities however such attempts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations are costly and no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances including longterm declines in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business for example in 2012 we acquired contrail systems inc contrail and mykonos and in 2010 we acquired altor trapeze smobile and ankeena acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of managements attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired business if we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders use a substantial portion of our cash resources assume liabilities record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur 

amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors or malware or do not meet customer quality expectations our business could be adversely affected and we may be subject to lawsuits or be required to pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers any errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in monetary penalties loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and reputation penalties and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition in the event an error defect malware or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed moreover if our products fail to satisfy our customers quality expectations for whatever reason the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the failure to comply with the terms of any license including free open source software may result in our inability to continue to use such license our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us if possible to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow then our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the buildout of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when the customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception our stock price and cause us to incur additional expense 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions may be adversely affected if our financial statements are not reliable and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at december 31 2012  we had 24078 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 14296 million  in short and longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in assetbacked securities certificate of deposit commercial paper corporate debt securities foreign government debt securities government sponsored enterprise obligations money market funds mutual funds publiclytraded equity securities and us government securities certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by us subprime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues at many financial institutions our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to generate the cash flow to service our debt obligations including the senior notes 

in march   2011 we issued senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principle amount of 10 billion see discussion in note 10 longterm debt and financing  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to service our indebtedness including the notes or to make anticipated capital expenditures our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance which will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control based upon current levels of operations we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness including the senior notes however if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt we may be required to sell assets reduce capital expenditures refinance all or a portion of our existing debt including the senior notes or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the indenture that governs the senior notes also contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 26 

 

 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business a failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default in addition in the event of an acceleration we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments including those under the senior notes 

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” in the course of operating our business we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices the collection of receivables the manufacturing and shipment of products the fulfillment of orders the purchase of supplies and the building of inventory and spare parts among other matters each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period in making these decisions we consider various factors including contractual obligations customer satisfaction competition internal and external financial targets and expectations and financial planning objectives the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates see note 2 significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report and our “critical accounting policies and estimates” section included in this “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item 7 our “risk factors” section included in item 1a of part i and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 of part ii of this report 

business and market environment 

at juniper networks we design develop and sell products and services that together provide our customers with a highperformance network infrastructure built on simplicity security openness and scale we serve the highperformance networking requirements of global service providers enterprises governments and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success our core competencies in hardware systems silicon design network architecture and our open crossnetwork software platform are helping customers achieve superior performance greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership 

we do business in three geographic regions americas emea and apac beginning in the first quarter of 2012 we aligned our organizational structure to focus on our platform and software strategy which resulted in two business segments organized principally by product families psd and ssd our psd segment primarily offers scalable routing and switching products that are used in service provider enterprise and public sector networks to control and direct network traffic between data centers core edge aggregation campus wans branch and consumer and business devices our ssd segment offers software solutions focused on network security and network services applications for both service providers and enterprise customers both segments offer worldwide services including technical support and professional services as well as educational and training programs to our customers 

we remain focused on a common vision for the new network and we believe that the organizational structure we have in place will effectively drive our innovative portfolio and support our customers nextgeneration network requirements together our highperformance product and service offerings help our customers to convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation value increased performance reliability and security to endusers we remain dedicated to uncovering new ideas and innovations that will serve the exponentially increasing demands of the networked world and we will endeavor to continue to build solutions that center on simplification automation and open innovation 

during 2012 we saw moderate growth in some of our primary markets we continued to experience an uncertain global macroeconomic environment in which our customers exercised care and conservatism in their investment prioritization and project deployments we expect that our customers will continue to remain cautious with their capital spending in the near term we also continued to experience declining product gross margins and pricing pressures from our competitors we believe our product gross margins may continue to decline in the future offset by operational improvements and cost efficiencies nevertheless we are focused on executing our strategy to address the market trends of mobile internet and cloud computing and we continue to see positive longterm fundamentals for highperformance networking 

we continue to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio which resulted in new product offerings during 2012 including a smaller version of our qfabric solutions the latest qfx3000m qfabric system t4000 core routers ptx series packet transport switches additionally we experienced new customer wins contributing to the growth in the ex series mx series and srx series we launched the new acx series router with support for both ethernet accessaggregation and mpls which extends network intelligence closer to the subscriber and features an open standardsbased management system with software development kit sdkenabled programmability to enable rapid thirdparty innovation we also announced new products and features in our simply connected portfolio including srx series services gateways and wla series wireless lan access points which simplify and secure mobile device access to enterprise networks furthermore we acquired mykonos web security software in february 2012 to complement our network security applications portfolio 

additionally we announced innovative products to enable service providers to rapidly deliver and expand new consumer and business services these products include our mx2020 and mx2010 3d universal edge routers and new junosv app engine which enable service providers to transform the network edge into a platform for rapid service deployment we also launched the junos content encore with mx application services modular line card which enables the delivery of premium content services over broadband connections across multiple device types furthermore we announced a technology partnership with riverbed technology inc riverbed that provides us with new capabilities for application delivery control in exchange for juniper providing wan acceleration technology to riverbed along with promoting riverbed as its wan optimization provider of choice going forward 

throughout 2012 we focused on improved operational execution continued innovation and prudent capital allocation we continue to believe that the underlying trends driving network investment around the cloud and mobility are intact and remain strong during 2012 we also initiated a variety of actions to ensure we are positioned for the future resulting in a restructuring plan the 2012 restructuring plan to bring our cost structure more in line with our desired longterm financial and strategic model the 2012 restructuring plan consists of workforce reductions facility consolidations or closures and supply chain and procurement efficiencies in connection with the 2012 restructuring plan we recorded costs of 404 million for workforce reductions facility consolidations or closures and other charges during 2012 we also recorded certain inventory charges intangible asset impairment charges and contract termination costs of 529 million we expect to incur charges related to the 2012 restructuring plan through the end of fiscal 2013 we continue to anticipate that our restructuring and cost reduction activities will result in approximately 1500 million in cost reduction savings primarily in operating expenses and to a lesser extent in both product and service cost of revenues for the full year 2013 in comparison to our 2012 full year levels see note 9 restructuring and other charges    in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our restructuring activities 

on january 24 2013 we communicated the following five principles that provide insight on our operating plans for 2013 

 these five principles are based on our managements plans assumptions and expectations as of the date of this report although we believe we have been prudent in our plans expectations and assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially

critical accounting policies and estimates   

  

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources note 2 significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

 

we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for carrying charges quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete material charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers to meet our demand forecasts or customer orders we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability as of december 31 2012 and 2011 our contract manufacturer liabilities were 277 million and 148 million respectively 

significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory and obsolete material exposures if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and contract manufacturer liabilities which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 

 35 

and product base and the expected use of the acquired assets these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 

the value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as but not limited to a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate b a substantial decline in our market capitalization c an adverse action or assessment by a regulator d unanticipated competition e loss of key personnel f a more likelythannot expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof g a realignment of our resources or restructuring of our existing businesses in response to changes to industry and market conditions h testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit or i higher discount rate used in the impairment analysis as impacted by an increase in interest rates 

we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of november 1 st  or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment level by comparing the reporting units carrying value including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using significant judgment based on a combination of the income and the market approaches under the income approach we estimate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of forecasted future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting units to values of publiclytraded companies in similar lines of business if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill when the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows operating trends riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocated shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units as of december 31 2012  goodwill recorded for our psd segment and ssd segment was 18663 million  and 21915 million  respectively the fair value of our reporting units in particular ssd are sensitive to events or changes in circumstances such as adverse changes in operating results or macroeconomic conditions changes in managements business strategy or declines in our stock price a hypothetical 5 decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would result in the fair value of our ssd segment to be above its carrying value by approximately 1 and the fair value of our psd segment to be in excess of its carrying value by approximately 80 see item 1a of part i risk factors for more information 

we evaluate longlived assets such as property plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such events or changes in circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset a longlived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if a longlived asset is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group

under our revenue recognition policies we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price “esp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles when determining esp we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years we applied esp to the majority of our product revenue and vsoe to our service revenue in 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

we utilize the blackscholesmerton “bsm” optionpricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options and espp the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected award life and riskfree interest rate the expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options the expected life of an award is based on historical experience we determine the fair value of rsus rsas and psas based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant in addition we use significant judgment in estimating sharebased compensation expense for our psas based on the vesting criteria and only recognize expense for the portions in which annual targets have been set 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent managements best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our sharebased compensation expense could be materially different in the future additionally we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as judgment and recognize expense only for those expectedtovest shares if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate our recorded sharebased compensation expense could be different 

  

 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

results of operations 

the following table presents product and service in millions except percentages 



the decrease in product revenues in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to a decline in sales of our core and edge legacy routing and firewall products partially offset by an increase in our switching and highend srx products our 2012 revenues reflect initial sales from the introduction of our t4000 ptx and acx routing products the increase in service revenues in 2012 was primarily driven by strong contract renewals compared to 2011 for certain edge routing switching and security products 

the increase in product revenues in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in sales of our edge routing and switching products partially offset by decreases in core routing and highend firewall products our 2011 revenues reflect initial sales from the introduction of our qfabric solution the increase in service revenues in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to sales and contract renewals for certain edge routing switching and security products 

net revenues by market and customer 

the following table presents net revenues by market in millions except percentages 



we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings from both our psd and ssd segments to two primary markets service provider and enterprise determination of which market a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customers industrial classification code but may also include subjective factors such as the intended use of the product the service provider market generally includes wireline wireless and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers including those that provide social networking and search engine services the enterprise market generally comprises businesses federal state and local governments and research and education institutions 

net revenues from sales to the service provider market decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to reduced routing purchases by some of our international and content service providers partially offset by strong growth from tier 1 carrier service providers in the americas net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in 2011 compared to 2010 across all of our geographic regions specifically in the americas and emea the increase was largely attributable to customers adoption of our routing and switching products 

net revenues generated from the enterprise market decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower revenue in federal and financial services offset by our expanding presence in apac and emea net revenues generated from the enterprise market increased in 2011 compared to 2010 across all three geographic regions the increase reflecting demand for both routing and switching products was driven by the value proposition we offer to customers as well the expansion of our presence in the global enterprise market 

in 2012 and 2010 verizon communications inc accounted for 103  and 104  of our net revenues respectively in 2011 no single customer accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues 

net revenues by geographic region 

the following table presents net revenues by geographic region in millions except percentages 



net revenues in the americas increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increased sales in the united states to certain service providers offset by a decline in the enterprise market particularly among federal and financial services customers net revenues in the americas increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased sales in the united states attributable to the demand for our routing and switching products and services from enterprise and service provider customers 

net revenues in emea decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to decreased sales in western and southern europe as a result of the challenging economic climate in those areas the decrease was partially offset by increased revenues in the middle east and from a top service provider in eastern europe across a broad range of our product portfolio the increase in net revenues in emea in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven by service provider and enterprise demand for our routing and switching products and related services in both the service provider and enterprise markets the increases were largely attributable to sweden eastern europe and the netherlands in addition we recognized the first revenue from a top service provider in eastern europe across a broad range of our product portfolio 

net revenues in apac decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in sales to a certain service provider customer in japan following a large product deployment that occurred in 2011 this decrease was partially offset by growth in china in the enterprise market net revenues in apac increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the increase in revenues from both service provider and enterprise markets net revenues also increased in southeast asia and australia in 2011 compared to 2010 partially offset by continued weakness in japan and a deferral of some demand in china 

gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



product gross margin percentage decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a 443 million  inventory charge related to component inventory held in excess of forecasted demand and to an intangible asset impairment charge of 161 million related to our 2012 restructuring activities as discussed in note 8 other financial information  and   note 7 goodwill and purchased intangible assets  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report to a lesser extent the decrease was due to an increase in the size and number of strategic contracts with lower margins and to a shift in product mix to lower margin products product gross margin percentage decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a lower proportion of router revenue a shift in the geographic mix of revenue from the americas and increased fixed overhead and inventoryrelated costs from 2010 through 2012 our product gross margins have declined we expect this trend to continue into 2013 due to a shift in product mix and pricing pressures offset in part by innovation and cost efficiencies 

service gross margin percentage increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher service revenues combined with a continuing focus on operational improvements and cost efficiencies service gross margin percentage decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a growth in headcount for service and support resources for our expanded product portfolio we expect service gross margins to remain relatively stable in 2013 

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expenses in millions except percentages 



our operating expenses have historically been driven by personnelrelated costs including wages commissions bonuses vacation benefits sharebased compensation and travel and we expect this trend to continue facility and information technology “it” departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount facility and it related headcount was 368 375 388 as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we had a total of 9234 9129 and 8772 employees as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the yearoveryear increase in total operating expenses in 2012 was primarily driven by an increase in personnelrelated costs of 812 million primarily from salaries benefits higher variable compensation and sharebased compensation offset by lower commissions and headcount growth and an increase in engineering program costs of 122 million 

rd expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in engineering program costs driven by new product initiatives in the first half of the year in addition to higher variable compensation our rd headcount decreased by 1 as of december 31 2012 to 4081 compared to 4138 as of december 31 2011 as a result of our restructuring activities in the second half of 2012 rd expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated expenses also contributing to the increase was higher consulting facilities and it costs associated with our rd projects to support our new product initiatives including the data center mobility and core solutions this increase was partially offset by lower variable compensation in 2011 

sales and marketing expense increased slightly in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated expenses from a 4 increase in headcount from 2568 employees as of december 31 2011 to 2680 employees as of december 31 2012 as well as higher demo costs associated with bringing new products to market these increases were partially offset by lower commissions and a decrease in outside services sales and marketing expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated expenses also contributing to the increase in 2011 was an increase in commission expense driven by higher revenues and an increase in outside services incurred to support our sales and marketing activities 

general and administrative ga expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in outside professional services which consists of legal and consulting fees to support our financerelated initiatives including our erp implementation ga headcount increased 5 from 463 as of december 31 2011 to 486 as of december 31 2012 ga expense was relatively flat in 2011 compared to 2010 as costs associated with the ga headcount growth of 3 from 449 at december 31 2010 to 463 at december 31 2011 were largely offset by lower variable compensation 

amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 as certain purchased intangible assets reached the end of their amortization period during 2011 partially offset by the addition of purchased intangible assets from 

acquisitions completed during 2012 amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the addition of purchased intangible assets from acquisitions during 2011 and 2010 

restructuring and other charges increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to a restructuring plan the 2012 restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of 2012 to bring our cost structure in line with our desired longterm financial and strategic model we also incurred charges related to a restructuring plan the 2011 restructuring plan implemented in the third quarter of 2011 to align our business operations with macroeconomic and other market conditions during 2012 we incurred 468 million of restructuring and other charges related to our restructuring plans primarily for workforce reductions and facility closures restructuring and other charges increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to 153 million of charges related to workforce reductions and 135 million in other charges primarily related to the impairment of an abandoned inprocess internal use software project 

acquisitionrelated charges decreased during 2012 compared to 2011 due to a lower number and size of acquisitions completed in 2012 compared to both 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010 in 2011 and 2010 we recorded 71 million and 63 million respectively in direct and indirect acquisitionrelated costs such as financial advisory legal due diligence and integration costs from acquisitions completed in 2011 and 2010 see note 3 business combinations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of these acquisitions 

sharebased compensation 

  

sharebased compensation expense associated with stock options espp rsus rsas and psas was recorded in the following cost and expense categories in millions except percentages 

sharebased compensation expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a higher number of rsu awards granted as well as a change in standard vesting terms from four years to three years for those rsu awards granted in 2012 this increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock options grants valued at a lower fair value and a decrease in expense associated with psas due to lower achievement of performance targets sharebased compensation expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the increase in awards granted driven by headcount growth and higher fair value of equity awards attributable to the increase in the market value of our common stock for those awards 

other expense income net and income tax provision 

the following table presents other expense income net and income tax provision in millions except percentages 



interest income primarily includes interest income from our cash cash equivalents and investments interest income increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a higher balance of longterm investments yielding higher interest interest income decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a lower balance of longterm investments yielding lower interest interest expense primarily consists of interest from our longterm debt and customer financing arrangements interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the issuance of 10 billion of our senior notes the notes near the end of the first quarter of 2011 and related interest expense of 400 million  net of capitalized interest interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to 377 million  of interest expense net of capitalized interest on the notes see note 10 longterm debt and financing  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of the notes other typically consists of investment and foreign exchange gains and losses and other nonoperational income and expense items in 2012 we recognized gains of 455 million  including a gain of 147 million  from the acquisition of our privatelyheld investment in contrail and impairment losses of 200 million  included in other related to our privatelyheld investments in 2011 other included certain legal expenses unrelated to current or recent operations of approximately 70 million in 2010 we recognized a total gain of 87 million within other primarily due to acquisitions of our privatelyheld investments in ankeena and altor 

our effective tax rates were 360  257  204  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the effective rate for 2012 is substantially similar to the federal statutory rate of 35 the effective rate for 2012 does not reflect the benefit of the federal rd credit which expired on december 31 2011 on january 2 2013 the president signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which retroactively extended the federal rd credit for two years through december 31 2013 as a result we expect to record a favorable benefit of approximately170 million to 190 million in the first quarter of 2013 from the retroactive renewal of the 2012 federal rd credit 

the increase in the overall effective tax rate for 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to the effect of changes in foreign earnings the expiration of rd credit on december 31 2011 and a 541 million income tax benefit in 2010 resulting from a change in our estimate of unrecognized tax benefits due to the taxpayer favorable ruling by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit in xilinx inc v commissioner related to sharebased compensation 

the effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the federal rd credit the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates and the change in our estimate of unrecognized tax benefits as noted above 

for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35  and further explanation of our income tax provision see note 14 income taxes  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and the issuance of our common stock and more recently the issuance of the notes the following table shows our capital resources in millions except percentages 



the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable reduced by accounts payable accrued liabilities and shortterm deferred revenue working capital decreased by 7943 million in the year ended december 31 2012  primarily due to a higher cash and cash equivalent balance at december 31 2011 as a result of the issuance of the notes in march 2011 and a decrease in accounts receivables offset by decreases in accounts payable and shortterm deferred revenue 

summary of cash flows 

as of december 31 2012  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 5026 million from december 31 2011  this decrease was mainly the result of cash used in our investing and financing activities of 5967 million and 5483 million respectively offset by 6424 million generated from operating activities 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6424 million  9867 million  and 8123 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010 respectively cash flows from operations decreased by 3443 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower consolidated net income higher taxes paid timing of payments to our vendors and a decrease in deferred revenue offset by the timing of collections on our outstanding receivables 

cash flows from operations increased by 1744 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the onetime litigation settlement payment of 1693 million in 2010 which did not occur in 2011 the increase was partially offset by lower consolidated net income in 2011 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 5967 million  7072 million  and 5327 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010 respectively the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to fewer purchases of investments offset by higher spending on asset purchases property and equipment and acquisitions during 2011 we invested the proceeds from the issuance of the notes in availableforsale securities and purchased property and equipment for the phased campus buildout of our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale ca we expect our capital expenditures to decrease in 2013 as we complete our phased campus buildout 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 5483 million and 724 million in 2012 and 2010 respectively and net cash generated from financing activities was 8190 million  in 2011  the change from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to the issuance of the notes in 2011 and an increase in purchases and retirement of common stock and fewer proceeds from employee stock option exercises in 2012 we generated additional cash from financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the issuance of the notes partially offset by the repurchase of our outstanding common stock for further discussion of our longterm debt see note 10 longterm debt and financing  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

stock repurchase activities 

in june 2012 our board of directors the “board” approved a stock repurchase program the 2012 stock repurchase program which authorized us to repurchase up to 10 billion  of our common stock the 2012 stock repurchase program was in addition to the stock repurchase program approved by the board in february 2010 the “2010 stock repurchase program” which authorized us to repurchase up to 10 billion of our common stock the 2010 stock repurchase program authorization was in addition to the stock repurchase program approved by the board in march 2008 which also enabled us to repurchase up to 10 billion of our common stock 

we repurchased and retired approximately 358 million  shares of our common stock at an average price of 1805  per share for an aggregate purchase price of 6456 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  under our stock repurchase programs as of december 31 2012  there were 5682 million  authorized funds remaining under our stock repurchase programs we expect to continue to calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time 

restructuring 

as of december 31 2012  we accrued total restructuring charges of approximately 182 million  related to our 2012 and 2011 restructuring plans of which approximately 106 million  related to severance costs that are expected to be paid through the third quarter of fiscal 2013 the remaining 76 million  in facilitiesrelated and other charges are expected to be paid through march 2018 during 2012 we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling approximately 331 million  for severance costs facility closures and contract terminations 

deferred revenue 

deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to shipments to distributors that have not sold through to endusers undelivered product commitments and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue deferred service revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services which include technical support hardware and software maintenance professional services and training 

the following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues in millions 



total deferred revenue decreased 436 million  to 9234 million as of december 31 2012  compared to 9670 million as of december 31 2011  this is due to a decline in deferred service revenue driven by timing of revenue recognition partially offset by an increase in net deferred product revenue

we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant our intention for fiscal year 2012 was to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at 275 or less of our common stock outstanding on a pure share basis where each option rsu rsa or psa granted is counted as one share with psas counted at their target amount based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options rsus and psas we achieved the goal for 2012 in fiscal year 2012 as a result of stock price weakness we increased our repurchase activity and expect to continue to calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time we have also managed our equity compensation programs to reduce the overall number of shares subject to outstanding awards over the past two years notably we have reduced the use of stock options in our equity compensation programs the total number of common shares subject to our outstanding awards in connection with juniper plans was 542 million  582 million and 635 million shares as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively reflecting a consecutive decline for the three years ended december 31 2012 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments which includes the proceeds of the issuance of the notes together with cash generated from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk   

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility in addition as of december 31 2012  57 of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held outside of the us our marketable securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss these investments are also reviewed to identify and evaluate indications of potential otherthantemporary impairments as discussed in note 4 cash equivalents and investments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report 

  

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  related to the sales of our investments 

  

the following tables presents hypothetical changes in fair value of our availableforsale fixed income securities held as of december 31 2012  and 2011  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 





  

these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

  

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts   

  

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other expense income net in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of one year or less 

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen approximately 77 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively in other expense income net on our consolidated statements of operations the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue rd sales and marketing and ga expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 15 1 and 1 in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

if overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the us dollar uniformly change by 10 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in us dollars as of december 31 2012  and 2011  would change by less than 1 assuming constant foreign currency cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

  

equity price risk   

  

our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities and our nonqualified deferred compensation “nqdc” plan which may also hold publiclytraded equity securities are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates our publiclytraded equity securities are classified as availableforsale securities on our consolidated balance sheets investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets we do not purchase our publiclytraded equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes as of december 31 2012  and 2011  the total investments under the nqdc plan were 126 million and 93 million respectively a 

hypothetical 30 adverse change on the total investments under the nqdc plan as of december 31 2012  and 2011  would result in an immaterial loss 

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies these investments are carried at cost in 2012 and 2011 we recorded impairment charges of  200 million  and 18 million respectively on our investments in privatelyheld companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in note 5 fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report there were no such charges in 2010 the aggregate cost of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 320 million  and 518 million  as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively

our strategy 

  

our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of highperformance network infrastructure by transforming the experience and economics of networking our strategy is centered on innovation and customer value key elements of our strategy are described below 

maintain and extend technology leadership 

we are recognized around the world as the innovation leader in networking our junos os applicationspecific integrated circuit “asic” technology and networkoptimized product architecture have been key e lements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership we believe that these elements can be leveraged for future products that we are currently developing we intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in research and development “rd” supplemented by external partnerships including strategic alliances and strategic acquisitions that would allow us to deliver a broad range of products and services to customers in target markets 

leverage position as supplier of highperformance network infrastructure 

we are a pure play in highperformance networking from inception we have focused on designing developing and building highperformance network infrastructure for demanding service provider and enterprise networking environments and have integrated purposebuilt technology into a networkoptimized architecture that specifically meets customer needs we believe that many customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors and that the performance reliability and security of our products will provide us with a competitive advantage which is critical to be selected as one of these vendors 

  

be strategic to our customers 

in developing our infrastructure and slt solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build bestinclass products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers which has enabled us to design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date we plan to continue to work handinhand with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as to design products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace while enabling customers to reduce costs we are committed to investing in rd at a level that drives our innovation agenda enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers 

enable new ipbased services   

our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and secure networks costeffectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products we believe that the secure delivery of ipbased services and applications including web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services outsourced enterprise applications and voiceover ip will continue to grow and benefit from cost efficiencies enabled by our highperformance network infrastructure offerings by enabling these new ipbased services we have significantly broadened our service provider business over the last several years while also significantly expanding our presence in the enterprise market 

establish and develop industry partnerships 

our customers have diverse requirements wh ile our products meet certain requirements of our customers our products are not intended to satisfy all of their requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders with diverse technologies and services that extend the value of the network to our customers these partnerships ensure that our customers have access to those technologies and services whether through technology integration joint development resale or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers requirements in addition we believe an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs 

markets and customers   

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales and through distributors valueadded resellers and original equipment manufacturer “oem” partners to endusers in the following markets 

  

service providers   

service providers include wireline wireless and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers we support most major service provider networks in the world and our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance reliability and security that service providers demand we believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our service provider customers by 

 

 

 

 

while many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline wireless or cable operators in recent years we have seen a move towards convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships we believe these strategic developments are made technically possible as operators invest in the build out of next generation networks capable of supporting voice video and data traffic on to the same ipbased network this convergence relies on ipbased traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multiservice networks and offer service providers significant new revenue opportunities 

  

we believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions these trends include significant growth in ip traffic on service provider networks because of peertopeer interaction broadband usage video an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our ip customers and of their enterprise customers the advent of datacenter clouds that concentrate business applications in large ip network connected facilities and growth in mobile traffic as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including notebooks netbooks smartphones and tablets 

  

the ip infrastructure market for service providers includes products and technology at the network core the network edge to enable access the aggregation layer security to protect from the inside out and the outside in the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs and the management service awareness and control of the entire infrastructure 

enterprise   

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the worlds most demanding businesses enterprises and public sector organizations such as governments and research and education institutions that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications in addition our solutions 

 

 

 

 

as with the service provider market innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market highperformance enterprises require networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance reliability and security with bestinclass open solutions for maximum flexibility we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers branch and campus applications distributed and extended enterprises and wide area network “wan” gateways 

as customers increasingly view the network as critical to their success we believe that customers will increasingly demand fast reliable and secure access to services and applications over a single ipbased network this is partly illustrated by the success of our srx services gateways that consolidate switching routing and security services in a single device integrated security gateway “isg” products that combine firewallvirtual private network “vpn” and intrusion detection and prevention “idp” solutions in a single platform and secure services gateway “ssg” platforms that provide a mix of highperformance security with local area network “lan”wan connectivity for regional and branch office deployments we will continue to invest to develop these and other converged technologies and solutions 

customers with ten percent of net revenues or greater   

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of the companys total net revenues for 2011 verizon communications inc accounted for greater than 10 of our total net revenues in 2010 att inc accounted for greater than 10 of our total net revenues in 2009 

  

our products and technology   

  

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created 

our infrastructure products are designed to address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless access by combining highperformance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a networkoptimized solution in addition as enterprises continue to develop and rely upon more sophisticated and pervasive internal networks we believe the need for products with highperformance routing and switching technology is expanding to a broader set of customers and we believe our expertise in this technology well positions us to address this growing market opportunity 

  

additionally our slt segment offers a broad family of network security solutions that deliver highperformance costeffective security for enterprises service providers and government entities including integrated firewall and vpn solutions secure sockets layer “ssl” vpn appliances and idp appliances we also offer complementary products and technologies to enable our customers to provide additional ipbased services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and applications 

  

the following is an overview of our major infrastructure and slt product families

platform strategy   

  

in addition to our major product families our extended software portfolio known as junos platform is a key technology element in our strategy to be the leader in highperformance networking the junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers the junos platform includes 

   

 

 

   

junos os is designed to maintain continuous systems and improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades this operational efficiency 

allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenuegenerating applications helping to advance the economics of highperformance networking 

the security and stability of junos os combined with its modular architecture and single source code base provides a foundation for delivering performance reliability security and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments with an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage junos os including routing switching and security products we believe junos os provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors 

 

   

major product development projects   

  

during 2011 we introduced our network architecture and fabric technology for the data center qfabric that enables customers to scale their network faster and achieve significant improvement in performance and released the three core components of qfabricthe node interconnect and director we unveiled converged supercore solution the ptx series an integrated packet transport system that enables service and content providers to accommodate new levels of peak bandwidth demand we expect to begin shipping our ptx series switches toward the end of the first quarter of 2012 we also released the t4000 core router a multichassis capable system that delivers 4tbps of traffic in a single half rack routing node our software is a key differentiator that drives customer adoption of our solutions we introduced our mobilenext software releasing the ggsn and p gateway and s gateway for mobile operators we also announced junos pulse mobile security suite support on android devices apple ios devices the vgw virtual gateway virtualized security solution for private and public clouds and the integration of vgw with our srx platform as well as the security design application on junos space platform for developing and deploying network applications additionally we launched junosphere a cloud offering that allows network operators to create and run networks ondemand and delivered an openflow application built on the junos software developer kit to expand the available toolset for enhancing network flexibility and programmability 

  

customer service 

  

in addition to our infrastructure and slt products we offer support professional and educational services we deliver these services directly to endusers and utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and thirdparty organizations as appropriate 

  

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of support professional and educational services to ensure these services are locally delivered 

  

as of december 31 2011 we employed 1289  people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services 

  

manufacturing and operations   

  

as of december 31 2011 we employed 296  people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor and manage product testing and quality 

  

we have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity with celestica incorporated flextronics international ltd plexus corporation and accton technology our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers in the united states china malaysia mexico and taiwan 

our contract manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

 

 

 

our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or endusers generally we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components remain unused or the products remain unsold for specified period we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

  

although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis 

  

we also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to ensure adequate component supplies the majority of our inventory is production components as a result we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges particularly in light of current macroeconomic conditions and the resulting uncertainties in future product demand 

  

our asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources such as international business machines corporation “ibm” each of which is responsible for all aspects of asics production using our proprietary designs 

  

by working collaboratively with our suppliers we have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted and promote other to adoption the electronic industry code of conduct “eicc” the eicc outlines standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe workers are treated with respect and dignity and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible 

research and development   

  

we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols software applications and platforms and embedded operating systems as of december 31 2011 we employed 4138 people in our worldwide rd organization 

  

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications integrating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings in our infrastructure and slt products we are leveraging our software asic and systems technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers applications and continuing to develop technology to support the anticipated growth in ip network requirements we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

  

our rd process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our rd team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market expenditures for rd were 10268 million  9179 million  and 7417 million  in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

sales and marketing   

  

as of december 31 2011 we employed 2568 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

  

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals system engineers and marketing and channel teams is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers within each team sales team members serve the following three geographic regions i americas including united states canada mexico and central and south america ii europe middle east and africa “emea” and iii asia pacific “apac” within each region there are regional and country teams as well as major account teams to ensure we operate close to our customers 

see note 13 segment information  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning our revenues by geographic regions and by significant customers which is incorporated herein by reference our operations subject us to certain risks and uncertainties associated with international operations see item 1a of part i “risk factors” for more information 

  

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below 

  

in the united states and canada we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers almost all of our sales outside the united states and canada are made through our channel partners 

  

direct sales structure 

  

our sales team engages with customers with which we have direct relationships the terms and conditions of these arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgment of those orders or by purchase contracts the direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

channel sales structure   

  

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we do the majority of our sales we employ various channel partners including but not limited to 

 

 

 

   

in addition to our sales that are direct to customers or that are made entirely through channel partners we have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly with channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a direct relationship with our more strategic enduser customers while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of product through our channel partners 

backlog   

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2011 and 2010 our total product backlog was approximately 301 million  and 330 million  respectively our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers generally within the next six months  and excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sellthrough to endusers certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals sales return reserves service revenue allocations and early payment discounts 

seasonality   

  

many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first and third quarters in addition our slt segment generally experiences seasonally strong customer demand in the fourth quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance

in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc cisco has historically been the dominant player in the market however other companies such as alcatellucent brocade communications systems inc brocade extreme networks inc hewlett packard company hp and huawei technologies co ltd huawei are also our principal competitors 

  

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco alcatellucent hp and huawei bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

  

slt business   

  

in the market for slt products cisco generally is our primary competitor with its broad range of products in addition there are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines within slt including check point software technologies f5 networks in c palo alto networks inc and r iverbed technology inc these additional competitors tend to be focused on single product line solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

  

for both product groups we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco alcatellucent and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products there continues to be consolidation in this industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue 

  

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

  

environment   

  

we are subject to regulations that have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulations adopted by the european union in addition we participate in the carbon disclosure project “cdp” cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors it hosts one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data in the world at wwwcdprojectnet we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis we believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world 

  

to date compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

in addition we are committed to the environment by our effort in improving the energy efficiency of key elements in our highperformance network product offerings for example our t1600 router consumes substantially less energy than competitive products the environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business 

  

intellectual property   

  

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise 

  

while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

  

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

as of december 31 2011 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 1300 patents patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms on the individual patents vary 

  

employees   

  

as of december 31 2011 we had 9129 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

  

our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition for suc h key personnel is intense and in order to attract and retain these 

personnel we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and sharebased compensation our sharebased incentive awards include stock options restricted stock units and performance share awards some of which contain conditions relating to our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such sharebased incentive awards does not materialize if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel could be weakened there can be no assuran ce that we can retain our key personnel in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

investments in our securities involve significant risks the market price of our stock has historically reflected a higher multiple of earnings than many other companies accordingly even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered in the past significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our stock price 

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

the factors that may cause our quarterly results to be unpredictable include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in the mix of products and services sold changes in geographies in which our products and services are sold changing market and economic conditions current and potential customer consolidation competition customer concentration long sales and implementation cycles regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending particularly in the first and third quarters 

as a result of these risk factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have resulted in certain historical periods and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings and could make it difficult to forecast sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses in addition economic weakness particularly in the united states and europ e concerns over the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the european union the downgrade by standard and poors sp of the us longterm sovereign credit rating as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions which could lead to reduced demand for our products andor higher costs of production continued economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore the continued weakness and uncertainty in worldwide credit markets including the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the european union may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays  or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the short and medium term 

uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenues from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners changes in the business requirements vendor selection financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior including product mix purchased of our key customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in recent years there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example the acquisitions of global crossing and qwest communications and atts failed acquisition of tmobile and that consolidation trend has continued if our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or other unforeseen cons equences could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we receive product orders late in a quarter we may be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our quarterly revenues 

generally our infrastructure products are not stocked by distributors or resellers due to their cost and complexity and configurations required by our customers and we generally build such products as orders are received in recent years the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter has generally continued to increase but remains unpredictable if orders for certain products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to build ship and recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter additionally we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

a customers decision to purchase certain of our pro ducts particularly new products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be length y in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 

competition is intense in the markets that we address the infrastructure market has historically been dominated by cisco with competition coming from other companies such as alcatellucent brocade extreme networks hewlett packard company and huawei in the slt market we face intense competition from a broader group of companies such as check point cisco f5 netwo rks palo alto networks and riverbe d in addition a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions in this regard ericsson acquired redback in 2007 and brocade acquired foundry networks in 2009 a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

we expect our product gross margins to vary from quartertoquarter and the gross margins we have recently achieved may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including product mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete increases in material or labor costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if we do not accurately forecast product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 

we rely on valueadded and other resellers as well as distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded and other reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm and nsn the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our valueadded resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues for example in 2006 one of our largest resellers lucent was acquired by alcatel a competitor of ours as a result of the merger lucent became a competitor their resale of our products declined and we ultimately terminated our reseller agreement with lucent our competitors may in some cases be effective in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support it and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage for example in 2009 we entered into an oem agreement with ibm pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers or other partners as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed for example although it did not adversely affect our shipments an earthquake in late december of 2006 disrupted our communications with china where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs 

we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example as we have expanded our contract manufacturing base to china we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturer was not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

telecommunications companies and our other large customers generally require more onerous terms and conditions in our contracts with them as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

  

telecommunications service provider companies and other large companies because of their size generally have greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions from us france telecomorange and deutsche telekom ag have formed a company for the purpose of purchasing products from and negotiating more favorable contractual terms with suppliers as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be r equired to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

  

for example customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result this class of customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

  

during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited any future growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed for example from time to time including the first quarter of 2008 we experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of product shipments we currently purchase numerous key components including asics from single or limited sources the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

system security risks data protection breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our proprietary information disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our security products which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price 

  

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy increasingly companies including juniper networks are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis despite our security measures juniper networks information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to penetration or attacks by computer programmers and hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks 

if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our security products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed because the techniques used by computer programmers and hackers many of whom are highly sophisticated and wellfunded to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques this could impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions in addition the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the programmer or hacker which are often difficult to identify 

regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects 

the traditional telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the internet telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks but future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the internet and internet service provider access charges we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service or content providers regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or content providers could adversely affect those customers needs for products designed to enable a wide range of such services or business models for instance the us federal communications commission has issued regulation s governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks these regulations might impact service provider and content provider business models and as such providers needs for internet telecommunications equipment and services in addition many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security privacy and data protection which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment 

in addition environmental regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations may impact our business and financial condition adversely for instance the european union has adopted weee rohs and reach regulations in addition some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria even though those criteria may be in conflict with accepted international standards similar regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business 

the adoption and implementation of such regulations could decrease demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products and impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues 

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring certification notifications review of source code or the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys for example russia and china recently have implemented new requirements relating to products containing encryption and india has imposed special warranty and other obligations associated with technology deemed critical governmental regulation of encryption or ip networking technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in penalties costs and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or government funded projects 

if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all if we fail to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to meet those needs in a timely manner it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no 

assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance 

for example in connection with the acqui sitions of altor and trapeze in 2010 we are now offering a virtualization security product and a wlan product additionally in 2011 we announced our new data center product the qfabric™ solution our mobility solutions with our mobilenext software and our converged supercore product which converges the optical and packet layers of the network if these or other new products do not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected in addition if we fail to achieve market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets and aspirations may be adversely affected in addition if we fail to deliver new or announced products to the market in a timely manner it could adversely affect the market acceptance of those products and harm our competitive position and our business and financial results 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement tax effects of sharebased compensation costs related to intercompany restructurings or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

from time to time we receive preliminary notices of deficiency or notices of proposed adjustments from the irs claiming that we owe additional taxes plus interest and possible penalties for example we received a preliminary notice of deficiency in 2011 and one in 2009 for prior tax years based on transfer pricing transactions related to the license of acquired intangibles under an intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement as a result of the preliminary notices of deficiency received in 2011 and 2009 the incremental tax liability would be approximately 920 million and 8070 million excluding interest and penalties respectively we believe the irs position with regard to these matters is inconsistent with applicable tax laws judicial precedent and existing treasury regulations and that our previously reported income tax provisions for the years in question are appropriate however there can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in our favor regardless of whether these matters are resolved in our favor the fin al resolution of these matters could be expensive and timeconsuming to defend andor settle while we believe we have provided adequately for these matters there is a possibility that an adverse outcome of these matters individually or in the aggregate could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers and the manufacturers order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time if we underestimate our requirements as we did in the third quarter of 2010 with respect to certain components our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products which could increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and 

result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in other countries each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

upgrades to key internal systems and processes and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with and therefore harm our business and operations 

we previously initiated a multiyear project to upgrade certain key internal systems and processes including our companywide human resources management system our customer relationship management “crm” system and enterprise resource planning “erp” system in the first quarter of 2010 we implemented a major upgrade of our crm system we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes any disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide service and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner file sec reports in a timely manner or otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more costly than anticipated our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we are a party to lawsuits proceedings and other disputes which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay damages or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits we have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters commercial transactions and patent infringement as well as securities laws a description of the securities lawsuits can be found in note 15 commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” there can be no assurance that these or any actions that have been or may in the future be brought against us our officers and our directors will be resolved favorably or that tentative settlements will become final regardless of whether they are resolved these lawsuits are and any future lawsuits or threatened legal proceedings to which we our officers or our directors may become a party will likely be expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve legal proceedings threatened legal proceedings or investigations regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation costs of defense as well as any losses resulting from these claims or settlement of these claims could significantly increase our expenses and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights resolution of which may be time  consuming and expensive as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies or enter into license 

agreements furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions in periods of market expansion we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in rd sales and marketing and other parts of our business as we have in the 2010 fiscal year and in the first quarter of 2011 conversely during 2009 in response to downward trending industry and market conditions we restructured our business rebalanced our workforce and reduced our real estate portfolio many of our expenses such as real estate expenses cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted because of fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees moreover rapid changes in the size of our workforce could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in c ountries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the united states in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 

  

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including changes in general it spending the imposition of government controls including critical infrastructure protection changes or limitations in trade protection laws other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws natural disasters epidemic disease labor unrest earnings expatriation restrictions misappropriation of intellectual property military actions acts of terrorism political and social unrest and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations for example revenue attributable to our customers in japan generally accounts for five percent to eight percent of our revenue although we did not experience a significant negative impact to our revenue during fiscal year 2011 the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan may continue to adversely and unpredictably affect our customers and spending patterns in japan in the short term any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others t o engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated 

in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro indian rupee and japanese yen related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars and a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities however no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances including longterm declines in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business for example in december 2010 we acquired altor and trapeze in july 2010 we acquired smobile and in april 2010 we acquired ankeena acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of managements attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assu rance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired business if we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders assume liabilities record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

we are required to test annually and review on an interim basis our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any future acquisitions to determine if impairment has occurred as of december 31 2011 our goodwill was 39281 million  if such assets are deemed impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized this would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred for example such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock falls below certain levels for a sustained period or if the portions of our business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at expected rates or decline in the second quarter of 2006 our impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of 12800 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our balance sheet for the slt operating segment primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately nine months prior to the impairment review and to a lesser extent a decrease in forecasted future cash flows in recent years economic weakness contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that reduced the market price of many technology company stocks 

including ours future declines in our stock price as well as any marked decline in our level of revenues or gross margins increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors or do not meet customer quality expectations our business could be adversely affected and we may need to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers any errors defects malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and reputation penalties and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition in the event an error defect malware or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harm ed moreover if our products fail to satisfy our customers quality expectations for whatever reason the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do  not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the failure to comply with the terms of any license may result in our inability to continue to use such license our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us if possible to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow then our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the build out of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when the customers are determining the design 

of those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions may be adversely affected if our financial statements are not reliable and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at december 31 2011 we had 29104 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 13820 million  in short and longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in us government securities governmentsponsored enterprise obligations foreign government debt securities corporate notes and bonds commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by us subprime mortg age defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues at many financial institutions our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to generate the cash flow to service our debt obligations including the senior notes 

in march   2011 we issued senior unsecured notes for an aggregate princi ple amount of 10 billion we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to service our indebtedness including the notes or to make anticipated capital expenditures our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt obligations refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance which will be affected by general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control based upon current levels of operations we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness including the senior notes however if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt we may be required to sell assets reduce capital expenditures refinance all or a portion of our existing debt including the senior notes or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the indenture that governs the senior notes also contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

   

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs accordingly these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business a failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default in addition in the event of an acceleration we may not have or 

be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments including those under the senior notes 

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” in the course of operating our business we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices the collection of receivables the manufacturing and shipment of products the fulfillment of orders the purchase of supplies and the building of inventory and spare parts among other matters each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period in making these decisions we consider various factors including contractual obligations customer satisfaction competition internal and external financial targets and expectations and financial planning objectives the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 1 of part i of this annual report on form 10k and our “critical accounting policies and estimates” section included in this “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item 7 our “risk factors” section included in item 1a of part i and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in item 8 of part ii of this report 

business and market environment 

at juniper networks we  focus on architecting the new network we design develop and sell products and services that together provide our customers with a highperformance network infrastructure built on simplicity security openness and scale we serve the highperformance networking requirements of global service providers enterprises governments and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success our broad product portfolio spans routing switching security application acceleration identity policy and control and network management to provide customers high performance greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership 

we do business in three geographic regions americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” and our operations are organized into two reportable segments infrastructure and service layer technologies “slt” our infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable routing and switching products that are used to control and direct network traffic from the core through the edge aggregation and the customer premise equipment level as well as a complete wireless local area network wlan solution that provides high reliability performance security and management for mobile applications our slt segment offers solutions that meet a broad array of our customers priorities from protecting the network itself and data on the network to maximizing existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications across a distributed network both segments offer worldwide services including technical support under maintenance contracts and professional services as well as educational and training programs to our customers 

over the past two years we have aligned our organization around a common vision for the new network together our highperformance product and service offerings help our customers to convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation value and increased performance reliability and security to endusers we remain dedicated to uncovering new ideas and innovations that will serve the exponential demands of the networked world and we will continue to build solutions that center on simplification automation and open innovation 

during 2011 we continued to experience a challenging macroeconomic environment the effect of the increased macro volatility escalated especially over the second half of the year due to sovereign debt concerns in europe as well as slow down of the economies in apac and in the americas a number of our largest us customers including tier 1 service providers and financial service firms reduced their spend toward the end of the year additionally our customers held off their core routing purchases in anticipation of the t4000 series launch as we entered into a new product cycle despite the impact from the nearterm challenges our revenue grew in 2011 the investments we have made in rd are delivering on a wave of new products from our new offerings in the data center qfabric to enterprise mobility and to our converged supercore routing technology the three core components of qfabricthe node interconnect and director were released the next wave of mobilenext features including the s gateway for mobile operators were announced during the year our converged supercore solution ptx series switches are expected to begin shipment in the first quarter of 2012 and the t4000 core router commenced shipment in the fourth quarter of 2011 in addition we have put the right organization structure in place to effectively drive our innovative portfolio and support our customers nextgeneration network requirements 

in the coming year we will remain focused on balancing the longerterm needs of the business while remaining agile and prudent with our spending in the short term we believe the underlying fundamentals of our business remain healthy and we are focused on executing our strategy to address the market trends of mobile internet and cloud computing we believe our strategy aligns well with the driving forces of the network we believe innovation will drive longterm value creation in the networking industry as customers forgo the complexity and unnecessary costs of old architectures and embrace open systems that can scale across the multiple dimensions of network growth with our strategy our innovation pipeline and the deeper penetration in both service provider and enterprise markets we plan to navigate the challenging nearterm environment in 2012 based on the following five operating principles

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

 

under our revenue recognition policies we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if available or estimated selling price “esp” if neither vsoe nor third party evidence tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles when determining esp we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years we apply esp to the majority of our product revenue and vsoe to our service revenue in 2011 and 2010 

 34 

components which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times as of december 31 2011 and 2010 our contract manufacturer liabilities were 148 million  and 227 million  respectively 

 

 

we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of november 1 st  or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment level by comparing the reporting units carrying value including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using significant judgment based on a combination of the income and the market approaches under the income approach we estimate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of forecasted future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting units to values of publiclytraded companies in similar lines of business if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill when the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference determining the fair value of a reporting unit or a indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows operating trends riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocated shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units as of december 31 2011  goodwill recorded for our slt segment and infrastructure segment was 22826 million  and 16455 million  respectively a hypothetical decrease of 5 in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would result in excess fair value over carrying value of approximately nil for our slt segment to 73 billion for our infrastructure segment 

we evaluate longlived assets such as property plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such events or changes in circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the fair value of the 

underlying asset or asset group a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset a longlived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if a longlived asset is considered to be impaired the i mpairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

  

 

we utilize the blackscholesmerton “bsm” optionpricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options and espp the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected award life and riskfree interest rate the expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options the expected life of an award is based on historical experience the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees and the potential effect from options that have not been exercised we determ ine the fair value of rsus and psas based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date in addition we use significant judgment in estimating sharebased compensation expense for our psas based on the vesting criteria and only recognize expense for the portions in which annual targets have been set 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent managements best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our sharebased compensation expense could be materially different in the future additionally we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as judgment and recognize expense only for those expectedtovest shares if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate our recorded sharebased compensation expense could be different 

  

 

estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income to the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized through the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and future income we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets in the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged to earnings in the period such determination is made similarly if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable the respective valuation allowance is reversed resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 

  

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with 

a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

  

   

from time to time we are involved in disputes litigation and other legal actions we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other thirdparty claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation andor substantial settlement charges in addition the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods if any of those events were to occur our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses for a discussion of current litigation please see under the heading legal proceedings in note 15 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k

net revenues by market and customer 

the following table presents the total net revenues by market in millions except percentages 



we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings from our infrastructure and slt segments to two primary markets – service provider and enterprise determination of which market a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customers industrial classification code but may also include judgmental factors such as the intended use of the product the service provider market generally includes wireline wireless and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers including those that provide social networking and search engine services the enterprise market generally comprises businesses federal state and local governments and research and education institutions 

net revenue increased in 2011 attributable to the increase in sales to the service provider market across all three geographic regions specifically in the americas and emea regions the increase was largely attributable to customers adoption of our infrastructure products including the mx series routers ex series switches and wlan products across all three regions slightly offset by a decline in the slt products in the americas

gross margins 

the following table presents gross margins in millions except percentages 



product gross margin percentage decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a lower proportion of router revenue a shift in the geographic mix of revenue from americas increased fixed overhead and inventoryrelated costs as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had 296  and 273  employees respectively in our manufacturing and operations organization that primarily manage relationships with our independent contract manufacturers manage our supply chain orchestrate new product introductions and monitor and manage product testing and quality

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in millions except percentages 



personnelrelated costs including wages commissions bonuses vacation benefits sharebased compensation and travel have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue facility and information technology “it” departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount facility and it related headcount was 375  388  and 294  as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we had 9129  8772  and 7231 employees as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the yearoveryear increase in 2011 was due to growth across all of our organizations as a result of our efforts to grow the business 

rd expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated expenses of 757 million also contributing to the increase was higher consulting facilities and it costs associated with our rd projects to support our new product initiatives including the data center mobilityand core solutions this increase was partially offset by lower variable compensation in 2011 our rd headcount was relatively flat at 4138 as of december 31 2011 compared to the prior year as a result of our restructuring activities in the second half of 2011 

rd expenses increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to additional headcount and strategic initiatives to expand 

our product portfolio in particular we focused on delivering optical capabilities and a packetoptimized transport system that will help service providers better support packet and ipbased services such as video mobility and cloud computing personnelrelated costs increased 1116 million in 2010 primarily due to a 25 increase in headcount in our engineering organization from 3308 to 4132 employees to support product innovation intended to capture anticipated future network infrastructure growth and opportunities additionally our outside consulting facilities and it costs related to rd expenses increased to support our rd efforts 

sales and marketing expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010  primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated expenses of 1285 million additionally contributing to the increase in 2011 was an increase in commission expense driven by higher revenue and an increase in outside services incurred to support our sales and marketing activities as a result of our restructuring activities in the second half of 2011 sales and marketing headcount increased only 4  from 2466  employees as of december 31 2010 to 2568  employees as of december 31 2011 

sales and marketing expenses increased in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to our 2010 advertising campaign events for new product launches and an increase in personnelrelated costs of 958 million the increase in personnelrelated costs was primarily due to a 17 increase in our sales and marketing headcount from 2101 to 2466 employees an increase in variable compensation driven by growth in our revenues and an increase in outside services to support our sales and marketing programs as a percentage of net revenues sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly in 2010 due to our focus on managing expenses and creating efficiency in our sales activities

sharebased compensation 

  

sharebased compensation expense associated with stock options employee stock purchases restricted stock units rsus and performance share awards psas was recorded in the following cost and expense categories in millions except percentages 

sharebased compensation expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the increase in award grants driven by headcount growth and higher fair value of equity awards attributable to the increase in the market value of our common stock for those awards sharebased compensation expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in rsu and psa grants during the period primarily resulting from an increase in the number of participants 

other income and expense net and income tax provision 

the following table presents other income and expense net and income tax provision in millions except percentages 



interest income primarily includes interest income from our cash cash equivalents and investments interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the 377 million interest expense on the debt issued in march 2011 other typically consists of investment and foreign exchange gains and losses and other nonoperational income and expense items in 2011 other included certain legal expenses unrelated to current or recent operations of approximately 70 million  in 2010 we recognized a total gain of 87 million primarily due to acquisitions of our privatelyheld equity investments in ankeena and altor during 2009 we recognized an impairment loss of 55 million on our equity investments for changes in fair value that we believed were otherthantemporary 

our effective tax rates were 257  204 and 631 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the effective rate for 2011 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the federal rd credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates the effective tax rate for 2011 differed from 2010 as a result of the items referenced below which were recognized in 2010 

the decrease in overall rate in 2010 compared to 2009 and the federal statutory rate of 35 was primarily due to the federal rd credit the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates and a 541 million income tax benefit in 2010 resulting from a change in the companys estimate of unrecognized tax benefits due to the taxpayer favorable ruling by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit the “court” in xilinx inc v commissioner  related to sharebased compensation 

  

the effective tax rate in 2009 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following income tax charges i a 618 million discrete and other related charge that resulted from changes in california income tax laws that were enacted during 2009 ii a 521 million charge that resulted from a change in our unrecognized tax benefits related to share 

based compensation and iii a 46 million charge which related to an investigation by the india tax authorities the effective rate impact from these charges was partially offset by the federal rd credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates

select segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 is as follows in millions except percentages and units 

infrastructure 



 

 

in 2011 infrastructure products revenue increased across all three regions in both the service provider and enterprise markets these increases were primarily from sales of our routing and switching products such as mx series routers ex series switches and wlan the increase in infrastructure service revenue in 2011 was primarily driven by strong contract renewals for support services and increased installed base from our infrastructure product sales 

infrastructure operating income decreased as a percent of infrastructure revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 was largely due to the decline in product margins and higher operating expenses partially offset by lower variable compensation in 2011 

we track infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth most of our infrastructure product platforms are modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform each modular chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces the modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module chassis revenue units 

represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2011 compared to 2010  primarily due to the increase in shipments of our mx series routers particularly the midrange mx product lines the increase in shipments of the midrange mx product lines which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis drove the higher number of ports shipped in 2011 compare to 2010 

in 2010 infrastructure products revenue experienced growth in the enterprise and service provider markets across all regions compared to 2009 this increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our mx series routers and ex series switches the increased demand for our products was primarily due to growing network demand attributable to increased reliance on digital devices connected to the network and to a lesser extent the improved macroeconomic environment 

infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2010 compared to 2009 which was commensurate with infrastructure product revenue growth during the year infrastructure port shipments increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the continued growth in sales of mx series products which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis 

a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers that purchase our products and enter into support services contracts for support infrastructure service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 which was primarily driven by increased revenue from new product sales and strong contract renewals for support services from a geographical and market perspective the increase in infrastructure service revenues was primarily due to an increase in enterprise business across all regions and service provider business in the emea and apac regions these increases were partially offset by a decrease in service revenue in the americas service provider market 

infrastructure operating income increased as a percent of infrastructure revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a higher gross margin percentage which was attributable to changes in product mix that favored higher margin products additionally although infrastructure sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers they decreased as a percentage of infrastructure revenues 

slt 



 

 

slt product revenues decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 which was largely driven by a decrease in revenue from our highend srx highend firewall and branch firewall products partially offset by an increase in our branch srx revenue the decline was primarily experienced in the americas service provider market although slt product revenue decreased in 2011 revenue units increased due to the higher sales of our lower priced branch products 

the increase in slt service revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily driven by strong contract renewals for support services in both the service provider and enterprise markets across all regions 

slt operating income decreased as a percent of revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to decline in revenue and shift to lower margin products 

we experienced an increase in slt product revenue in the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to increased demand for our branch and highend srx service gateway products from a geographical and market perspective we experienced revenue growth in the americas service provider market and across all regions in the enterprise market in 2010 

slt revenue units increased in 2010 compared to 2009 which was commensurate with growth in slt product revenue the percentage increase in slt revenue units was less than the increase in slt product revenues due to a product mix that favored higher average selling prices 

the increase in slt service revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily driven by increased revenue from new product sales and strong contract renewals for support services from a geographical and market perspective the increase in slt service revenues was due to growth in the enterprise and service provider markets across all regions 

slt operating income increased as a percent of revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percent of slt revenue as we continued our efforts to carefully manage costs additionally the increase was attributable to higher gross margin percentage resulting from changes in product mix and efficiencies achieved from the higher 2010 revenues 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and the issuance of our common stock and more recently the issuance of longterm debt the following table shows our capital resources in millions except percentages and days sales outstanding 



 

nm  not meaningful 

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable reduced by accounts payable accrued liabilities and shortterm deferred revenue working capital increased by 12306 million  in the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to a higher cash and cash equivalent balance as a result of our 10 billion debt offering in march 2011 

summary of cash flows 

as of december 31 2011  our cash and cash equivalents increased by 10985 million  from december 31 2010  this increase was mainly the result of cash generated by our operating and financing activities of 9867 million  and 8190 million  respectively partially offset by cash used in investing activities of 7072 million  

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 9867 million  8123 million  and 7961 million  for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively cash flows from operations increased by  1744 million  in 2011 compared to the prior year primarily due to the onetime litigation settlement payment of 1693 million  in 2010 which did not occur in 2011 the increase was partially offset by lower consolidated net income in 2011 for 2010 operating cash flows increased by 162 million from 2009 primarily due to higher consolidated net income partially offset by litigation settlement payments prepaid taxes and higher accounts 

receivable 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 7072 million  5328 million  and 9483 million  in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively during 2011 we invested the proceeds from our march 2011 debt offering in availableforsale securities and purchased property and equipment for the buildout of our new headquarter campus in sunnyvale ca the change in net cash used in investing activities from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to net cash paid for acquisitions in 2010 

financing activities 

net cash generated in financing activities was 8190 million  in 2011 and net cash used were 724 million  and 2622 million  for 2010 and 2009 respectively we generated additional cash from financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the issuance of our longterm debt on march 5 2011 partially offset by the repurchase of our outstanding common stock for further discussion of our longterm debt see note 10 financing  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

in 2010 we used additional cash in financing activities to repurchase our outstanding common stock through our stock repurchase programs partially offset by cash proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees as a result of higher stock prices 

stock repurchase activities 

in february 2010 our board of directors the board approved a stock repurchase program the “2010 stock repurchase program” which authorized us to repurchase up to 10 billion of our common stock this authorization was in addition to the stock repurchase program approved by the board in march 2008 the “2008 stock repurchase program” which also enabled us to repurchase up to 10 billion of our common stock 

we repurchased and retired approximately 175 million  shares of our common stock at an average price of 3093  per share for an aggregate purchase price of 5412 million  during the year ended december 31 2011  under our 2010 stock repurchase program as of december 31 2011  there were no  remaining authorized funds under the 2008 stock repurchase program and 2138 million  remaining authorized funds under the 2010 stock repurchase program 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2011 and 2010 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments tax liabilities and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions

and on purchase orders we have received from our customers generally we do not own the components and title to the product transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders as of december 31 2011  we had accrued 148 million  based on our estimate of such charges total purchase commitments as of december 31 2011  consisted of 1506 million  of ncnr orders 

 5 o ther contractual obligations primarily consisted of 251 million  in indemnityrelated and service related escrows required by certain acquisitions completed in 2005 2010 and 2011 307 million  in campus buildout obligations and other miscellaneous commitments 

guarantees 

we have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a thirdparty we also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance guarantees related to thirdparty customerfinancing arrangements customs and duties guarantees and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities as of december 31 2011  and 2010 we had 199 million  and 216 million  respectively in bank guarantees and standby letters of credit related to these financial guarantees 

liquidity and capital resource requirements   

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future additionally if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under the 2010 stock repurchase program our liquidity may be impacted as of december 31 2011  49 of our cash and investment balances are held outside of the us which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 

in august 2010 we filed a 15 billion shelf registration with the sec in march 2011 we issued notes in the amount of 10 billion under the shelf registration statement therefore while we have no current plans to do so we may issue up to 500 million in additional securities under the shelf registration statement the shelf registration is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions any additional offerings of securities under the shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus 

we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant our intention for fiscal year 2011 was to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at less than three percent 3 of our common stock outstanding based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options rsus and psas counting only the ontarget measure of such psa s we achieved the goal for 2011 we have also managed our equity compensation programs to reduce the overall number of shares subject to outstanding awards over the past two years the total number of common shares subject to our outstanding option rsu and psa awards was 582 million 635 million and 765 million shares as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively reflecting a consecutive decline for the three years ended december 31 2011 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments which includes the proceeds of the issuance of the notes together with cash generated from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next 12 months we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend 

interest rate risk   

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility in addition as of december 31 2011 49 of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held in nonus domiciled countries our marketable securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

  

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 related to the sales of our investments 

  

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december 31 2011 and 2010 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 

  



  



  

these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

  

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts   

  

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of one year or less 

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen approximately 76 of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by nonus dollar denominated operating expense and costs in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue rd sales and marketing and ga expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1 1 and 2 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

if overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the us dollar uniformly changes by 10 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in us dollars would change by less than 1 assuming constant foreign currency cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

  

equity price risk   

  

our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities and our nonqualified deferred compensation “nqdc” plan which may 

also hold publiclytraded equity securities are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates our publiclytraded equity securities are classified as availableforsale securities on our consolidated balance sheets investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet we do not purchase our publiclytraded equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the total investments under the nqdc plan were 93 million  and 81 million respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change on the total investments under the nqdc plan as of december 31 2011 and 2010 would result in an immaterial loss 

we have also invested in privatelyheld companies these investments are carried at cost in 2011 there were impairment charge of 18 million  on our investments in privatelyheld companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in note 5 fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k there were no such charges in 2010 the aggregate cost of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 518 million  and 221 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively

our strategy 

  

our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of highperformance network infrastructure by transforming the experience and economics of networking key elements of our strategy are described below 

  

maintain and extend technology leadership 

  

our junos os applicationspecific integrated circuit “asic” technology and networkoptimized product architecture have been key elements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership we believe that these elements can be leveraged for future products that we are currently developing we intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in research and development “rd” supplemented by external partnerships including strategic alliances and strategic acquisitions that would allow us to deliver a broad range of products and services to customers in target markets 

  

3   

leverage position as supplier of highperformance network infrastructure 

  

from inception we have focused on designing developing and building highperformance network infrastructure for demanding service provider and enterprise networking environments and have integrated purposebuilt technology into a networkoptimized architecture that specifically meets customer needs we believe that many customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors and that the performance reliability and security of our products will provide us with a competitive advantage which is critical to be selected as one of these vendors 

  

be strategic to our customers 

  

in developing our infrastructure and slt solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build bestinclass products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers which has enabled us to design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date we plan to continue to work handinhand with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as to design products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace while enabling customers to reduce costs 

  

enable new ipbased services 

  

our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and secure networks costeffectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products we believe that the secure delivery of ipbased services and applications including web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services outsourced enterprise applications and voiceover ip will continue to grow and benefit from cost efficiencies enabled by our highperformance network infrastructure offerings 

  

establish and develop industry partnerships 

  

our customers have diverse requirements while our products meet certain requirements of our customers our products are not intended to satisfy all of their requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders with diverse technologies and services that extend the value of the network to our customers these partnerships ensure that our customers have access to those technologies and services whether through technology integration joint development resale or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers requirements in addition we believe an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs 

  

markets and customers 

  

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales and through distributors valueadded resellers and original equipment manufacturer “oem” partners to endusers in the following markets 

  

service providers 

  

service providers include wireline wireless and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers we support most major service provider networks in the world and our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance reliability and security that service providers demand we believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our service provider customers by 

  

   

   

   

 4   

rates based on the capabilities of our platforms 

  

while many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline wireless or cable operators in recent years we have seen a move towards convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships we believe these strategic developments are made technically possible as operators invest in the build out of next generation networks capable of supporting voice video and data traffic on to the same ipbased network this convergence relies on ipbased traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multiservice networks and offer service providers significant new revenue opportunities 

  

we believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions these trends include significant growth in ip traffic on service provider networks because of peertopeer interaction broadband usage video an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our ip customers and of their enterprise customers and growth in mobile traffic as a result of the increase mobile device usage including notebooks netbooks smartphones and tablets 

  

the ip infrastructure market for service providers includes products and technology at the network core the network edge to enable access the aggregation layer security to protect from the inside out and the outside in the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs and the management service awareness and control of the entire infrastructure 

  

enterprise 

  

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the worlds most demanding businesses enterprises and public sector organizations such as governments and research and education institutions that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications in addition our solutions 

  

   

   

   

   

as with the service provider market innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market highperformance enterprises require networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance reliability and security with bestinclass open solutions for maximum flexibility we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers branch and campus applications distributed and extended enterprises and wide area network “wan” gateways 

  

as customers increasingly view the network as critical to their success we believe that customers will increasingly demand fast reliable and secure access to services and applications over a single ipbased network this is partly illustrated by the success of our srx services gateways that consolidate switching routing and security services in a single device integrated security gateway “isg” products that combine firewallvirtual private network “vpn” and intrusion detection and prevention “idp” solutions in a single platform and secure services gateway “ssg” platforms that provide a mix of highperformance security with local area network “lan”wan connectivity for regional and branch office deployments we will continue to invest to develop these and other converged technologies and solutions 

  

customers with ten percent of net revenues or greater 

  

verizon communications inc accounted for greater than 10 of our total net revenues in 2010  att inc  accounted for greater than 10 of our total net revenues in 2009  no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our total net revenues in 2008  

  

5   

our products and technology 

  

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created 

  

our infrastructure products are designed to address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless access by combining highperformance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a networkoptimized solution in addition as enterprises continue to develop and rely upon more sophisticated and pervasive internal networks we believe the need for products with highperformance routing and switching technology is expanding to a broader set of customers and we believe our expertise in this technology well positions us to address this growing market opportunity 

  

additionally our slt segment offers a broad family of network security solutions that deliver highperformance costeffective security for enterprises service providers and government entities including integrated firewall and vpn solutions secure sockets layer “ssl” vpn appliances and idp appliances we also offer complementary products and technologies to enable our customers to provide additional ipbased services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and applications 

  

the following is an overview of our major infrastructure and slt product families

junos platform 

  

in addition to our major product families our extended software portfolio known as junos platform is a key technology element in our strategy to be the leader in highperformance networking in february 2010 we announced a new business group called junos ready software dedicated to creating and delivering an ecosystem of software and applications built on the junos platform to solve the most pressing challenges facing customers today the junos platform includes 

  

   

   

7   

the junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers at the heart of the junos platform is junos os we believe junos os is fundamentally superior to other network operating systems in not only its design but also in its development capabilities the advantages of junos os include 

  

   

   

   

junos os is designed to maintain continuous systems and improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades this operational efficiency allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenuegenerating applications helping to advance the economics of highperformance networking 

  

the security and stability of junos os combined with its modular architecture and single source code base provides a foundation for delivering performance reliability security and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments with an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage junos os including routing switching and security products we believe junos os provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors 

  

major product development projects 

  

in 2010 we announced the first solutions from project falcon junipers initiative for providing flexible mobility solutions to service providers that enables them to take advantage of the rapid rise in mobility and mobile applications including video the new solutions including  juniper traffic direct juniper media flow and juniper mobile core evolution  are based on the junos software platform and junipers mx 3d series universal edge routers which deliver what we believe is revolutionary 3d scaling to help networks scale dynamically to support more bandwidth subscribers and services further we expect to extend our leadership in universal edge with the introduction of nonethernet interfaces in our mx series routers additionally we announced a new data center network architecture called the 321 which allows customers to begin the process of simplifying and “flattening” their data centers with an ultimate vision of a single tier data center fabric promised by project stratus which was our initiative to deliver the nextgeneration data center fabric we also announced the junos pulse mobile security suite the industrys most comprehensive solution for securing mobile devices in todays highly connected personal and work environments 

  

customer service 

  

in addition to our infrastructure and slt products we offer support professional and educational services we deliver these services directly to endusers and utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and thirdparty organizations as appropriate 

  

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of support professional and educational services to ensure these services are locally delivered 

  

as of december 31 2010  we employed 1064 people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services 

  

manufacturing and operations 

  

as of december 31 2010  we employed 273 people in manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor and manage product testing and quality 

  

we have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity with celestica flextronics plexus and accton technology our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers in china malaysia mexico the united states and 

8   

taiwan 

  

our contract manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

  

   

   

   

   

our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or endusers generally we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components remain unused or the products remain unsold for specified period we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

  

although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis 

  

our asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources such as international business machines corporation “ibm” each of which is responsible for all aspects of asics production using our proprietary designs 

  

by working collaboratively with our suppliers we have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted and promote the adoption by others of the electronic industry code of conduct “eicc” the eicc outlines standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe workers are treated with respect and dignity and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols software applications and platforms and embedded operating systems as of december 31 2010  we employed 4132 people in our worldwide rd organization 

  

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications integrating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings in our infrastructure and slt products we are leveraging our software asic and systems technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers applications and continuing to develop technology to support the anticipated growth in ip network requirements we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

  

our rd process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our rd team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market expenditures for rd were 9179 million  7417 million  and 7312 million in 2010  2009  and 2008  respectively

sales and marketing 

  

as of december 31 2010  we employed 2466 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

  

our sales organization with its structure of sales professionals system engineers and marketing and channel teams is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers within each team sales team members serve the following three geographic regions i americas including united states canada mexico and central and south america ii europe middle east and africa “emea” and iii asia pacific “apac” within each region there are regional and country teams as well as major account teams to ensure we operate close to our customers 

see note 13 segment information  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning our revenues by geographic regions and by significant customers which is incorporated herein by reference our operations subject us to certain risks and uncertainties associated with international operations see item 1a of part i “risk factors” for more information 

  

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below 

  

in the united states and canada we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers almost all of our sales outside the united states and canada are made through our channel partners 

  

direct sales structure 

  

our sales team engages with customers with which we have direct relationships the terms and conditions of these arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgment of those orders or by purchase contracts the direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

  

channel sales structure 

  

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we do the majority of our sales we employ various channel partners including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

10   

   

in addition to our sales that are direct to customers or that are made entirely through channel partners we have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly with channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a direct relationship with our more strategic enduser customers while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of product through our channel partners 

  

backlog 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2010  and 2009  our total backlog was approximately 330 million and 270 million respectively our backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers generally within the next six months our backlog excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sellthrough to endusers 

  

seasonality 

  

many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first and third quarters in addition our slt segment has generally experienced seasonally strong customer demand in the fourth quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

  

competition 

  

infrastructure business 

  

in the network infrastructure business cisco systems inc cisco has historically been the dominant player in the market however other companies such as alcatellucent brocade communications systems inc brocade extreme networks inc hewlett packard company hp and huawei technologies co ltd huawei are also our principal competitors 

  

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco alcatellucent hp and huawei bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products i n addition consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios for example in 2009 brocade acquired foundry networks inc foundry networks in addition many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively could be leveraged increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share negatively affecting our operating results 

  

slt business 

  

in the market for slt products cisco generally is our primary competitor with its broad range of products in addition there are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines within slt including checkpoint software technologies f5 networks inc and riverbed technology inc these additional competitors tend to be focused on single product line solutions and therefore may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

  

for both product groups we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco alcatellucent and huawei will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products there continues to be consolidation in this industry with smaller companies being acquired by larger established suppliers of network infrastructure products we believe this trend is likely to continue 

11   

  

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

  

environment 

  

we are subject to regulations that have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulations adopted by the european union in addition we participate in the carbon disclosure project “cdp” cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors it hosts one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data in the world at wwwcdprojectnet we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis we believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world 

  

to date compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

in addition we are committed to the environment by our effort in improving the energy efficiency of key elements in our highperformance network product offerings for example our t1600 router consumes substantially less energy than competitive products the environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business 

  

intellectual property 

  

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise 

  

while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

  

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had 8772 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

  

our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

  

factors that may affect future results 

  

investments in our securities involve significant risks the market price of our stock has historically reflected a higher multiple of earnings than many other companies accordingly even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered in the past significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our stock price 

  

our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

  

the factors that may cause our quarterly results to be unpredictable include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in the mix of products and services sold changes in geographies in which our products and services are sold changing market conditions current and potential customer consolidation competition customer concentration long sales and implementation cycles regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending particularly in the first and third quarters 

  

as a result of these risk factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance 

  

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

  

our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have resulted in certain historical periods and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings and could make it difficult to forecast sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses in addition the recent recession and economic weakness particularly in the united states and europe as well as turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions which could lead to reduced demand for our products andor higher costs of production continued economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore the continued weakness and uncertainty in worldwide credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the short and medium term 

  

uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenues from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

  

a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners for example verizon accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 changes in the 

15   

business requirements vendor selection financial prospects capital resources or purchasing behavior of our key customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition in recent years there has been consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example the acquisitions of att inc mci inc and bellsouth corporation if our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or other unforeseen consequences could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we receive product orders late in a quarter we may be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our quarterly revenues 

  

generally our infrastructure products are not stocked by distributors or resellers due to their cost and complexity and configurations required by our customers and we generally build such products as orders are received in recent years the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter has generally continued to increase but remains unpredictable if orders for certain products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to build ship and recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter additionally we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quartertoquarter 

  

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

  

a customers decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

  

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

competition is intense in the markets that we address the infrastructure market has historically been dominated by cisco with competition coming from other companies such as alcatellucent brocade extreme networks hewlett packard company and huawei in the slt market we face intense competition from a broader group of companies such as checkpoint cisco f5 networks and riverbed in addition a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

  

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions in this regard ericsson acquired redback in 2007 and brocade acquired foundry networks in 2009 a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

16   

we rely on valueadded and other resellers distribution partners and oem partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

  

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded and other reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm and nsn the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell our competitors’ products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our valueadded resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues for example in 2006 one of our largest resellers lucent merged with alcatel a competitor of ours as a result of the merger alcatel became a competitor their resale of our products declined and we ultimately terminated our reseller agreement with alcatel our competitors may in some cases be effective in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

  

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

  

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support it and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage for example in 2009 we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with nsn to develop and resell joint carrier ethernet solutions and entered into oem agreements with dell and ibm pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

  

governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues 

  

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring certification notifications review of source code or the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys for example russia and china recently have implemented new requirements relating to products containing encryption and india has imposed special warranty and other obligations associated with technology deemed critical governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in penalties costs and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or government funded projects 

  

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers or other partners as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

  

some of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed for example although it did not adversely affect our shipments an earthquake in late december of 2006 disrupted our communications with china where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs 

17   

  

we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example as we have expanded our contract manufacturing base to china we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturer was not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

  

upgrades to key internal systems and processes and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with and therefore harm our business and operations 

  

we previously initiated a multiyear project to upgrade certain key internal systems and processes including our companywide human resources management system our customer relationship management “crm” system and enterprise resource planning “erp” system in the first quarter of 2010 we implemented a major upgrade of our crm system we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes any disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide service and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner file sec reports in a timely manner or otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more costly than anticipated our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

  

we expect our gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

  

we expect our product gross margins to vary from quartertoquarter and the gross margins we have recently achieved may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including product mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete increases in material or labor costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if we do not accurately forecast product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 

  

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

  

during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited any future growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed for example from time to time including the first quarter of 2008 we experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of product shipments we currently purchase numerous key components including asics from single or limited sources the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

  

18   

if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

  

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all if we fail to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to meet those needs in a timely manner it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance 

  

for example in 2010 in connection with the acquisitions of altor and trapeze we are now offering a wlan product and a virtualization security product additionally in 2009 we announced plans to develop and introduce new data center products with our project stratus and mobility solutions with our project falcon if these or other new products do not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected in addition if we fail to achieve market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets and aspirations may be adversely affected in addition if we fail to deliver new or announced products to the market in a timely manner it could adversely affect the market acceptance of those products and harm our competitive position and our business and financial results 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws applicable to us transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement tax effects of sharebased compensation costs related to intercompany restructurings or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

for example in 2009 we received a proposed adjustment from the irs claiming that we owe additional taxes plus interest and possible penalties for the 2004 tax year based on a transfer pricing transaction related to the license of acquired intangibles under an intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement as a result of the proposed adjustment the incremental tax liability would be approximately 807 million excluding interest and penalties we believe the irs’ position with regard to this matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations and that our previously reported income tax provision for the year in question is appropriate however there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor regardless of whether this matter is resolved in our favor the final resolution of this matter could be expensive and timeconsuming to defend andor settle while we believe we have provided adequately for this matter there is a possibility that an adverse outcome of the matter could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

telecommunications companies and our other large customers generally require more onerous terms and conditions in our contracts with them as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

  

telecommunications service provider companies and other large companies because of their size generally have greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions from us as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

  

for example customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result this class of 

19   

customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

  

we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers and the manufacturers order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts if we overestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time if we underestimate our requirements as we did in the third quarter of 2010 with respect to certain components our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products which could increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues 

  

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

  

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in other countries each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

  

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business for example in december 2010 we acquired altor and trapeze in july 2010 we acquired smobile and in april 2010 we acquired ankeena acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of managements attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders assume liabilities record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition if we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is 

20   

intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

  

we are a party to lawsuits which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay damages or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits we have been served with lawsuits related to patent infringement as well as securities laws a description of which can be found in note 15 commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” there can be no assurance that these or any actions that have been or may be brought against us our officers and our directors will be resolved favorably or that tentative settlements will become final regardless of whether they are resolved these lawsuits are and any future lawsuits to which we our officers or our directors may become a party will likely be expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve such costs of defense as well as any losses resulting from these claims or settlement of these claims could significantly increase our expenses and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

litigation or claims regarding intellectual property rights may be time  consuming expensive and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

  

third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers partners or customers alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies or enter into license agreements furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions 

  

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions in periods of market expansion we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in rd sales and marketing and other parts of our business as we have in the year ended december 31 2010 conversely during 2009 in response to downward trending industry and market conditions we restructured our business rebalanced our workforce and reduced our real estate portfolio many of our expenses such as real estate expenses cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted because of fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees moreover rapid changes in the size of our workforce could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 

  

regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects 

  

the traditional telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the internet telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service or content providers regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or content providers could adversely affect those customers needs for products designed to enable a wide range of such services or business models for instance the us federal communications commission has issued regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks these regulations might impact service provider and content provider business models and as such 

21   

providers needs for internet telecommunications equipment and services 

  

in addition environmental regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations may impact our business and financial condition adversely for instance the european union has adopted weee rohs and reach regulations in addition some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria even though those criteria may be in conflict with accepted international standards similar regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business the adoption and implementation of such regulations could decrease demand for our products increase the cost of building and selling our products and impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

a breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products which could cause us to lose revenues 

  

if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our security products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques this could cause us to lose current and potential endcustomers or cause us to lose current and potential valueadded resellers and distributors 

  

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states in addition a portion of our rd and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the united states 

  

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including changes in general it spending the imposition of government controls changes or limitations in trade protection laws other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws natural disasters epidemic disease labor unrest earnings expatriation restrictions misappropriation of intellectual property military actions acts of terrorism political and social unrest and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations in particular in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures which are designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and policies  violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro indian rupee and japanese yen related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars and a weakened us dollar could 

22   

increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

  

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities however no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances including longterm declines in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

  

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

  

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

  

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow then our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the build out of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when the customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors our business could be adversely affected and we may need to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

  

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers any errors defects or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and reputation and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition in the event an error defect or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention in addition if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

  

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may 

23   

need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

  

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

  

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the failure to comply with the terms of any license may result in our inability to continue to use such license our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us if possible to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

  

we are required to test annually and review on an interim basis our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any future acquisitions to determine if impairment has occurred as of december 31 2010 our goodwill was 39278 million if such assets are deemed impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized this would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred for example such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock falls below certain levels for a sustained period or if the portions of our business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at expected rates or decline in the second quarter of 2006 our impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of 12800 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our balance sheet for the slt operating segment primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately nine months prior to the impairment review and to a lesser extent a decrease in forecasted future cash flows in recent years economic weakness contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours future declines in our stock price as well as any marked decline in our level of revenues or gross margins increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets 

  

while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 

  

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions may be adversely affected if our financial statements are not reliable and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

  

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

  

at december 31 2010 we had 18119 million in cash and cash equivalents and 10097 million in short and longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in us government securities governmentsponsored enterprise obligations foreign government debt securities corporate notes and bonds commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by us subprime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and 

24   

caused credit and liquidity issues at many financial institutions these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

  

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

  

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

this annual report on form 10k “report” including the “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” contains forwardlooking statements regarding future events and the future results of juniper networks inc we us or the “company” that are based on our current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about our business our results of operations the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management words such as “expects” “anticipates” “targets” “goals” “projects” “would” “could” “intends” “plans” “believes” “seeks” “estimates” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed in this report under the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i and elsewhere and in other reports we file with the sec specifically our most recent reports on form 10q while forwardlooking statements are based on reasonable expectations of our management at the time that they are made you should not rely on them we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forwardlooking statements for any reason 

  

the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” in the course of operating our business we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices the collection of receivables the manufacturing and shipment of products the fulfillment of orders the purchase of supplies and the building of inventory and spare parts among other matters each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period in making these decisions we consider various factors including contractual obligations customer satisfaction competition internal and external financial targets and expectations and financial planning objectives the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges assumptions used in the valuation of sharebased compensation and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 1 of part i of this annual report on form 10k and our “critical accounting policies and estimates” section included in this “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

executive overview 

  

in 2010 we experienced a yearoveryear increase in net revenues across all regions and in both the enterprise and service provider markets these increases reflect growing market demand for networking and security products as our customers expand their networks and the recovering global economy additionally while our net revenues grew we continued to control costs as we invested in our innovation and customer satisfaction initiatives 

  

the following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended december 31 2010  and 2009 in millions except per share amounts and percentages 

  



  

   

   

   

   

   

business and market environment 

  

we design develop and sell products and services that together provide our customers with highperformance network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single network we serve the highperformance networking requirements of global service providers enterprises governments and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success highperformance networking is designed to provide fast reliable and secure access to applications and services at scale we offer a highperformance network infrastructure that includes ip routing ethernet switching security software and application acceleration solutions as well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer investments 

30

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the 

31   

preparation of the consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 

  

• revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

  

   

   

   

   

we adopted accounting standards update “asu” no 200913 topic 605  multipledeliverable revenue arrangements “asu 200913” and asu no 200914 topic 985  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements “asu 200914” on a prospective basis as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 for new and materially modified arrangements originating after december 31 2009 under the new standards we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based on the relative selling price of each element arrangement consideration allocated to undelivered elements is deferred until delivery 

for fiscal 2010 and future periods pursuant to the guidance of asu 200913 when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements and software and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price “esp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 

vsoe is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends for specific products and services tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers however as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and our solutions offer substantially different features and functionality the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained additionally as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products selling prices are on a standalone basis we are not typically able to determine tpe when determining the best estimate of selling price we apply management judgment by considering multiple factors including but not limited to pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels gross margin objectives internal costs competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles 

for transactions initiated prior to january 1 2010 revenue for arrangements with multiple elements such as sales of products that include services is allocated to each element using the residual method based on the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered items pursuant to asc topic 985605  software  revenue recognition  under the residual method the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element in which case the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period 

as a result of the adoption of asu 200913 and asu 200914 net revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 was approximately 237 million higher than the net revenue that would have been recorded under the previous 

32   

accounting rules the increase in revenue was due to recognition of revenue for products shipped during the period which included approximately 183 million in the year ended december 31 2010 related to undelivered product commitments for which we were unable to demonstrate fair value pursuant to the previous accounting standards the remainder of the increase in revenue for the year was due to products sold into multipleyear service arrangements which was recognized ratably under the previous accounting standards and for the change in our allocation methodology from the residual method to the relative selling price method as prescribed by asu 200913 

we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary depending on the nature and volume of new or materially modified arrangements in any given period as well as on changes in our business practices however as asu 200913 and asu 200914 would allow us to recognize revenue for the portion allocated to delivered items in multiple element arrangements and defer revenue for only the portion allocated to the undelivered items we expect that the magnitude of deferrals related to undelivered product commitments and other items for which we previously would not have been able to establish vsoe will gradually decrease over time 

we account for multiple agreements with a single customer as one arrangement if the contractual terms andor substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are in effect parts of a single arrangement our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value in addition our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers 

  

for sales to direct endusers valueadded resellers and original equipment manufacturers oem partners we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment it is our practice to identify an enduser prior to shipment to a valueadded reseller for our endusers and valueadded resellers there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits our agreements with oem partners may allow future rights of returns additionally a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return we recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sellthrough as reported to us by the distributors deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sellthrough deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue 

  

we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments such as rebates and price protection in the same period that the related revenue is recorded managements judgment with respect to the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits specific criteria included in rebate agreements and other factors known at the time should actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our estimates additional reductions to revenue may be required in addition we report revenue net of sales taxes 

  

service revenues include revenue from maintenance training and professional services maintenance is offered under renewable contracts revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period which is generally one year or less 

  

we sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis as part of a customer financing arrangement primarily with one major financing company we record cash received under this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition as shortterm debt 

  

 33   

usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors outside of our control we may incur charges for excess components which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 

  

   

   

we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of november 1 st or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying value including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income and the market approaches under the income approach we calculate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill when the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

  

intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate and the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value we assess the recoverability of our intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances are greater than the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets the amount of impairment if any is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows 

  

the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business if our actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets we could incur additional impairment charges 

  

   

we utilize the blackscholesmerton “bsm” optionpricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected option life and riskfree interest rate the expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options the expected life of an award is 

34   

based on historical experience the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees and the potential effect from options that have not been exercised we determine the fair value of rsus and psas based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date in addition we estimate sharebased compensation expense for our psas based on the vesting criteria and only recognize expense for the portions in which annual targets have been set 

  

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent managements best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our sharebased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expectedtovest shares if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate our recorded sharebased compensation expense could be different 

  

   

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

  

significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions under asc topic 740 and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves under asc topic 740 are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made as it was during the first quarter of 2010 when we recorded a nonrecurring income tax benefit as a result of a taxpayer favorable federal appellate court ruling in xilinx inc v commissioner  the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves under asc topic 740 and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties if applicable 

  

   

from time to time we are involved in disputes litigation and other legal actions we are aggressively defending our 

35   

current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other thirdparty claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation andor substantial settlement charges in addition the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods if any of those events were to occur our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses for a discussion of current litigation please see under the heading legal proceedings in note 15 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k

in 2010 infrastructure products revenue experienced growth in the enterprise and service provider markets across all regions compared to 2009 this increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our mx series routers and ex series switches the increased demand for our products was primarily due to growing network demand attributable to increased reliance on digital devices connected to the network and to a lesser extent the improved macroeconomic environment 

  

infrastructure product revenues decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased revenue from m t and e series product families attributable to our customers reduced demand as a result of the global economic environment partially offset by revenue growth from our ex series switching products and mx series products we experienced a decrease in product revenue from the service provider market in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased capital spending in that market we experienced an increase in product revenue from the enterprise market in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the growth in our ex series switching business and our continued focus on selling infrastructure products into the enterprise market which resulted in growth of enterprise revenues in americas and apac geographically infrastructure product revenue decreased in all three regions in 2009 

  

we track infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth most of our infrastructure product platforms are modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform each modular chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces the modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period the following table presents infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped 

  



  

   

infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2010 compared to 2009  which was commensurate with infrastructure product revenue growth during the year infrastructure port shipments increased in 2010 compared to 2009  primarily due to the continued growth in sales of mx series products which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis 

  

37   

infrastructure chassis revenue units decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to reduced customer demand because of the weakened global economy the port shipments increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in the mx series products which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis 

  

infrastructure  service 

  

a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers that purchase our products and enter into support services contracts for support infrastructure service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 which was primarily driven by increased revenue from new product sales and strong contract renewals for support services from a geographical and market perspective the increase in infrastructure service revenues was primarily due to an increase in enterprise business across all regions and service provider business in the emea and apac regions these increases were partially offset by a decrease in service revenue in the americas service provider market 

  

infrastructure service revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment being serviced and support services renewals from a geographical and market perspective the increase in infrastructure service revenues was primarily due to an increase in the enterprise and service provider business across all regions during the year ended december 31 2009

cost of revenues and gross margin 

  

the following table presents cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margins in millions except percentages 

  



  

   

most of our manufacturing repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers accordingly most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for standard product costs the cost of product revenues increased in absolute dollars in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in product volume product gross margin and product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in 2010 compared to 2009 increased primarily due to a change in product mix that favored higher margin products and our continued efforts to manage costs as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had 273 and 244 employees respectively in our manufacturing and operations organization that primarily manage relationships with our independent contract manufacturers manage our supply chain orchestrate new product introductions and monitor and manage product testing and quality 

  

the cost of product revenues and product gross margin decreased in absolute dollars in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower revenue level the decrease in product gross margin as a percentage of revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to product mix that favored products with lower gross margin such as our switching and mx series products geographical mix and pricing 

  

the cost of service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increased headcount and outside services to support our customer needs and variable compensation support professional and educational services also referred to as “servicerelated” headcount increased by 19 to 1064 employees as of december 31 2010 compared to 891 employees as of december 31 2009 total personnelrelated costs as a percentage of service revenues were relatively flat in 2010 as we continued to manage costs while growing our revenues information technology “it” expenses related to cost of service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 which is commensurate with the increase in headcount service gross margin increased in absolute dollars primarily due to increased service revenues and service gross margin as a percentage of service revenues decreased primarily due to a shift in mix that was driven by an increase in valueadded service related revenue 

  

t he cost of service revenues and service gross margin increased in 2009 compared to 2008 the increase in cost of service revenues was attributable to increased headcount and increased spending on servicerelated spares service gross margin increased primarily due to our continued efforts to manage costs servicerelated headcount increased by 108 employees or 14 to 891 employees in 2009 compared to 783 in 2008 total personnelrelated costs as a percentage of service revenues were approximately 18 for 2009 and 20 for 2008 the decrease in personnelrelated costs in 2009 as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due to the overall increase in service revenues our outside service expense also increased in 2009 

41   

primarily to support the expanding installed equipment base additionally facilities and it expenses related to cost of service revenues increased in connection with the growth of service business as a portion of our overall operations 

  

the decrease in cost of service revenues and operating expenses including rd sales and marketing and ga expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1 2 and 1 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

facility and it departmental costs are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expense based on usage and headcount respectively such costs increased by 201 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in departmental headcount the continued buildout of our domestic and international development and test centers and it applications to support our internal operations facility and it related headcount was 388  294  and 267 as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in 2011 we expect to continue to invest in our companywide it infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives

the 2010 sharebased compensation expense includes the value of vested restricted shares paid to certain former ankeena employees refer to note 5 cash cash equivalents and investments under the heading  restricted cash in notes to consolidated in financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

  

sharebased compensation expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in rsu and psa grants during the period primarily resulting from an increase in the number of participants the increase in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily relates to new stock option grants particularly in late 2008 

  

interest and other income net gain loss on equity investments and income tax provision 

  

the following table presents interest and other income net gain loss on equity investments and income tax provision in millions except percentages 

  



  

net interest and other income decreased in 2010 compared to 2009  and in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower 

44   

interest rates and an increase in customer financing charges during 2010 

  

in 2010 we recognized a total gain of 87 million primarily due to acquisitions of our privatelyheld equity investments in ankeena and altor there were no impairment charges related to our equity investments in the year ended december 31 2010  during 2009 and 2008  we recognized impairment losses of 55 million and 148 million respectively on our equity investments for changes in fair value that we believed were otherthantemporary 

  

our effective tax rates were 204 631 and 298 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in overall rate in 2010 compared to 2009 and the federal statutory rate of 35 was primarily due to a 541 million income tax benefit recorded during the companys first quarter resulting from a change in the companys estimate of unrecognized tax benefits due to the taxpayer favorable ruling by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit the “court” in xilinx inc v commissioner related to sharebased compensation the federal rd credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates 

  

the increase in the overall rate in 2009 compared to 2008 and the federal statutory rate of 35 was primarily due to the following income tax charges i a 618 million discrete and other related charge that resulted from changes in california income tax laws that were enacted during 2009 ii a 521 million charge that resulted from a change in our unrecognized tax benefits related to sharebased compensation  and iii a 46 million charge which related to an investigation by the india tax authorities the effective rate impact from these charges was partially offset by the federal rd credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates 

  

the 2008 effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35 primary due to the federal rd credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates

infrastructure segment 

  

an analysis of the change in revenues for the infrastructure segment and the change in revenue units can be found above in the section titled “infrastructure segment revenues” 

  

infrastructure operating income increased as a percent of infrastructure revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a higher gross margin percentage which was attributable to changes in product mix that favored higher margin products additionally although infrastructure sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers they decreased as a percentage of infrastructure revenues 

infrastructure segment operating income as a percent of revenue decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage that was driven by changes in product mix and to a lesser extent pricing additionally rd expenses increased as a percentage of infrastructure revenue in 2009 as we continued to make investments to expand our product features and functionality and sales and marketing expenses increased slightly as a percentage of infrastructure revenue as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers 

slt segment 

  

an analysis of the change in revenues for the slt segment and the change in units can be found above in the section titled “slt segment revenues” 

  

slt operating income increased as a percent of revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percent of slt revenue as we continued our efforts to carefully manage costs additionally the increase was attributable to higher gross margin percentage resulting from changes in product mix and efficiencies achieved from the higher 

46   

2010 revenues 

  

slt operating income increased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower rd and other operating expenses as a percent of slt revenue from reductions in discretionary spending as a part of our cost control initiatives and higher gross margin percentage from changes in product mix 

  

key performance measures

2 booktobill ratio represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows contractual obligations and our stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

historically we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and to a lesser extent the issuance of our common stock the following table shows our capital resources in millions except percentages 



  

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and short term investments reduced by deferred revenue accrued liabilities and accounts payable the increase in working capital from december 31 2009  to december 31 2010  is primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents higher accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments at the end of the period higher prepaid income taxes partially offset by a decrease in accrued litigation settlements 

  

stock repurchase activities 

  

in february 2010 the board of directors the “board” approved a new stock repurchase program the “2010 stock repurchase program” under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 10 billion of our common stock this new authorization is in addition to the stock repurchase program approved by the board in march 2008 the “2008 stock repurchase program” under which we were also authorized to repurchase up to 10 billion of our common stock 

  

under the two stock repurchase programs we repurchased approximately 197 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 2867 per share for a total purchase price of 5635 million in the year ended december 31 2010  and approximately 207 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 2191 per share for a total purchase price of 4535 million in the year ended december 31 2009  as of december 31 2010  there were no remaining authorized funds under the 2008 stock repurchase program and 7551 million remaining authorized funds under the 2010 stock repurchase program 

  

47   

in addition to repurchases under our stock repurchase programs we also had brokertransacted repurchases of common stock from our employees in connection with net issuance of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations for the vesting of certain rsus and psas the repurchases were for approximately 01 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 2575 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 19 million in connection with the net issuances during the year ended december 31 2010  there was an immaterial amount of brokertransacted repurchases of common stock from our employees in connection with net issuance of shares during year ended december 31 2009  

  

all shares of common stock repurchased under the 2008 and 2010 stock repurchase programs and from our employees in connection with net issuances have been retired future share repurchases under the 2010 stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements this program may be discontinued at any time see note 18 subsequent events  for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2011 

  

summary of cash flows 

  

in the year ended december 31 2010  cash and cash equivalents increased by 2072 million  this increase was the result of cash generated from our operating activities of 8123 million  partially offset by cash used in our investing and financing activities of 5328 million and 724 million  respectively 

  

operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 8123 million  7961 million  and 8752 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase of 162 million from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher net income partially offset by litigation settlement payments prepaid taxes and higher accounts receivable operating cash flow decreased by 791 million from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower net income partially offset by increase in other accrued liabilities due to the litigation settlement reached in the fourth quarter of 2009 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 5328 million  9483 million  and 1498 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the change between periods was primarily due to the movement of cash between cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments due to our investment strategy the change from 2009 to 2010 was further impacted by net cash paid for acquisitions in 2010 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 724 million  2622 million  and 4224 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the change between periods was due to an increase in cash used to repurchase our common stock through our stock repurchase programs which was partially offset by greater cash proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees for each period as the result of the higher stock prices 

  

48   

deferred revenue 

  

the following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues in millions 

  



  

deferred gross product revenue as of december 31 2010 increased 462 million compared to december 31 2009 primarily due to an increase in undelivered product commitments and other product deferrals total deferred service revenue increased 834 million compared to december 31 2009 largely due to higher sales of service contracts and multiyear service billings 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2010  and 2009  

  

contractual obligations 

  

our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments tax liabilities and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2010  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 



 

1 our contractual obligations under operating leases primarily relate to our leased facilities under our noncancelable operating leases rent payments are allocated to costs and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we occupy approximately 22 million square feet worldwide under operating leases the majority of our office space is in north america including our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale california our longest lease expires on november 22 2022  

2 in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply our contract manufacturers place noncancelable nonreturnable “ncnr” orders for components based on our build forecasts the contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts and on purchase orders we have received from our customers generally we do not own the components and title to the product transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders as of december 31 2010  we had accrued 227 million based on our estimate of such charges total purchase commitments as of december 31 2010  consisted of 1986 million of ncnr orders 

3 tax liabilities include 1039 million of longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 

4 other contractual obligations consists of 650 million of indemnityrelated and servicerelated escrows required by certain acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2010 132 million remaining balance for a data center hosting agreement that requires payments through the end of april 2013 92 million for license and service agreements and 77 million under a software subscription agreement that requires payments through the end of january 2011 

  

49   

guarantees 

  

we have entered into agreements with some of our customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include guarantees of product and service performance standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and guarantees related to thirdparty customer financing arrangements as of december 31 2010  we had 216 million in guarantees and standby letters of credit as of december 31 2009  we had 340 million in guarantees and standby letters of credit 

  

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

  

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the future additionally if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs our liquidity may be impacted as of december 31 2010  over 60 of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the us which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 

  

in august 2010 we filed a 15 billion shelf registration with the sec the filing replaced our prior 10 billion shelf registration which had expired the shelf registration is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions any offerings of securities will be made pursuant to a prospectus 

  

we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant our intention for fiscal year 2010 was and fiscal year 2011 is to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at approximately three percent 3 of our common stock outstanding based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options rsus and psas counting only the ontarget measure of such psas we achieved that goal with respect to 2010 and we believe we are on track with respect to this goal for 2011 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next 12 months we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility in addition as of december 31 2010  over 60 of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held in nonus domiciled countries our marketable securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

  

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december 31 2010  2009  and 2008  related to the sales of our investments 

  

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december 31 2010  and 2009  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 

  



  



  

these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

  

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

  

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

  

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of approximately two months  

  

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating 

52   

expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to cost of service revenue and operating expenses these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2010  2009  and 2008  respectively in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue rd sales and marketing and ga expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1 2 and 1 in 2010  2009  and 2008  respectively 

  

equity price risk 

  

our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities and our nonqualified deferred compensation “nqdc” plan which may also hold publiclytraded equity securities are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates our publiclytraded equity securities are classified as availableforsale securities on our consolidated balance sheets investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet we do not purchase our publiclytraded equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes as of december 31 2010 we no longer have any investments in publiclytraded equity securities the aggregate fair value of our publiclytraded equity securities as of december 31 2009 was 54 million as of december 31 2010  and 2009  the total investments under the nqdc plan were 81 million and 47 million  respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change on the total investments under the nqdc plan as of december 31 2010 and 2009 would result in an immaterial loss 

  

we monitor our portfolio publiclytraded equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis in the event that the carrying value of a publictraded equity investment exceeds its fair value and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value there were no impairment charges in 2010 and 2009 to our portfolio of publiclytraded equity investments and in 2008 we realized an impairment charge of 35 million 

  

in addition to publiclytraded equity securities we have also invested in privatelyheld companies these investments are carried at cost in 2009 we realized an impairment charge of 55 million on our investments in privatelyheld companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in note 6 fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k there were no such charges in 2010  the aggregate cost of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 221 million and 139 million as of december 31 2010  and 2009  respectively

our strategy 

 

our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of highperformance network infrastructure by transforming the experience and economics of networking key elements of our strategy are described below 

 

maintain and extend technology leadership 

 

our junos os applicationspecific integrated circuit “asic” technology and networkoptimized product architecture have been key elements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership we believe that these elements can be leveraged into future products that we are currently developing we intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in research and development “rd” supplemented by external partnerships including strategic alliances that would allow us to deliver a broad range of products and services to customers in target markets 

leverage position as supplier of highperformance network infrastructure 

 

from inception we have focused on designing developing and building highperformance network infrastructure for demanding service provider and enterprise networking environments and have integrated purposebuilt technology into a networkoptimized architecture that specifically meets our customers’ needs we believe that many of these customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors we believe that the performance reliability and security of our products provide us with a competitive advantage which is critical in gaining selection as one of these vendors 

 

be strategic to our customers 

 

in developing our infrastructure and slt solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build bestinclass products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers that increased understanding has enabled us subsequently to design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date we plan to continue to work handinhand with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as to design future products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace while enabling customers to reduce costs 

 

enable new ipbased services 

 

our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and secure networks costeffectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products we believe that the secure delivery of ipbased services and applications web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services outsourced enterprise applications and voiceover ip will continue to grow and are costeffectively enabled by our highperformance network infrastructure offerings 

 

establish and develop industry partnerships 

 

our customers have diverse requirements while our products meet certain requirements of our customers our products are not intended to satisfy certain other requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders in a diverse set of technologies and services that extend the value of the network for our customers these partnerships ensure that we have access to those technologies and services whether through technology integration joint development resale or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers’ requirements in addition we believe in an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation and provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs 

 

markets and customers 

 

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales and through distributors valueadded resellers and original equipment manufacturer “oem” partners to endusers in the following markets 

 

service providers 

 

service providers include wireline wireless and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers supporting most major service provider networks in the world our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance reliability and security that service providers demand our networking infrastructure offerings benefit these customers by 

 

 4 

 

  

while many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline wireless or cable operators in recent years we have seen a move towards convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships we believe these strategic developments are made technically possible as operators invest in the build out of next generation networks capable of supporting voice video and data traffic on to the same ipbased network this convergence relies on ipbased traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multiservice networks and offer service providers significant new revenue opportunities 

 

we believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions these trends include significant growth in ip traffic on service provider networks because of peertopeer interaction broadband usage video and an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our ip customers and of their enterprise customers 

 

the ip infrastructure market for service providers includes products and technology at the network core the network edge to enable access the aggregation layer security to protect from the inside out and the outside in the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs and the management service awareness and control of the entire infrastructure 

 

enterprise 

 

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the world’s most demanding businesses for this reason enterprises and public sector organizations such as governments and research and education institutions that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications while 

 

  

as with the service provider market innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market we believe that innovative enterprises view the network as critical to their success and therefore must build advanced network infrastructures that provide fast reliable and secure access to services and applications over a single ipbased network these highperformance enterprises require networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors need to demonstrate performance reliability and security to these customers in specific segments with bestinclass open solutions for maximum flexibility we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers branch and campus applications distributed and extended enterprises and wide area network “wan” gateways 

 

as customers increasingly view the network as critical to their success we believe that customers will increasingly demand fast reliable and secure access to services and applications over a single ipbased network this is partly illustrated by the success of our srx services gateways that consolidate switching routing and security services in a single device integrated security gateway “isg” products that combine firewallvirtual private network “vpn” and intrusion detection and prevention “idp” solutions in a single platform and secure services gateway “ssg” platforms that provide a mix of highperformance security with local area network “lan”wan connectivity for regional and branch office deployments we will continue to invest to develop these and other converged technologies and solutions 

customers with ten percent of net revenues or greater 

 

att inc accounted for greater than 10 of our total net revenues in 2009 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our total net revenues in 2008 nokiasiemens networks bv “nsn” accounted for greater than 10 of our total net revenues in 2007 

 

our products and technology 

 

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created our infrastructure products are designed to address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless access by combining highperformance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a networkoptimized solution in addition as enterprises continue to develop and rely upon more sophisticated and pervasive internal networks we believe the need for products with highperformance routing and switching technology is expanding to a broader set of customers and we believe our expertise in this technology uniquely positions us to address this growing market opportunity 

 

additionally our slt segment offers a broad family of network security solutions that deliver highperformance costeffective security for enterprises service providers and government entities including integrated firewall and vpn solutions secure sockets layer “ssl” vpn appliances and idp appliances we also offer complementary products and technologies to enable our customers to provide additional ipbased services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and applications 

 

the following is an overview of our major infrastructure and slt product families

see item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this annual report on form 10k for an analysis of net product revenues by segment 

 

junos platform 

 

in addition to our major product families our extended software portfolio known as junos platform is a key technology element in our strategy to be the leader in highperformance networking the junos platform includes the junos space network application platform and junos pulse integrated multiservice network client which have been built with the same core design principles integration approach and development discipline the junos platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space deploy software clients to control delivery and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers 

 

at the heart of the junos platform is junos os we believe junos os is fundamentally superior to other network operating systems in not only its design but also in its development the advantages of junos os include 

 

  

junos os is designed to maintain continuous systems and improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos os helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades this operational efficiency allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenuegenerating applications helping to advance the economics of highperformance networking 

the security and stability of junos os combined with its modular architecture and single source code base provides a foundation for delivering performance reliability security and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments with an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage junos os including routing switching and security products we believe junos os provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors 

 

major product development projects 

 

in 2009 we announced two significant product development efforts project stratus and project falcon project stratus is our initiative to develop a single data center fabric designed to significantly advance scale performance and simplicity while lowering energy consumption and reducing overall operating costs compared to currently existing data center solutions project falcon is an effort to develop mobility solutions for service provider customers based on our mx 3d series universal edge routers and the junos software platform 

 

customer service and support 

 

in addition to our infrastructure and slt products we offer the following services 24x7x365 technical assistance hardware repair and replacement parts unspecified software updates on a whenandifavailable basis professional services and educational services we deliver these services directly to endusers and utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and thirdparty organizations as appropriate 

 

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of education and support services to ensure locally delivered training 

 

as of december 31 2009 we employed 891 people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services 

 

manufacturing and operations 

 

as of december 31 2009 we employed 244 people in manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor and manage product testing and quality 

 

we have manufacturing relationships primarily with celestica flextronics and plexus under which we have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity our manufacturing activity is primarily conducted in china malaysia mexico and the united states 

 

this subcontracting activity in all locations extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

  

our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or endusers generally we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components remain unused or the products remain unsold for specified period we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material 

charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

 

although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis 

 

our asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources such as international business machines “ibm” corporation each of which is responsible for all aspects of the production of the asics using our proprietary designs 

 

we have five core values trust respect humility integrity and excellence these values are integral to how we manage our company and interact with our employees customers partners and suppliers by working collaboratively with our suppliers we also have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted and promote the adoption by others of the electronic industry code of conduct “eicc” the eicc outlines standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible 

 

research and development 

 

as of december 31 2009 we employed 3308 people in our worldwide rd organization we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols and embedded operating systems these individuals have worked in leading computer data networking and telecommunication companies 

 

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings in our infrastructure and slt products we are leveraging our software and asic technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers’ applications and continuing to develop technology to support the anticipated growth in ip network requirements we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

 

our rd process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our rd team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market 

 

sales and marketing 

 

as of december 31 2009 we employed 2101 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization these sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

 

our sales organization is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers with each separate team ensuring focus on key customers in these respective markets from a geographic perspective the organization is grouped into three geographic regions which are i the americas including united states canada mexico central and south america ii europe middle east and africa “emea” and iii asia pacific “apac” within each region there are regional and country teams as well as major account teams to ensure we operate close to our customers there is a structure of sales professionals system engineers and marketing and channel teams each focused on the respective service provider and enterprise markets 

see note 11 segment information  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning our revenues by geographic regions and by significant customers which is incorporated herein by reference our operations subject us to certain risks and uncertainties associated with international operations see item 1a of part i “risk factors” for more information 

 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below 

 

in the united states and canada we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers almost all of our sales outside the united states and canada are made through our channel partners 

 

direct sales structure 

 

where we have a direct relationship with our customers the terms and conditions are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgement of those orders or by purchase contracts in instances where we have direct contracts with our customers those contracts set forth only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products for this type of customer our sales team engages directly with the customer we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

 

channel sales structure 

 

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we do the majority of our business we employ various channel partners including but not limited to 

 

  

within each region we employ sales professionals to assist with the management of our various sales channels in addition we have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly with the channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a direct relationship with our more strategic enduser customers while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of product through our channel partners 

backlog 

 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers at any given time we have backlog orders for products that have not been shipped because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results as of december 31 2009 and 2008 our total backlog orders was approximately 270 million and 250 million respectively our backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers generally within six months our backlog excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sellthrough to endusers 

 

seasonality 

 

many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first and third quarters in addition our slt segment has experienced seasonally strong customer demand in the fourth quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

 

competition 

 

infrastructure business 

 

in the network infrastructure business cisco systems has historically been the dominant player in the market however other companies such as alcatellucent brocade communications systems inc ericsson extreme networks inc hewlett packard company and huawei technologies co ltd are providing competitive products in the marketplace 

 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco alcatellucent and huawei have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressure faced by us for example in 2007 ericsson acquired redback networks and in 2009 brocade acquired foundry networks in addition many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could seriously harm our operating results 

 

slt business 

 

in the market for slt products cisco generally is our primary competitor with its broad range of products in addition there are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines within slt including checkpoint software technologies fortinet inc f5 networks inc and riverbed technology inc these additional competitors tend to be focused on single product line solutions and therefore are generally specialized as competitors to our products in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

 

for both product groups we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco alcatellucent and huawei will introduce new products which are designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products consolidation in this industry has begun with one or more of these companies being acquired by large established suppliers of network infrastructure products and we believe it is likely to continue 

 

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our 

products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

 

environment 

 

we are subject to regulations that have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulations adopted by the european union in addition we participate in the carbon disclosure project “cdp” cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors it hosts one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data in the world at wwwcdprojectnet we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis we believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world 

 

compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

 

in addition we are committed to the environment by our effort in improving the energy efficiency of key elements of our highperformance network product offerings for example our t1600 router consumes substantially less energy than competitive products the environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business 

 

intellectual property 

 

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise 

 

while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

 

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed or that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had 7231 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

 

our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any 

defined period of time the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future

factors that may affect future results 

 

investments in equity securities of publiclytraded companies involve significant risks the market price of our stock has historically reflected a higher multiple of expected future earnings than many other companies accordingly even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our stock price 

 

our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quartertoquarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

 

the factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in the mix of products sold changes in geographies in which our products are sold changing market conditions including current and potential customer consolidation competition customer concentration long sales and implementation cycles regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first and third quarters 

 

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance 

 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

 

our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network 

expansion have recently resulted and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings and could negatively impact our ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer relationships in addition recent turmoil in the global financial markets and associated economic weakness or recession particularly in the united states and europe as well as turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions which could lead to continued reduced demand for our products andor higher costs of production the current economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in customer bad debt restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore the recent disruption in worldwide credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed in the shortterm uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenues from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

 

a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners for example att inc accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues in fiscal year 2009 this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results changes in the business requirements vendor selection or purchasing behavior of our key customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers in addition the recession’s impact on worldwide credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition in recent years there has been consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example the acquisitions of att inc mci inc and bellsouth corporation and consolidation among the large vendors of telecommunications equipment and services for example the acquisition of redback by ericsson the joint venture of nsn and the acquisition of foundry networks by brocade such consolidation may cause our customers who are involved in these transactions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or have other unforeseen consequences that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we receive infrastructure product orders late in a quarter we may be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our quarterly revenues 

 

generally our infrastructure products are not stocked by distributors or resellers due to their cost and complexity and configurations required by our customers and we generally build such products as orders are received if orders for these products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to build ship and recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter 

 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial results 

 

competition is intense in the markets that we address the infrastructure market has historically been dominated by cisco with other companies such as alcatellucent brocade ericsson extreme networks hewlettpackard company and huawei providing products to a smaller segment of the market in addition a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

 

in the slt market we face intense competition from a broader group of companies such as checkpoint cisco fortinet f5 networks and riverbed in addition a number of other small public and private companies have 

products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners andor resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us in this regard ericsson acquired redback in 2007 and brocade acquired foundry networks in 2009 a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we rely on valueadded resellers distribution and original equipment manufacturer partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded reseller and distribution partners including our worldwide strategic partners such as ericsson ibm and nsn the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell competitors’ products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our valueadded resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues for example in 2006 one of our largest resellers lucent merged with alcatel a competitor of ours as a result of becoming a competitor their resales of our products declined subsequent to the merger and we ultimately terminated our reseller agreement our competitors may in some cases be effective in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to maintain and develop relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support it and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage for example we recently entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with nsn to develop and resell joint carrier ethernet solutions and entered into oem agreements with dell and ibm where they will rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios these relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement maintain and manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers or other partners as well as interfaces with the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers which enable them to build and ship our products if 

those systems fail or are interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed for example although it did not adversely affect our shipments an earthquake in late december of 2006 disrupted communications with china where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs 

 

we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example as we have expanded our contract manufacturing base to china we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturer was not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

 

we are currently implementing upgrades to key internal systems and processes and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with our business and operations 

 

in 2007 we initiated a multiyear project to upgrade certain key internal systems and processes including our companywide human resources management system our customer relationship management “crm” system and enterprise resource planning “erp” system we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes which may be disruptive to our underlying business any disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide service and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner file sec reports in a timely manner or otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more costly than anticipated our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

 

telecommunications companies and other large companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

 

telecommunications service provider companies and other large companies because of their size generally have greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

 

for example many customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result this class of customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

for arrangements with multiple elements our accounting policies require vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value of the undelivered to separate the components and to account for elements of the arrangement separately vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately however customers may require terms and conditions that make it more difficult or impossible for us to maintain vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements to a similar group of customers the result of which could cause us 

to defer the entire arrangement fees for a similar group of customers product maintenance professional services etc and recognize revenue only when the last element is delivered or if the only undelivered element is maintenance revenue we would recognize revenue ratably over the contractual maintenance period which is generally one year but could be substantially longer 

 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

 

our product gross margins will vary from quartertoquarter and the recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including product mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete increases in material or labor costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 

 

if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

 

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all if we fail to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to meet those needs in a timely manner such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance 

 

for example in 2008 we announced new products designed to address the ethernet switching market a market in which we had not had a historical presence in addition in 2009 we announced plans to develop and introduce new data center products with our project stratus and mobility solutions with our project falcon if these or other new products do not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets and aspirations may be adversely affected in addition if we fail to deliver new or announced products to the market in a timely manner it could adversely affect the market acceptance of those products and harm our competitive position and business and financial results 

 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement by tax effects of stockbased compensation by costs related to intercompany restructurings or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

for example in 2009 we received a proposed adjustment from the irs claiming that we owe additional taxes plus interest and possible penalties for the 2004 tax year based on a transfer pricing transaction related to the license of acquired intangibles under an intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement as a result of the proposed 

adjustment the incremental tax liability would be approximately 8070 million excluding interest and penalties we strongly believe the irs’ position with regard to this matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations and that our previously reported income tax provision for the year in question is appropriate however there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor regardless of whether this matter is resolved in our favor the final resolution of this matter could be expensive and timeconsuming to defend andor settle while we believe we have provided adequately for this matter there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of the matter could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenues 

 

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in penalties costs and restrictions on export privileges 

 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

 

we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers if we overestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time if we underestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time materials andor components required to produce our products which could increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues 

 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

 

during periods of high demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited any future growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed for example from time to time including the first quarter of 2008 we have experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of product shipments we currently purchase numerous key components including asics from single or limited sources the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if as a result we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is timeconsuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in other countries each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are a party to lawsuits which are costly to defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay damages or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits for example we are a party to a number of patent infringement and other lawsuits in addition we have been served with lawsuits related to the alleged backdating of stock options and other related matters a description of which can be found in note 13 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” there can be no assurance that these or any actions that have been or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor or that tentative settlements will become final regardless of whether they are resolved in our favor these lawsuits are and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely be expensive and timeconsuming to defend settle andor resolve such costs of defense as well as any losses resulting from these claims or settlement of these claims could significantly increase our expenses and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

litigation or claims regarding intellectual property rights may be timeconsuming expensive and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

 

third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies or enter into license agreements furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions 

 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale our business and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions in periods of market expansion we have increased 

investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in rd and other parts of our business conversely during 2009 in response to downward trending industry and market conditions we restructured our business rebalanced our workforce and reduced our real estate portfolio many of our expenses such as real estate expenses cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted because of fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees moreover rapid changes in the size of our workforce could adversely affect the ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 

 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quartertoquarter 

 

a customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customer’s network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quartertoquarter 

 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow then our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy and capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the build out of their next generation networks during the decisionmaking period when the customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure such pauses in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

a breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products which could cause us to lose revenues 

 

if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our security products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed this could cause us to lose current and potential endcustomers or cause us to lose current and potential valueadded resellers and distributors because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations 

 

we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located inside and outside of the united states in addition our rd and our general and administrative “ga” operations are conducted in the united states as well as other countries 

 

as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic regulatory social and political conditions in foreign countries including changes in general it spending the imposition of government controls changes or limitations in trade protection laws other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws natural disasters epidemic disease labor unrest earnings expatriation restrictions misappropriation of intellectual property military actions acts of terrorism political or social unrest and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations in particular in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that none of our employees contractors and agents will take actions in violation of them violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars and a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities however no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances including longterm declines in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the 

future if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

 

in addition we rely upon equity compensation to help recruit retain and motivate our employees at our 2010 annual meeting of stockholders we plan to ask our stockholders to authorize additional shares for grant under our 2006 equity incentive plan the “2006 plan” which is the only plan under which we currently grant stock options restricted stock units and performance shares to our employees if more shares or not enough shares are not authorized by our stockholders for grant under the 2006 plan we will be significantly limited in our ability to grant equity awards to recruit new employees or to compensate existing employees which would put us at a significant disadvantage to other companies that compete for workers in high technology industries such as ours accordingly our ability to hire retain and motivate current and prospective employees would be harmed the result of which could negatively impact our business operations 

 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors our business could be adversely affected and we may need to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers any errors defects or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition in the event an error defect or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention in addition if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products will be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be 

adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

 

integration of future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business in 2005 we completed the acquisitions of five privatelyheld companies acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership of our current stockholders assume liabilities record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition if we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from thirdparties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

matters related to the investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements have resulted in litigation and regulatory proceedings and may result in additional litigation or other possible government actions 

 

our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have exposed us to risks such as litigation regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions for more information regarding our current litigation and related inquiries please see note 13 commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” as well as the other risk factors related to litigation set forth in this section we have provided the results of our internal review and independent investigation to the sec and the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of california and in that regard we have responded to formal and informal requests for documents and additional information in august 2007 we announced that we entered into a settlement agreement with the sec in connection with our historical stock option granting practices in which we consented to a permanent injunction against any future violations of the antifraud reporting booksandrecords and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws this settlement concluded the sec’s formal investigation of the company with respect to this matter in addition while we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in determining the correct measurement dates for our stock option grants the sec may disagree with the manner in which we accounted for and reported or did not report the corresponding financial impact we are also subject to 

civil litigation related to the stock option matters in february 2009 we entered into an agreement in principle to settle the class action litigations claims related to our historical stock option granting practices under the proposed settlement which is subject to the approval of the board of trustees of the lead plaintiffs and the court the claims against us and our officers and directors will be dismissed with prejudice and released in exchange for a 169 million cash payment by us no assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from litigation or other possible government actions the resolution of these matters will be timeconsuming expensive and may distract management from the conduct of our business and the related costs of defense as well as any losses resulting from these claims or final settlement of these claims could significantly increase our expenses and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

 

we are required to test annually and review on an interim basis our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any future acquisitions to determine if impairment has occurred if such assets are deemed impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized this would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred for example such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock falls below certain levels for a sustained period or if the portions of our business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at expected rates or decline in the second quarter of 2006 our impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of 12800 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our balance sheet for the slt operating segment primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately nine months prior to the impairment review and to a lesser extent a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach recently the turmoil in credit markets and the broader economy has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours future declines in our stock price as well as any marked decline in our level of revenues or gross margins increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets 

 

while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 

 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer “ceo” chief financial officer “cfo” or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

 

regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects 

 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could address matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology and access charges for service providers in addition regulations have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the weee and rohs regulations adopted by the european union as well as regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified local certification criteria compliance with such regulations may be costly and timeconsuming for us and our suppliers and partners the adoption and implementation of such regulations could decrease demand for our products and at the same time could increase the cost of building and 

selling our products as well as impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

 

at december 31 2009 we had 16047 million in cash and cash equivalents and 10540 million in short and longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in us government securities governmentsponsored enterprise obligations foreign government debt securities corporate notes and bonds commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by us subprime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

 

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

set forth below is a reconciliation of the january 28 2010 announcement of our preliminary results press release to amounts reported in this annual report on form 10k which reflects the above mentioned adjustment in millions except per share amounts 

 

 

 

executive overview 

 

our performance for the fiscal year 2009 reflects the weakness in market demand for networking and security products compared to the fiscal year 2008 primarily due to our customers’ reaction to the weakened global economy the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the slowdown in the europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” service provider market while the global economy continues to challenge the marketplace our portfolioselling strategy enabled us to expand our depth and breadth in the enterprise and service provider markets during the second half of 2009 as a result the fourth quarter of 2009 was our strongest quarter in the enterprise market as well as in the service provider market in the us in addition we were able to navigate through challenging economic conditions by controlling operating costs while continuing to invest in innovation and customer satisfaction 

 

the following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 in millions except per share amounts and percentages 

 

 

  

business and market environment 

 

we design develop and sell products and services that together provide our customers with highperformance network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single network we serve the highperformance networking requirements of global service providers enterprises and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success highperformance networking is designed to provide fast reliable and secure access to applications and services at scale we offer a highperformance network infrastructure that includes ip routing ethernet switching security and application acceleration solutions as well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer investments 

 

in 2009 we continued to deliver new and innovative highperformance network infrastructure solutions we extended our junos software platform to include junos space network application platform and junos pulse integrated multiservice network client the launch of our next generation silicon trio enables 3d scaling and positions our mxseries routers as a “universal” edge platform for the networking market we announced the tx matrix plus a multichassis system for the t1600 core router which in conjunction with the jcs12000 control plane system brings virtualization to the core of the internet additionally we announced a significant technological advance with 100 gigabit ethernet interface cards for our t1600 core router we also delivered our adaptive threat management solution designed to help customers identify and respond to security incidents to help reduce overall risk we introduced a new solution for the intelligent services edge with the streamscope erm integrated video monitoring and analysis product which is designed to enable customers to extend the capabilities of our m and mxseries routers to enhance the quality of video services over cable wireless and internet protocol television networks 

 

our ethernet switching portfolio added the ex2200 switch platform the ex8208 a modular switching platform and the ex8216 a highcapacity modular switching platform designed for deployment in large enterprise data centers in addition our nextgeneration network infrastructure includes four new models of our srx family of dynamic services gateways we expanded our srx family of dynamic services gateways with the introduction of 

the srx3000 and extended the infrastructure for enterprises and started shipping the srx100 dynamic service gateway platforms our srx services gateways are sold into service provider and mobile packet core security markets as well as the enterprise market 

 

on the partnership front we announced entry into oem agreements with dell to offer our networking solutions under dell’s powerconnect brand and with ibm to resell our ethernet networking products and support to ibm’s data center customers in addition we entered in to a joint venture with nokia siemens networks bv “nsn” to develop and resell joint carrier ethernet solutions 

 

the recent weakness in the global economy has affected the purchasing behavior of our customers particularly among service providers and caused delays or reductions in purchase decisions which led to lower revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 as well as limited visibility regarding future business if economic growth in the us and other countries’ economies declines andor fails to recover our customers may further delay or reduce their purchases which could result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition we continue to plan to both invest in key rd projects that we believe will lead to future growth and remain focused on continuing our efforts to contain other costs and allocate resources effectively 

 

nature of expenses 

 

most of our manufacturing repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers accordingly most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for standard product costs the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications quality assurance programs and standards that we establish our independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products primarily in china malaysia mexico and the united states we have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor product testing and quality as of december 31 2009 and 2008 we had 244 and 230 employees respectively in our manufacturing and operations organization that primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor and manage product testing and quality we generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment 

 

the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts we may be and have been in the past liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 

 

in recent years an increasing amount of our products has been manufactured in asia and we anticipate that a larger percentage of our products will be produced outside the us in the future our contracts generally provide for passage of title and risk of loss at the designated point of shipment to our customer the manufacturing of products in asia for shipment to customers in emea and the americas resulted in additional shipment logistics freight and timing issues for us as well as those customers in an ongoing effort to balance our and our customers’ needs we have made changes on occasion to the payment of freight and the point of shipment with respect to products shipped from asia these changes affect shipping costs and the timing of revenue recognition of those shipments 

 

our operating expenses include rd sales and marketing and ga expenses rd expenses include costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products costs for outside services such as certifications of new products and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing several components of our rd effort require significant expenditures such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses we expense our rd costs as they are incurred sales and marketing expenses include costs for selling and promoting our products and services demonstration equipment and advertisements these costs vary quartertoquarter depending on revenues product launches and marketing initiatives we have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales we have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2009 2008 and 2007 ga expenses include professional fees bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses professional fees include legal audit tax accounting and certain corporate strategic services 

employeerelated costs have historically been the primary driver of our cost of service revenue and operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue employeerelated costs include items such as wages commissions bonuses vacation benefits stockbased compensation and travel we had 7231 7014 and 5879 employees as of december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the yearoveryear increases were primarily attributable to increases in our rd and customer service organizations our headcount is expected to increase in 2010 as we continue to expand these functions 

 

facility and information technology “it” departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount respectively despite an increase in headcount in 2009 these costs decreased due to our cost reduction initiatives facilities and it departmental costs increased in 2008 and 2007 due to increases in headcount and new facility leases added to support our growth facility and it related headcount was 294 267 and 224 as of december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in 2010 we expect to continue to invest in our companywide it infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives 

 

our cost of service revenues and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to cost of service revenues and operating expenses the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the appropriate line item of the consolidated statement of operations to which the hedged transaction relates any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations the decrease in cost of service revenues and operating expenses including rd sales and marketing as well as ga expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 2 in 2009 the increase in cost of service revenues and operating expenses including rd sales and marketing as well as ga expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1 and 2 in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

other event — listing on the new york stock exchange 

 

on october 6 2009 we submitted an application to transfer the listing of our company’s common stock to the nyse from nasdaq effective october 29 2009 we transferred our listing from nasdaq to the nyse under the symbol “jnpr” 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future consolidated results of operations may be affected

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

 

  

for arrangements with multiple elements such as sales of products that include services we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on the vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value of the undelivered items under the residual method the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends for specific products and services if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element in which case the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period we account for multiple agreements with a single customer as one arrangement if the contractual terms andor substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are in effect parts of a single arrangement our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value in addition our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers 

 

for sales to direct endusers valueadded resellers and oem partners we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment it is our practice to identify an enduser prior to shipment to a valueadded reseller or to an oem partner for our endusers and valueadded resellers there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits our agreements with our oem partners may allow future rights of returns or pricing credits a portion of our sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return we recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sellthrough as reported to us by the distributors deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sellthrough deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue 

 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments such as rebates and price protection in the same period that the related revenue is recorded the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits specific criteria included in rebate agreements and other factors known at the time should actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our estimates additional reductions to revenue may be required in addition we report revenue net of sales taxes 

 

service revenues include revenue from maintenance training and professional services maintenance is offered under renewable contracts revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period which is generally one year or less 

we sell certain interests in accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis as part of a customer financing arrangement primarily with one major financing company we record cash received under this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition as shortterm debt 

 

 38 

  

  

we utilize the blackscholesmerton “bsm” optionpricing model in order to determine the fair value of stockbased awards the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected option life and riskfree interest rate the expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options the expected life of an award is based on historical experience the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees as well as the potential effect from options that have not been exercised at the time 

 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expectedtovest shares if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate our recorded stockbased compensation expense could be different 

 

  

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our 

determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized as occurred in connection with the california tax law change in the first quarter of 2009 we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made for further discussion of the california tax law change refer to note 12 income taxes  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

 

significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions under fasb asc topic 740 and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves under fasb asc topic 740 are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made as it was during the second quarter of 2009 when we recorded a nonrecurring income tax charge as a result of a federal appellate court ruling in xilinx inc v commissioner  the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves under fasb asc topic 740 and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties if applicable 

 

  

from time to time we are involved in disputes litigation and other legal actions we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other thirdparty claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation andor substantial settlement charges in addition the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods if any of those events were to occur our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations which is incorporated herein by reference 

results of operations 

 

the following table presents product and service net revenues in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

our net product revenues decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased revenue from our routing products to service provider customers whose spending patterns were affected by the weakened global economy partially offset by increased revenues from our exseries switching products our net service revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the increase in professional services and maintenance revenue from our expanding installed base of equipment under service contracts 

 

our net product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased sales of products from both our infrastructure and slt solutions to the service provider and enterprise markets in particular we had success in selling our infrastructure products to service providers who are adopting next generation ip networks which are designed for higher capacity and efficiency to help reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network in 2008 our new product releases and further expansion into emerging markets contributed to the increase in total net product revenues our net service revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the increase in maintenance revenue from our expanding installed base of equipment under service contracts 

 

infrastructure segment revenues 

 

our infrastructure segment consists primarily of products and services related to the e m mx and tseries router product families exseries switching products as well as circuittopacket products the following table presents net infrastructure segment revenues and net infrastructure segment revenues as a percentage of total net revenues by product and service categories in millions except percentages 

 

 

infrastructure — product 

 

infrastructure product revenues decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased revenue in m t and eseries product families attributable to our customers’ reduced demand due to the global economic environment partially offset by revenue growth from our exseries switching products and mxseries products in 2009 we experienced a 23 decrease in product revenue from the service provider market and a 40 increase in product revenue from the enterprise market compared to the same period in 2008 the decrease in the service provider market was primarily due to decreased capital spending in that market and the increase in the enterprise market was primarily due to the growth in our exseries switching business and our continued focus on selling infrastructure products into the enterprise market which resulted in growth of enterprise revenues in americas and apac geographically infrastructure product revenue decreased in all three regions in 2009 

 

infrastructure product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily attributable to revenue growth from our m mx and tseries product families from sales to both the service provider and enterprise markets due to our customers’ increased demand for network infrastructure solutions to a lesser extent our exseries products which were introduced in the first quarter of 2008 and our eseries products also contributed to the revenue growth in 2008 in 2008 we experienced a 28 increase in product revenue from the service provider market and a 59 increase in product revenue from the enterprise market compared to the same period in 2007 from a geographical perspective in 2008 we experienced revenue growth in all three regions with particular strength in the americas region

contractual obligations 

 

our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments tax liabilities and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions

guarantees 

 

we have entered into agreements with some of our customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include guarantees of product and service performance guarantees related to thirdparty customer financing arrangements and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities as of december 31 2009 we had 340 million in guarantees and standby letters of credit and recorded a liability of 219 million related to a thirdparty customerfinancing guarantee as of december 31 2008 we had not recorded a liability related to our guarantees and indemnification arrangements 

 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

 

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the future additionally if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs our liquidity may be impacted as of december 31 2009 we have over 50 of our cash and investment balances held outside of the us which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 

 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next 12 months we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities the value of our investments are subject to market price volatility in addition as of december 31 2009 over 50 of our cash and marketable securities are held in nonus domiciled countries our marketable securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

 

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 related to the sales of our investments 

 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december 31 2009 and 2008 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

 

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

 

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense in the same period as the changes in the 

fair value from the remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of approximately two months 

 

our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to cost of service revenue and operating expenses these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations the decrease in operating expenses including cost of service revenue rd sales and marketing and ga expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 2 in 2009 in 2008 and 2007 the increase in cost of service revenue operating expenses including rd sales and marketing and ga due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1 and 2 respectively 

 

equity price risk 

 

our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities is inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates we monitor our publiclytraded equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis in the event that the carrying value of a publictraded equity investment exceeds its fair value and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value in 2008 we realized an impairment charge of 35 million on a publiclytraded equity security due to a sustained decline in excess of six months in the fair value of the investment below its cost basis that we judged to be other than temporary there was no such charge in 2009 we do not purchase our publiclytraded equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes they are classified as availableforsale securities on our consolidated balance sheets the aggregate fair value of our marketable equity securities was 54 million and 44 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively additionally our nonqualified deferred compensation “nqdc” plan may also hold publicly traded securities investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the total investments under the nqdc plan was 47 million and 10 million respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities would result in an immaterial loss 

 

our investments in privatelyheld companies are carried at cost in 2009 and 2008 we realized an impairment charge of 55 million and 113 million respectively on minority equity investments in privatelyheld companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in note 4 fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k the aggregate cost of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 139 million and 142 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer which are required in accordance with rule 13a14 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” this “controls and procedures” section includes information concerning the controls and related evaluations referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented 

 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act based upon that evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

changes in internal controls 

 

in 2007 we initiated a multiyear implementation to upgrade certain key internal systems and processes including our companywide human resources management system customer relationship management “crm” system and our enterprise resource planning “erp” system this project is the result of our normal business process to evaluate and upgrade or replace our systems software and related business processes to support our evolving operational needs there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2009 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our control system’s objective will be met and our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions 

about the likelihood of future events projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

our strategy 

 

our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of highperformance networking we offer a highperformance network infrastructure that creates a responsive and trusted environment for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single ipbased network our strategy is designed to advance the fundamentals and economics of highperformance networking key elements of our strategy are described below 

 

maintain and extend technology leadership 

 

our junos ® operating system applicationspecific integrated circuit “asic” technology and networkoptimized product architecture have been key elements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership we believe that these elements can be leveraged into future products that we are currently developing we intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in our research and development departments supplemented by external 

partnerships including strategic alliances as well as acquisitions that would allow us to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets 

 

leverage position as supplier of highperformance network infrastructure 

 

from inception we have focused on designing developing and building highperformance network infrastructure for demanding service provider and enterprise networking environments and have integrated purposebuilt technology into a networkoptimized architecture that specifically meets our customers’ needs we believe that many of these customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors we believe that the performance reliability and security of our products provide us with a competitive advantage which is critical in gaining selection as one of these vendors 

 

be strategic to our customers 

 

in developing our infrastructure and slt solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build bestinclass products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers that increased understanding has enabled us subsequently to design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date we plan to continue to work handinhand with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as to design future products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace while enabling customers to reduce costs 

 

enable new ipbased services 

 

our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and secure networks costeffectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products we believe that the secure delivery of ipbased services and applications including ip television “iptv” web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services outsourced enterprise applications and voiceover ip will continue to grow and are costeffectively enabled by our highperformance network infrastructure offerings 

 

establish and develop industry partnerships 

 

our customers have diverse requirements while our products meet certain requirements of our customers our products are not intended to satisfy certain other requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders in a diverse set of technologies and services that extend the value of the network for our customers these partnerships ensure that we have access to those technologies and services whether through technology integration joint development resale or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers’ requirements in addition we believe in an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation and provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs 

 

markets and customers 

 

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales and through distributors and valueadded resellers to endusers in the following markets 

 

service providers 

 

service providers include wireline wireless and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers supporting most major service provider networks in the world our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance reliability and security that service providers demand our networking infrastructure offerings benefit these customers by 

 

 3 

 

  

while many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline wireless or cable operators in recent years we have seen a move towards convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships we believe these strategic developments are made technically possible as operators invest in the build out of next generation networks “ngn” capable of supporting voice video and data traffic on to the same ipbased network this convergence relies on ipbased traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multiservice networks including new service offerings such as iptv these new services offer service providers significant new revenue opportunities 

 

we believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions these trends include significant growth in ip traffic on service provider networks because of peertopeer interaction broadband usage video and an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our ip customers and of their enterprise customers 

 

the ip infrastructure market for service providers includes products and technology at the network core the network edge to enable access the aggregation layer security to protect from the inside out and the outside in the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs and the management service awareness and control of the entire infrastructure 

 

we have sold our products to all of the 100 largest service providers in the world 

 

enterprise 

 

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the world’s most demanding businesses for this reason enterprises governments and research and education institutions that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications while 

 

  

since we first entered the market we have sold our products to more than 50000 enterprise customers 

 

as with the service provider market innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market we believe that innovative enterprises view the network as critical to their success and therefore must build advanced network infrastructures that provide fast reliable and secure access to services and applications over a single ipbased network these highperformance enterprises require networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors need to demonstrate performance reliability and security to these customers in specific segments with bestinclass open solutions for maximum flexibility we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers branch and campus applications distributed and extended enterprises and wide area network “wan” gateways 

 

as customers increasingly view the network as critical to their success we believe that customers will increasingly demand fast reliable and secure access to services and applications over a single ipbased network this is partly illustrated by the success of our integrated security gateway “isg” products that combine firewall 

virtual private network “vpn” and intrusion detection and prevention “idp” solutions in a single platform and secure services gateway “ssg” platforms that provide a mix of highperformance security with local area network “lan”wan connectivity for regional and branch office deployments we will continue to invest to develop these and other converged technologies and solutions 

 

our products and technology 

 

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created our infrastructure products are designed to address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless access by combining highperformance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a networkoptimized solution in addition as enterprises continue to develop and rely upon more sophisticated and pervasive internal networks we believe the need for products with highperformance routing and switching technology is expanding to a broader set of customers and we believe our expertise in this technology uniquely positions us to address this growing market opportunity 

 

additionally our slt segment offers a broad family of network security solutions that deliver highperformance costeffective security for enterprises service providers and government entities including integrated firewall and vpn solutions secure sockets layer “ssl” vpn appliances and idp appliances we also offer complementary products and technologies to enable our customers to provide additional ipbased services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and applications 

 

the following is an overview of our major infrastructure and slt product families

see item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this annual report on form 10k for an analysis of net product revenues by segment 

 

junos software 

 

in addition to our major product families junos software our flagship network operating system is a key technology element in our strategy to be the leader in highperformance networking we believe junos is fundamentally superior to other network operating systems in not only its design but also in its development the advantages of junos include 

 

  

junos software is designed to maintain continuous systems and improve the availability performance and security of business applications running across the network junos software helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity cost and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades this operational efficiency allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenuegenerating applications helping to advance the economics of highperformance networking 

 

the security and stability of junos software combined with its modular architecture and single source code base provides a foundation for delivering exceptional performance reliability security and scale at a total cost of ownership with an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage junos including routing switching and security products we believe junos software provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors 

customer service and support 

 

in addition to our infrastructure and slt products we offer the following services 24x7x365 technical assistance hardware repair and replacement parts unspecified software updates on a whenandifavailable basis professional services and educational services we deliver these services directly to endusers and utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and thirdparty organizations as appropriate 

 

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of education and support services to ensure locally delivered training 

 

as of december 31 2008 we employed 783 people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services 

 

manufacturing and operations 

 

as of december 31 2008 we employed 230 people in manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor and manage product testing and quality 

 

we have manufacturing relationships primarily with celestica flextronics and plexus under which we have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity our manufacturing activity is primarily conducted in canada china malaysia mexico and the united states 

 

this subcontracting activity in all locations extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

  

our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or endusers generally we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

 

although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis 

 

our asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources such as ibm corporation and toshiba corporation each of whom is responsible for all aspects of the production of the asics using our proprietary designs 

 

we have five core values trust respect humility integrity and excellence these values are integral to how we manage our company and interact with our employees customers partners and suppliers by working collaboratively with our suppliers we also have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted and promote the adoption by 

others of the electronic industry code of conduct the electronic industry code of conduct outlines standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible 

 

research and development 

 

as of december 31 2008 we employed 3194 people in our worldwide research and development organizations our research and development expenses totaled 7312 million 6230 million and 4803 million in the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols and embedded operating systems these individuals have worked in leading computer data networking and telecommunication companies 

 

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings in our infrastructure and slt products we are leveraging our software and asic technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers’ applications and continuing to develop ngn technology to support the anticipated growth in ip network requirements we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

 

our research and development process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our research and development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market 

 

sales and marketing 

 

as of december 31 2008 we employed 2190 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organizations these sales employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

 

our sales organization is organized into three geographic regions and within each region according to the particular needs in that market our three geographic regions are i the americas including united states canada mexico central and south america ii europe middle east and africa “emea” and iii asia pacific “apac” within each region there are regional and country teams to ensure we operate close to our customers 

 

see note 11 — segment information in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning our revenues by geographic regions and by significant customers which is incorporated herein by reference our operations subject us to certain risks and uncertainties associated with international operations see item 1a of part i “risk factors” for more information 

 

our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below in the united states and canada we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through resellers almost all of our sales outside the united states and canada are made through our channel partners 

 

direct sales structure 

 

where we have a direct relationship with our customers the terms and conditions are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgement of those orders or by purchase contracts in instances where we have direct contracts with our customers those contracts set forth only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products for this type of customer our sales team engages directly with the customer we directly receive and process customer purchase orders 

channel sales structure 

 

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we do the majority of our business we employ various channel partners including but not limited to 

 

  

within each region we employ sales professionals to assist with the management of our various sales channels in addition we have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly with the channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a direct relationship with our more strategic enduser customers while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of product through our channel partners 

 

our sales organization is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers with each separate team ensuring focus on the key customers in these respective markets there is a structure of sales professionals system engineers and marketing and channel teams each focused on the respective service provider and enterprise markets 

 

backlog 

 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers at any given time we have orders for products that have not been shipped and for services that have not yet been performed for various reasons because we believe industry practice would allow customers to cancel or change orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment or performance as well as our history of allowing such changes and cancellations we do not consider this backlog firm and do not believe our backlog information is necessarily indicative of future revenues 

 

seasonality 

 

many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first and third quarters in addition our slt segment has experienced seasonally strong customer demand in the fourth quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

competition 

 

infrastructure business 

 

in the network infrastructure business cisco systems has historically been the dominant player in the market however other companies such as alcatellucent brocade communications systems inc ericsson extreme networks inc huawei technologies co ltd and nortel networks corporation are providing competitive products in the marketplace 

 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco alcatellucent and huawei have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressure faced by us for example in 2006 alcatel combined with lucent technologies inc and ericsson acquired redback networks in addition many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could seriously harm our operating results 

 

slt business 

 

in the market for slt products cisco generally is our primary competitor with its broad range of products in addition there are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines within slt including checkpoint software technologies fortinet inc f5 networks inc nortel and riverbed technology inc these additional competitors tend to be focused on single product line solutions and therefore are generally specialized and focused as competitors to our products in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

 

for both product groups we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco alcatellucent huawei will introduce new products which are designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products consolidation in this industry has begun with one or more of these companies being acquired by large established suppliers of network infrastructure products and we believe it is likely to continue 

 

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful

we are subject to regulations that have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” and restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” regulations adopted by the european union in addition in september 2007 we announced our sponsorship and continued participation in the carbon disclosure project “cdp” cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors it hosts one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data in the world at wwwcdprojectnet we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis we believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world 

 

compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

in addition we are committed to the environment by our effort in improving the energy efficiency of key elements of our highperformance network product offerings for example our t1600 router consumes substantially less energy than competitive products the environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business 

 

intellectual property 

 

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise our operating systems were developed internally and are protected by united states and other copyright laws 

 

while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

 

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed or that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had 7014 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

 

our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

factors that may affect future results 

 

investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies involve significant risks the market price of our stock has historically reflected a higher multiple of expected future earnings than many other companies accordingly even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our stock price 

 

our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

 

the factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in the mix of products sold changing market conditions including current and potential customer consolidation competition customer concentration long sales and implementation cycles regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first and third quarters 

 

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenues andor earnings guidance 

 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results 

 

our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion have previously resulted and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings and could negatively impact our ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer relationships in addition recent turmoil in the global financial markets and associated economic weakness or recession particularly in the united states as well as turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions which could lead to reduced demand for our products andor higher costs of production economic downturns may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers an increase in bad debts restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments furthermore the recent disruption in worldwide credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the shortterm uncertainty about 

future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future or continued economic weakness customer financial difficulties increases in costs of production and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenues from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

 

a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners for example nsn and its predecessor companies contributed more than 10 of revenues in the fiscal years ended 2007 and 2006 this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results changes in the business requirements vendor selection or purchasing behavior of our key customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers in addition the recent disruption in worldwide credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition in recent years there has been consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example the acquisitions of att inc mci inc and bellsouth corporation and consolidation among the large vendors of telecommunications equipment and services for example the combination of alcatel and lucent the joint venture of nsn and the acquisition of redback by ericsson such consolidation may cause our customers who are involved in these acquisitions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or have other unforeseen consequences that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we receive infrastructure product orders late in a quarter we may be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our quarterly revenues 

 

generally our infrastructure products are not stocked by distributors or resellers due to their cost complexity and configurations required by our customers and we generally build such products as orders are received if orders for these products are received late in any quarter we may not be able to build ship and recognize revenue for these orders in the same period which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter 

 

telecommunications companies and other large companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

 

telecommunications service provider companies and other large companies because of their size generally have greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

 

for example many customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality andor had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers as a result this class of customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may affect our ability to recognize the revenues from such sales which may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example in april 2006 we announced that we would be required to defer a large amount of revenue from a customer due to the contractual obligations required by that customer 

 

for arrangements with multiple elements vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered element is required in order to separate the components and to account for elements of the arrangement separately 

vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately however customers may require terms and conditions that make it more difficult or impossible for us to maintain vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements to a similar group of customers the result of which could cause us to defer the entire arrangement fees for a similar group of customers product maintenance professional services etc and recognize revenue only when the last element is delivered or if the only undelivered element is maintenance revenue we would recognize revenue ratably over the contractual maintenance period which is generally one year but could be substantially longer 

 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers or other partners as well as interfaces with the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology systems “it” the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers which enable them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed for example although it did not adversely affect our shipments an earthquake in late december of 2006 disrupted communications with china where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs 

 

we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example as we have expanded our contract manufacturing base to china we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturer was not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

 

we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers if we overestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time if we underestimate our requirements our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time or materials and components required to produce our products which could increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues 

 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

 

with the current demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed for example from time to time including the first quarter of 2008 we have experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of product shipments we currently purchase numerous key components including asics from single or limited sources the development of alternate sources for those components 

is time consuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if as a result we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers which would seriously affect present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 

 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in other countries each of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

 

our product gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter and the recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including product mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete increases in material or labor costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 

 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 

 

a customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large or nextgeneration networks may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customer’s network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation 

that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 

 

we are a party to lawsuits which are costly to investigate and defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay damages or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits for example we have been served with lawsuits related to the alleged backdating of stock options and other related matters a description of which can be found in note 7 — commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” there can be no assurance that these or any actions that have been or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor regardless of whether they are resolved in our favor these lawsuits are and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to investigate defend settle andor resolve such costs of investigation and defense as well as any losses resulting from these claims or settlement of these claims could significantly increase our expenses and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition we are party to a lawsuit which seeks to enjoin us from granting equity awards under our 2006 equity incentive plan the “2006 plan” as well as to invalidate all awards granted under such plan to date the 2006 plan is the only active plan under which we currently grant stock options and restricted stock units to our employees if this lawsuit is not resolved in our favor we may be prevented from using the 2006 plan to provide these equity awards to recruit new employees or to compensate existing employees which would put us at a significant disadvantage to other companies that compete for workers in high technology industries such as ours accordingly our ability to hire retain and motivate current and prospective employees would be harmed the result of which could negatively impact our business operations 

 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow then our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

a substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy and capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the build out of their ngns during the decision making period when the customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure such pauses in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs or if those products do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

 

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner if we fail to anticipate market requirements or to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to meet those needs in a timely manner such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance for example in the first quarter of 2008 we announced new products designed to address the ethernet switching market a market in which we had not 

had a historical presence if these new products do not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

we rely on valueadded resellers and distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded reseller and distribution partners the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell competitors’ products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our valueadded resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues for example in april 2007 our largest customer siemens transferred its telecommunications business to a joint venture between siemens and nokia our competitors may in some cases be effective in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer 

 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support it and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial results 

 

competition is intense in the markets that we address the ip infrastructure market has historically been dominated by cisco with other companies such as alcatellucent brocade ericsson extreme networks huawei and nortel providing products to a smaller segment of the market in addition a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

 

in the slt market we face intense competition from a broader group of companies including appliance vendors such as cisco fortinet f5 networks nortel riverbed and software vendors such as checkpoint in addition a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address 

 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us in this regard alcatel combined with lucent in 2006 and ericsson acquired redback in 2007 a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions 

 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale our business and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions in periods of market expansion we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in research and development and other parts of our business conversely during 2001 and 2002 in response to downward trending industry and market conditions we restructured our business and reduced our workforce many of our expenses such as real estate expenses cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted because of fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees moreover rapid changes in the size of our workforce could adversely affect the ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 

 

we are currently implementing upgrades to key internal systems and processes and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with our business and operations 

 

in 2007 we initiated a project to upgrade certain key internal systems and processes including our companywide human resources management system our customer relationship management “crm” system and enterprise resource planning “erp” system we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes which may be disruptive to our underlying business any disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide service and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner file sec reports in a timely manner or otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more costly than anticipated our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

 

litigation or claims regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming expensive and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

 

third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be time consuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies or enter into license agreements furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations 

 

we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic regulatory and political conditions in foreign countries including changes in general it spending the imposition of government controls changes or limitations in trade protection laws unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws natural disasters labor unrest earnings expatriation restrictions misappropriation of intellectual property acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors which could have a material 

impact on our international revenues and operations in particular in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that none of our employees contractors and agents will take actions in violation of them violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

 

we are required to test annually and review on an interim basis our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any future acquisitions to determine if impairment has occurred if such assets are deemed impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized this would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred for example such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock falls below certain levels for a sustained period or if the portions of our business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at expected rates or decline in the second quarter of 2006 our impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of 12800 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our balance sheet for the slt operating segment primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately nine months prior to the impairment review and to a lesser extent a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach recently the turmoil in credit markets and the broader economy has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have reduced the market price of many technology company stocks including ours further declines in our stock price or the failure of our stock price to recover from previous declines as well as any marked decline in our level of revenues or gross margins increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets 

 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the research and development “rd” tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement by tax effects of stockbased compensation by costs related to intercompany restructurings or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen 

related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states in which we sell in us dollars and a weakened us dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities however no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances including longterm declines in the value of the us dollar if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful or if longterm declines in the value of the us dollar persist our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 

 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales and marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors our business could be adversely affected and we may need to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by endcustomers any errors defects or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers loss of future business and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition in the event an error defect or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a thirdparty vendor we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention in addition if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

a breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products which could cause us to lose revenues 

 

if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of our security products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed this could cause us to lose current and potential endcustomers or cause us to lose current and potential valueadded resellers and distributors because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 

 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products will be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

 

governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenues 

 

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues in addition failure to comply with such regulations could result in penalties costs and restrictions on export privileges 

 

integration of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business in 2005 we completed the acquisitions of five private companies acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we have acquired has been and will continue to be a complex time consuming and expensive process acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership of our current stockholders assume liabilities record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition if we fail in our acquisition integration efforts with respect to our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems 

operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

due to the global nature of our operations economic or social conditions or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located inside and outside of the united states in addition our research and development and our general and administrative operations are conducted in the united states as well as other countries accordingly our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others political or social unrest natural disasters epidemic disease war or economic instability in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

matters related to the investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements have resulted in litigation and regulatory proceedings and may result in additional litigation or other possible government actions 

 

our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have exposed us to risks such as litigation regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions for more information regarding our current litigation and related inquiries please see note 7 — commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” as well as the other risk factors related to litigation set forth in this section we have provided the results of our internal review and independent investigation to the sec and the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of california and in that regard we have responded to formal and informal requests for documents and additional information in august 2007 we announced that we entered into a settlement agreement with the sec in connection with our historical stock option granting practices in which we consented to a permanent injunction against any future violations of the antifraud reporting booksandrecords and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws this settlement concluded the sec’s formal investigation of the company with respect to this matter in addition while we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in determining the correct measurement dates for our stock option grants the sec may disagree with the manner in which we accounted for and reported or did not report the corresponding financial impact we are also subject to civil litigation related to the stock option matters no assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from litigation or other possible government actions the resolution of these matters will be time consuming expensive and may distract management from the conduct of our business furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in litigation or if we enter into any settlements related thereto we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 

 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

 

regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects 

 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could address matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology and access charges for service providers in addition regulations have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the weee and rohs regulations adopted by the european union as well as regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified local certification criteria compliance with such regulations may be costly and timeconsuming for us and our suppliers and partners the adoption and implementation of such regulations could decrease demand for our products and at the same time could increase the cost of building and selling our products as well as impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

 

at december 31 2008 we had 20191 million in cash and cash equivalents and 2743 million in short and longterm investments we have invested these amounts primarily in us government securities corporate notes and bonds commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria certain of these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by us subprime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

 

uninsured losses could harm our operating results 

 

we selfinsure against many business risks and expenses such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

this annual report on form 10k “report” including the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” contains forwardlooking statements regarding future events and the future results of juniper networks inc the “company” that are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management words such as ’expects’ ’anticipates’ ’targets’ ’goals’ ’projects’ ’intends’ ’plans’ ’believes’ ’seeks’ ’estimates’ variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed in this report under the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i and elsewhere and in other reports we file with the sec specifically the most recent reports on form 10q while forwardlooking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made you should not rely on them we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forwardlooking statements for any reason 

 

the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles in the course of operating our business we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices the collection of receivables the manufacturing and shipment of products the fulfillment of orders the purchase of supplies and the building of inventory and spare parts among other matters each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period in making these decisions we consider various factors including contractual obligations customer satisfaction competition internal and external financial targets and expectations and financial planning objectives the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns pricing credits warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges assumptions used in the valuation of stockbased compensation and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the significant events that affected the most recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed 

discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item 7 our “risk factors” section included in item 1a of part i and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in item 8 of part ii of this report 

 

executive overview 

 

our 2008 performance was the result of a combination of strong market demand for networking and security products as well as our focused execution and market share gains in addition we began shipment of several new products which contributed to our revenue growth during the year while revenue growth was substantial towards the end of 2008 worldwide economic conditions in particular the slowdown in the us led to slowing rates of growth and reduced our visibility into future periods during 2008 we continued implementation of a series of operational excellence initiatives these initiatives are intended to strengthen the management systems and processes throughout our organization to support our growth and to improve operational efficiency and contain costs in the face of difficult economic and market conditions

significant events 

 

business and market environment 

 

we design develop and sell products and services that together provide our customers with highperformance network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single ipbased network we serve the highperformance networking requirements of global service providers enterprises governments and research and education institutions that view the network as critical to their success highperformance networking is designed to provide fast reliable and secure access to applications and services at scale we offer a highperformance network infrastructure that includes ip routing ethernet switching security and application acceleration solutions as well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer investments 

 

in 2008 we continued to deliver new and innovative highperformance network infrastructure solutions we entered the enterprise switching market through the introduction of the exseries a family of ethernet switches that leverage the operational simplicity and carrierclass reliability of our junos software we also introduced a new category of extensible networking and security products with our srx series dynamic services gateways in addition we introduced a new family of idp appliances that deliver up to 10 gigabits per second realworld throughput and performance to enable deployments in the network core the integration of services including firewall and chassis clustering into junos software for implementation on the jseries services router and the security threat response manager “strm” a platform capable of providing businesses with a centralized scalable and effective way to log and manage a rapidly evolving threat landscape we also announced an advanced mobile ipmulti protocol label switching “mpls” solution portfolio with the new bx 7000 multiaccess gateway router for the cell site mseries circuit emulation physical interface cards for the aggregation site and a suite of software features designed to simplify deployment provisioning and management of mobile backhaul networks in addition we introduced the jcs 1200 a dedicated highperformance control plane scaling platform 

 

we also delivered new enhancements to existing solutions to help customers maximize their network infrastructure investments and lower their overall total cost of ownership we expanded our network and security manager “nsm” to deliver a centralized management solution for routing security and switching enabling customers to consolidate and simplify the management of their network infrastructure we announced enhancements to our access control solution to deliver enhanced scalability and performance with centralized access policy management via nsm helping customers cost effectively achieve comprehensive network visibility with broad enforcement capabilities we introduced the next generation of our wxc application acceleration platforms to deliver a more scalable modular and costeffective approach to delivering fast and consistent application response across the wan in addition we announced three new line card families for the mxseries ethernet services routers 

 

in 2008 the growing weakness of the global economy and in the united states in particular has affected the purchasing behavior of our customers and led to lower revenue growth in our fourth quarter compared to previous quarters delays in purchase decisions and reduced visibility regarding future business if economic growth in the united states and other countries’ economies continues to decline andor fail to recover our customers may delay or reduce their purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition in 2009 we will continue to invest in key research and development projects that we believe will lead to future growth while at the same time containing other costs and allocating resources effectively 

 

japan distributor audit 

 

in december 2008 during the course of our performance of routine distributor audits we became aware of facts that caused us to question the accuracy of point of sale reports of a few distributors in japan with respect to a small number of transactions as a result we commenced a review of revenue from sales through distributors in japan which was completed prior to the filing of this report as a result of this review we deferred 30 million of revenue for sales through distributors in japan total revenues through distributors in japan after the 30 million deferral were approximately 530 million in 2008 and approximately 130 million in the three months ended december 31 2008 for financial data for the quarter ended december 31 2008 which incorporates the results of 

this review please see note 13 — selected quarterly financial data unaudited in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

 

stock repurchase activity 

 

in 2008 we repurchased 6047 million or 251 million share of common stock under the following two stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors the “board” 

 

under the 20 billion stock repurchase program approved in 2006 and 2007 the “2006 stock repurchase program” we repurchased approximately 154 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 2453 per share for a total purchase price of 3768 million in 2008 as of december 31 2008 we had repurchased and retired approximately 848 million shares of our common stock under the 2006 stock repurchase program at an average price of 2358 per share the program has no remaining authorized funds available for future stock repurchases 

 

the board approved a 10 billion stock repurchase program in march 2008 the “2008 stock repurchase program” under this program we repurchased approximately 97 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 2343 per share for a total purchase price of 2279 million in 2008 as of december 31 2008 the 2008 stock repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of 7721 million see note 14 — subsequent events in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2009 

 

nature of expenses 

 

most of our manufacturing repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers accordingly most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications quality assurance programs and standards that we establish controls around manufacturing engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale california and westford massachusetts our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in canada china malaysia mexico and the united states we generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment 

 

the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts we may be and have been in the past liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 

 

in recent years an increasing amount of our products have been manufactured in asia and we anticipate that a larger percentage of our products will be produced outside the united states and canada in the future our contracts generally provide for passage of title and risk of loss at the designated point of shipment to the customer the manufacturing of products in asia for shipment to customers in emea and the americas resulted in additional shipment logistics freight and timing issues for us and those customers in an ongoing effort to balance our and the customers’ needs we have made changes on occasion to the payment of freight and the point of shipment with respect to products shipped from asia these changes impact shipping costs and the timing of revenue recognition of the affected shipments 

 

we have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor product testing and quality 

 

employeerelated costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue employeerelated costs include items such as wages commissions bonuses vacation benefits stockbased compensation and travel we had 7014 5879 and 4833 employees as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the yearoveryear increases were primarily attributable to increases in our research and development and sales and marketing organizations our headcount is expected to remain flat in 2009 as we continue our cost reduction activities we accounted for stockbased compensation under the fair value approach of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” in 2008 2007 and 2006 details of our stockbased compensation expense are described in note 10 — employee 

benefit plans in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

 

facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount respectively these departmental costs have increased in 2008 2007 and 2006 due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from infrastructure systems added to support our growth and past acquisitions facility and information technology related headcount was 267 224 and 177 as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2009 we expect to continue to invest in our companywide information technology infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives 

 

our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the appropriate line item of the consolidated statement of operations to which the hedged transaction relates any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations the increase in operating expenses including research and development sales and marketing as well as general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1 in 2008 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future results of operations may be affected 

 

  

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

 

 34 

 

for arrangements with multiple elements such as sales of products that include services we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on the vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value of the undelivered items under the residual method the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element in which case the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value in addition our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers 

 

for sales to direct endusers and valueadded resellers we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment it is our practice to identify an enduser prior to shipment to a valueadded reseller for our endusers and valueadded resellers there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return we recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sellthrough as reported to us by the distributors deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sellthrough deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue 

 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments such as rebates and price protection in the same period that the related revenue is recorded the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits specific criteria included in rebate agreements and other factors known at the time should actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our estimates additional reductions to revenue may be required in addition we report revenue net of sales taxes 

 

services include maintenance training and professional services maintenance is offered under renewable contracts revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period which is generally one year or less 

 

we sell certain interests in accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis as part of a distributor accounts receivable financing arrangement primarily with one major financing company we record cash received under this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition as shortterm debt with a balance of 330 million and 100 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

 35 

  

  

we utilize the blackscholesmerton “bsm” optionpricing model and incorporate a monte carlo simulation when appropriate in order to determine the fair value of stockbased awards under sfas 123r the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected option life and riskfree interest rate the expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options the expected life of an award is based on historical experience the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees as well as the potential effect from options that have not been exercised at the time 

 

the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expectedtovest shares if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate our recorded stockbased compensation expense could be different 

 

 36 

  

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

 

on january 1 2007 we adopted financial interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” which was a change in accounting for income taxes fin 48 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas 109 the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement additionally fin 48 provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosures and transition the application of fin 48 may increase an entity’s future effective tax rates and its future intraperiod effective tax rate volatility as of january 1 2007 our cumulative effect of applying fin 48 was a 192 million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit and a 10 million increase to goodwill 

 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions under fin 48 and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves under fin 48 are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves under fin 48 and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties if applicable 

 

 37 

  

from time to time we are involved in disputes litigation and other legal actions we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other thirdparty claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation andor substantial settlement charges in addition the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods if any of those events were to occur our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses

results of operations 

 

the following table shows total net product and service revenues and net product and service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

our net product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased sales of products from both our infrastructure and slt solutions to the service provider and enterprise markets in particular we had success in selling our infrastructure products to service providers who are adopting ngn ip networks which are designed for higher capacity and efficiency to help reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network in 2008 our new product releases and further expansion into emerging markets contributed to the increase in total net product revenues our net service revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the increase in maintenance revenue from our expanding installed base of equipment under service contracts 

 

our net revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to growth in both product and service revenues our revenue performance and share gains were driven by infrastructure and slt product revenues service revenues also increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the increase in our installed base of equipment under service contracts and to a lesser extent growth in professional service revenues 

changes to segments 

 

beginning in january 2008 we realigned our reporting structure which resulted in two segments infrastructure and slt the previously reported service segment has been combined into the following two segments 

 

  

infrastructure segment revenues 

 

the following table shows net infrastructure segment revenues and net infrastructure segment revenues as a percentage of total net revenues by product and service categories in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

 

  

infrastructure — product 

 

infrastructure product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily attributable to revenue growth from our mmx and tseries product families from sales to both the service provider and enterprise markets due to our customers’ increased demand for network infrastructure solutions to a lesser extent our exseries products which were introduced in the first quarter of 2008 and our eseries products also contributed to the revenue growth in 2008 in 2008 we experienced sales growth in both the service provider and enterprise markets from a geographical perspective in 2008 we experienced revenue growth in all three regions with particular strength in the americas region 

 

infrastructure product revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily attributable to increased revenues from our m t and mxseries router products driven by our service provider customers’ continued buildout of ngns as their bandwidth requirement increased our service provider customers also moved towards ngns that are designed to enable a fast and costeffective deployment of differentiating multiplay services that allow them to generate new sources of revenues also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in infrastructure product sales to the content service provider and the enterprise markets from a geographical perspective we experienced revenue growth in all three regions with particular strength in the americas region 

 

we track infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth most of our infrastructure product platforms are modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces the modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module chassis revenue units represent the number of 

chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period the following table shows infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped 

 

 

 

 

  

infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the product mix that favored higher capacity chassis revenue units which was driven by bandwidth demand as our customers sought to expand capabilities in their networks and to offer differentiating featurerich multiplay services that allow them to generate new sources of revenues the port shipments also increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the increase in the overall number of chassis revenue units from richly configured t and mseries router chassis revenue units shipped during the 2008 period 

 

chassis revenue units increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the introduction of the mxseries products which are our carrier ethernet services routers we also experienced growth in our m and tseries products driven by bandwidth demand as service provider customers sought to expand voice and video capability in their existing networks the port shipment units increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the growth in chassis revenue units with larger expansion capacity and our customers’ need to differentiate themselves by providing featurerich multiplay services 

 

infrastructure — service 

 

infrastructure service revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment being serviced installed base is calculated based on the number of systems that our customers have under maintenance a majority of our service revenues is earned from customers that purchase our products and simultaneously enter into service contracts for support service we also experienced increased professional service revenues due to consulting projects 

 

infrastructure service revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily driven by increased technical support service contracts associated with higher infrastructure product sales which have resulted in increased renewals and a larger installed base of equipment being serviced to a lesser extent professional services also contributed to the growth in net service revenues in 2007 professional service revenues increased primarily due to large customer deployments requiring consulting services 

 

slt segment revenues 

 

the following table shows net slt segment revenues and net slt segment revenues as a percentage of total net revenues by product and service categories in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

 

 40 

 

slt — product 

 

slt product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in revenues from firewall and jseries products these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenues from dx and wx products the integrated systems introduced prior to 2007 such as the ssg firewall products gained further traction in the market place with revenues from these product lines growing in 2008 compared to 2007 in 2008 we experienced sales growth both in the service provider and enterprise markets geographically revenues increased in the emea and apac regions and decreased in the americas region 

 

slt product revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily attributable to the increased revenues across the majority of the slt product families in particular the firewall ssl wan optimization and jseries products the integrated systems introduced prior to 2007 such as the isg and ssg firewall products gained traction in the market place and generated additional revenues in 2007 all three geographic regions had significant growth in slt revenues during 2007 we experienced a growing demand for our slt products in both the enterprise and service provider markets as we focused on crossselling more integrated products and solutions in the enterprise and service provider markets while leveraging partnerships with open standardsbased interoperability of our slt products 

 

the following table shows slt revenue units recognized 

 

 

 

slt revenue units increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007 the percentage increase in slt revenue units was lower than the percentage increase in product revenues primarily due to the product mix that favored products with higher average selling prices 

 

in january 2008 we announced a plan to phase out our dx product line these products will be supported until 2013 we do not expect this plan to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

slt revenue units increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily attributable to the growing demand for our slt products in the market place the percentage increase in slt revenue units was greater than the percentage increase in product revenues primarily due to the increased revenues from sales of our branch firewall products which have lower average selling price than other slt products 

 

slt — service 

 

slt service revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment being serviced a majority of our service revenues is earned from customers that purchase our products and simultaneously enter into support service contracts 

 

slt service revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily driven by an increase in support service contracts associated with the increase in slt product sales to a lesser extent professional services also contributed to the growth in net service revenues in 2007

net interest and other income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to lower interest rates during 2008 

 

net interest and other income decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 resulting from a decrease in interest income due to a lower cash cash equivalents and investment balance which was attributable to common stock repurchases of approximately 16 billion during the first and second quarters of 2007 partially offsetting the decreases was the higher interest yield combined with higher positive cash flows from operations compared to 2006 interest and other expenses slightly increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to costs associated with our distributor financing program see note 8 — debt in notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for a full description of our distributor financing program other interest 

and expenses include shortterm debt expenses debt issuance cost amortization foreign exchange losses and other miscellaneous expenses such as bank fees 

 

loss gain on equity investments 

 

during 2008 we recognized impairment losses of 148 million on our investments in privatelyheld and publiclytraded companies for changes in fair value that we believed were other than temporary in june 2007 one of the companies in which we had a minority equity investment completed an initial public offering “ipo” as a result we realized a gain of 67 million during 2007 based upon the difference between the market value of our investment at the time of the ipo and our cost basis during 2006 none of our investments had any recognized gain or loss 

 

income tax provision 

 

our effective tax rates were 298 293 and 116 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in the overall rate in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to the differences in the geographic mix of our taxable income and the level of research and development credits in the us the 2006 effective tax rate differs from 2008 and 2007 primarily due to the inability to benefit from a substantial portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2006 

 

we are currently under examination by the irs for the 2004 tax year the indian tax authorities for the 2004 tax year and the german tax authorities for the 2005 tax year additionally we have not reached a final resolution with the irs on an adjustment it proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax years we are not under examination by any other major jurisdictions in which we file income tax returns as of december 31 2008 

 

in september 2008 as part of the ongoing 2004 irs audit we received a proposed adjustment related to our business credit carryforwards which if agreed would reduce our business credit carryforwards in december 2008 we received a proposed adjustment from the indian tax authorities related to the 2004 tax year we are pursuing all available administrative procedures relative to these matters in december 2008 we reached a tentative settlement with the german tax authorities for the 2005 tax year we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these proposed adjustments and the ultimate resolution of these matters is unlikely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

 

we do not expect complete resolution of any irs or other audits within significant foreign or state jurisdictions within the next 12 months however it is reasonably possible that we may reach agreement with certain issues and as a result the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately 130 million within the next 12 months 

 

for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and further explanation of our income tax provision see note 12 — income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k

infrastructure segment 

 

an analysis of the change in revenues for the infrastructure segment and the change in revenue units can be found above in the section titled “net revenues” 

 

infrastructure segment operating income increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to revenue growth from our router product families and to a lesser extent our new ethernet switching product family which outpaced 

expense growth infrastructure product gross margin increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to revenues from richly configured highend t and mseries router products as well as highmargin port shipments the infrastructure gross margin percentage decreased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to product mix particularly from an increase in the mix of lowermargin eseries products in 2008 

 

we continued to invest in research and development efforts to continue our innovation of products and expand our infrastructure product portfolio but our research and development expense decreased as a percentage of infrastructure net revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to cost control initiatives that resulted in revenue growing faster than expenses we will continue to make investments to expand our product features and functionality based upon the trends in the marketplace additionally our sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of infrastructure net revenues but increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007 as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers we allocate sales and marketing general and administrative as well as facility and information technology expenses to the infrastructure segment generally based upon revenue usage and headcount 

 

infrastructure segment operating income increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to revenue growth from our router product families which outpaced expense growth our increase in revenue was partially offset by our continued investments in research and development efforts as we sought to continue our innovation of products and expand our infrastructure product portfolio in 2007 our sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues but increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers 

 

slt segment 

 

an analysis of the change in revenues for the slt segment and the change in units can be found above in the section titled “net revenues” 

 

slt segment operating income increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to revenue growth in our firewall and jseries products and the growth in our installed equipment base for service contracts which outpaced the increase in slt expenses slt product gross margin and gross margin percentage increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to product mix particularly from an increase in the mix of highermargin firewall and jseries products in 2008 research and development related costs increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of slt revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the addition of headcount in regions with lower operating costs and revenue growing faster than research and development expenses additionally sales and marketing as well as general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of slt net revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to our focused execution we allocate sales and marketing general and administrative as well as facility and information technology expenses to the slt segment generally based on revenue usage and headcount in the past we have generally experienced quarterly seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our slt products particularly in the fourth quarter which may result in greater variations in our quarterly operating results 

 

slt segment operating income increased slightly in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to revenue growth which outpaced the increase in slt expenses slt product gross margin and gross margin percentage increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to product mix particularly from an increase that favored highermargin products the increase in slt operating expenses was due primarily to the increase in information technology expenses allocated to the slt segment and the higher variable compensation expenses associated with companywide revenue growth additionally we strategically invested in our research and development efforts to develop technologies and products for the junos platform in an effort to control costs we moved a significant portion of the slt development organization to lower cost regions while expanding our product portfolio slt segment operating income was affected by continued investments in our sales and distribution channels slt gross margin decreased slightly in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher manufacturing costs associated with new and more complex products higher manufacturing costs were partially offset by our costreduction efforts to move more manufacturing to lower cost regions the increases in slt operating expenses were partially offset by our revenue growth especially in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to increased customer demand for security products particularly firewall and due to typical quarterly seasonality 

stockbased compensation and related payroll taxes 

 

stockbased compensation expense increased in 2008 compared to 2007 the increase was primarily attributable to new stock options and rsu grants during 2008 and the timing of the recognition of stockbased compensation expense for rsus granted in the last month of the fourth quarter of 2007 stockbased compensation related payroll tax expense which represents employment taxes we incurred in connection with our employee stock programs decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 changes in such expenses are primarily attributable to the timing and volume of stock options exercises by our employees we experienced a considerable decrease in these expenses due to the decrease in our share price during 2008 

 

stockbased compensation expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to new stock options and rsu grants partially offset by the lower stock option expense in 2007 resulting from the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested and “outofthemoney” stock options completed in december 2005 “2005 stock option vesting acceleration” stockbased compensation related payroll tax expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 we experienced a considerable increase in these expenses due to the increase in our share price during 2007 in contrast employee stock option exercises were restricted during the majority of 2006 due to our stock option investigation 

 

key performance measures 

 

in addition to the financial metrics included in the consolidated financial statements we use the following key performance measures to assess operating results 

 

 

 

 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our consolidated balance sheet and cash flows contractual obligations other commitments and our stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources 

 

overview 

 

historically we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and the issuance of our common stock the following table shows our capital resources in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable reduced by accounts payable accrued liabilities and deferred revenue the increase in 

working capital from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 is primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and the noncash settlement of the current portion of longterm debt due to the maturity of our senior convertible notes in june 2008 see note 8 — debt in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for discussion of our senior convertible notes the increase in cash and cash equivalents during 2008 is primarily due to cash generated by our operating activities of 8752 million along with the issuance of common stock for 1195 million through stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan purchases partially offset by repurchases of our common stock of 6047 million 

 

summary of cash flows 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 8752 million 7865 million and 7556 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income loss adjusted by 

 

  

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities was 1498 million for 2008 as compared to net cash generated by investing activities of 5718 million in 2007 in 2006 cash generated by investing activities was 119 million the changes between periods was primarily due to the movement of cash from short and longterm investments to cash and cash equivalents during 2007 in anticipation of stock repurchases under the 2006 stock repurchase program 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 4224 million 12385 million and 896 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2008 we used 6047 million to repurchase our common stock partially offset by cash proceeds of 1195 million from common stock issued to employees compared to the 16232 million of common stock repurchases in 2007 partially offset by cash proceeds of 3550 million from common stock issued to employees in 2006 we used 1864 million to repurchase our common stock partially offset by cash proceeds of 871 million from common stock issued to employees 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

none 

contractual obligations 

 

our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases purchase commitments tax liabilities and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

guarantees 

 

we have entered into agreements with some of our customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include guarantees of product and service performance and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification and guarantee provisions and our guarantees and indemnification arrangements have not had any significant impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

stock repurchase activities 

 

in 2008 we repurchased 6047 million or 251 million shares of common stock under the following two stock repurchase programs authorized by our board 

 

under the 20 billion stock repurchase program approved in 2006 and 2007 the “2006 stock repurchase program” we repurchased approximately 154 million shares of its common stock at an average price of 2453 per share for a total purchase price of 3768 million during 2008 as of december 31 2008 we have repurchased and retired approximately 848 million shares of our common stock under the 2006 stock repurchase program at an average price of 2358 per share and the program had no remaining authorized funds available for future stock repurchases 

 

the board approved another 10 billion stock repurchase program in march 2008 the “2008 stock repurchase program” under this program we repurchased approximately 97 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 2343 per share for a total purchase price of 2279 million in 2008 as of december 31 2008 the 2008 stock repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of 7721 million 

 

all shares of common stock purchased under the 2006 and 2008 stock repurchase programs have been retired future share repurchases under our 2008 stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements this program may be discontinued at any time see note 14 — subsequent events in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2009 

 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

 

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the future additionally if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our 2008 stock repurchase program our liquidity may be impacted we also have a substantial portion of our cash and investment balances held overseas and may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 

 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations debt and growth for at least the next 12 months we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period however our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities in addition a portion of our cash and marketable securities are held in nonus domiciled countries our marketable securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

 

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 

 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december 31 2008 and 2007 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 

 

 

 

 

these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

 

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

 

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months 

 

our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates we record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations the increase in operating expenses including research and development sales and marketing as well as general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1 in 2008 

 

equity price risk 

 

our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities is inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates we monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis in the event that the carrying value of the equity investments exceeds its fair value and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value in 2008 we realized an impairment charge of 35 million on a publiclytraded equity security due to a sustained decline in the fair value in excess of six months of the investment below its cost basis that we judged to be other than temporary we do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes the aggregate fair value of our marketable equity securities was 44 million and 86 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities would result in an immaterial loss 

 

in addition to publiclytraded securities we have also invested in privatelyheld companies these investments are carried at cost in 2008 we realized an impairment charge of 113 million on minority equity investments in privatelyheld companies that we judged to be other than temporary the aggregate cost of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 142 million and 233 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer which are required in accordance with rule 13a14 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” this “controls and procedures” section includes information concerning the controls and related evaluations referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented 

 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act based upon that evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

changes in internal controls 

 

in 2007 we initiated a multiyear implementation to upgrade certain key internal systems and processes including our companywide human resources management system customer relationship management “crm” system and our enterprise resource planning “erp” system this project is the result of our normal business process to evaluate and upgrade or replace our systems software and related business processes to support our evolving operational needs there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our control system’s objective will be met and our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions 

about the likelihood of future events projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

overview 

 

we design develop and sell products and services that together provide our customers with highperformance network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single internet protocol “ip”based network we serve the highperformance networking requirements of global service providers enterprises governments and research and education institutions that view the network as critical to their success highperformance networking is designed to provide fast reliable and secure access to applications and services we offer a highperformance network infrastructure that includes bestinclass ip routing ethernet switching security and application acceleration solutions as well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer investments 

 

in the fiscal year ended december 31 2007 we experienced growth in both product and service revenues we also generated strong net income operating margin and cash flows from operations during 2007 we believe these results were driven by market demands and our focused execution of our two fundamental objectives to establish our growth and momentum in the highperformance networking marketplace as reflected by top line performance and to improve our leverage against those revenues as demonstrated by the bottom line improvements in our financial results 

 

our operations are organized into three reportable segments infrastructure service layer technologies “slt” and service our infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable routing products that are used to control and direct network traffic from the core through the edge aggregation and the customer premise equipment level infrastructure products include our ip routing and carrier ethernet routing portfolio as well as our recently announced ethernet switching portfolio our slt segment offers solutions that meet a broad array of our customer’s priorities from protecting the network itself and protecting data on the network to maximizing existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications across a distributed network slt products include firewall and virtual private network “vpn” systems and appliances secure sockets layer virtual private network “ssl” appliances intrusion detection and prevention “idp” appliances application front end platforms the jseries router product family integrated secure services gateway “ssg” secure router product offerings and wide area network “wan” optimization platforms together our highperformance network infrastructure offerings help enable our customers to convert legacy networks that provide commoditized best efforts services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation and value and increased performance reliability and security to end users our service segment delivers worldwide services to customers of the infrastructure and slt segments 

 

during our fiscal year ended december 31 2007 we generated net revenues of 28 billion and conducted business in more than 100 countries around the world see item 8 of part ii for more information on our consolidated financial position as of december 31 2007 and 2006 and our consolidated results of operations consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 

 

we were incorporated in california in 1996 and reincorporated in delaware in 1998 our corporate headquarters are located in sunnyvale california our website address is wwwjunipernet 

 

our strategy 

 

our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of highperformance networking we offer a highperformance network infrastructure that creates a responsive and trusted environment for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single ipbased network we believe our open network infrastructure provides customers with greater choice and control in quickly meeting highperformance business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs our strategy is designed to advance the fundamentals and economics of highperformance networking key elements of our strategy are described below 

maintain and extend technology leadership 

 

our applicationspecific integrated circuit “asic” technology junos operating system and networkoptimized product architecture have been key elements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership we believe that these elements can be leveraged into future products that we are currently developing we intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in our research and development departments supplemented by external partnerships including strategic alliances as well as acquisitions that would allow us to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets 

 

leverage position as supplier of highperformance network infrastructure 

 

from inception we have focused on designing developing and building highperformance network infrastructure for demanding service provider and enterprise networking environments and have integrated purposebuilt technology into a network optimized architecture that specifically meets our customers’ needs we believe that many of these customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors we believe that the performance reliability and security of our products provide us with a competitive advantage which is critical in gaining selection as one of these vendors 

 

be strategic to our customers 

 

in developing our infrastructure and slt solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build bestinclass products specifically designed to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers that increased understanding has enabled us to subsequently design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date we plan to continue to work handinhand with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as to design future products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace while enabling customers to reduce costs 

 

enable new ipbased services 

 

our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and secure networks costeffectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products we believe that the secure delivery of ipbased services and applications including ip television “iptv” web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services outsourced enterprise applications and voiceover ip will continue to grow and are costeffectively enabled by our highperformance network infrastructure offerings 

 

establish and develop industry partnerships 

 

our customers have diverse requirements while our products meet certain requirements of our customers our products are not intended to satisfy certain other requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders in a diverse set of technologies and services that extend the value of the network for our customers these partnerships ensure that we have access to those technologies and services whether through technology integration joint development resale or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers’ requirements in addition we believe in an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation and provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements while enabling them to reduce costs 

markets and customers 

 

we sell our highperformance network products and service offerings through direct sales and through distributors and valueadded resellers to endusers in the following markets 

 

service providers 

 

service providers include wireline wireless and cable operators as well as major internet content and application providers supporting most major service provider networks in the world our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance reliability and security that service providers demand our networking infrastructure offerings benefit these customers by 

 

  

while many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline wireless or cable operators in recent years we have seen a move towards convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions mergers and partnerships we believe these strategic developments are made technically possible as operators invest in the build out of next generation networks “ngn” capable of supporting voice video and data traffic on to the same ipbased network this convergence relies on ipbased traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multiservice networks including new service offerings such as iptv these new services offer service providers significant new revenue opportunities 

 

we believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions these trends include significant growth in ip traffic on service provider networks as a result of peertopeer interaction broadband usage video and an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our ip customers and of their enterprise customers 

 

the ip infrastructure market for service providers includes products and technology at the network core the network edge to enable access the aggregation layer security to protect from the inside out and the outside in the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs and the management service awareness and control of the entire infrastructure 

 

we have sold our products to all of the 65 largest service providers in the world 

 

enterprise 

 

our highperformance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance reliability and security requirements of the world’s most demanding businesses for this reason enterprises federal state and local governments and research and education institutions that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications while

the enterprise market continued to be an important part of our business growth during 2007 driven in particular by growth in the second half of the year since we first entered the market we have sold our products to more than 30000 enterprise customers 

 

as with the service provider market innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market we believe that innovative enterprises view the network as critical to their success and therefore must build advanced network infrastructures that provide fast reliable and secure access to services and applications over a single ipbased network these highperformance enterprises require networks that are global distributed and always available network equipment vendors need to demonstrate performance reliability and security to these customers in specific segments with bestinclass open solutions for maximum flexibility we offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers branch and campus applications distributed and extended enterprises and wan gateways 

 

as customers increasingly view the network as critical to their success we believe that customers will increasingly demand fast reliable and secure access to services and applications over a single ipbased network this is partly illustrated by the increasing success of our integrated security gateway “isg” products that combine firewallvpn and idp solutions in a single platform and ssg platforms that provide a mix of highperformance security with local area network “lan”wan connectivity for regional and branch office deployments we will continue to invest to develop these and other converged technologies and solutions 

 

fundamental requirements for high performance networking 

 

our service provider customers have clearly communicated their fundamental business requirement to quickly and costeffectively deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue 

 

our enterprise customers are under pressure to accelerate the delivery of serviceenabling applications to build differentiation and sustainable growth 

 

in parallel both service providers and enterprises must focus on proactively detecting and preventing the ever increasing number of security threats facing the network itself and the data that flows across the network this security must be innate to networking products and must not come at the expense of overall performance or unjustifiable cost 

 

this is driving the fundamental requirement for highperformance networking providing fast reliable and secure access to applications and services over a single ipbased network feature richness high reliability security high performance scalability and cost effectiveness are each fundamental requirements in meeting the needs associated with the growth in ip traffic and the delivery of valueadded services to end users 

 

feature richness the importance of increasing revenue streams and decreasing capital and operational costs for our customers is a significant priority in the industry service providers want to quickly and cost effectively deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue enterprises and other network operators want to accelerate the delivery of serviceenabling applications to build differentiation and growth each of these goals is ultimately a function of the features and capabilities that can be securely provided on each of the network elements as networks advance more and more features are required to sell new services as well as to lower the ongoing costs of operating the network next generation networking solutions therefore need to have flexibility to add new capabilities frequently without compromising the performance of the system which gets increasingly difficult as the network demands increase 

 

high reliability as businesses and consumers increasingly rely on ip networks for missioncritical applications high network reliability is critical to success as a result those businesses and consumers expect service providers to deliver a high degree of reliability in their networks 

 

security today’s network environment presents an everincreasing number of challenges regarding network security ranging from simple denial of service attacks to sophisticated pervasive and malicious intrusions the importance of security is increasing within all of our customers and we are continually improving and evolving the security capabilities on all of our product solutions it is extremely important to provide comprehensive network 

based security services that are fully integrated free of performance tradeoffs and scaleable to any customer or market 

 

highperformance without compromising intelligence to handle the rapid growth in ip traffic today’s customers increasingly require fast reliable and secure networking solutions that can operate at higher speeds while still delivering realtime services such as security and qualityofservice features the processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated forwarding technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination based on priority data type and other considerations because a large number of ip packets many of which perform critical administrative functions are small in size highperformance ip routers need to achieve their specified transmission speeds even for small packet sizes because smaller packets increase packet processing demands routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be more resource intensive than routing of larger packets a wire speed router which achieves its specified transmission rate for any type of traffic passing through it can accomplish this task thus provisioning of missioncritical services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed processing 

 

highperformance under stressful conditions in a large and complex network individual components inevitably fail however the failure of an individual device or link must not compromise the network as a whole in a typical network when a failure occurs the network loses some degree of capacity and in turn a greater load falls on the remaining network routers which must provide alternate routes highperformance network infrastructure must quickly adapt to the new state of the network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping significant numbers of packets when active routes are lost or when large numbers of routes change routing protocols are used to accomplish this convergence a process that places even greater stress on the router given the complexity of ip network infrastructure the convergence process is complex and places a far greater load on the router thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device 

 

scalability due to the rapid growth in ip traffic service providers must continuously expand their networks both in terms of increased numbers of access points of presence “pops” and also greater capacity per pop to facilitate this expansion process secure networking solutions must be highly scalable next generation network appliances therefore need to be flexible and configurable to function within constantly changing networks while incurring minimal downtime 

 

high return on investment continued growth in ip traffic price competition in the telecommunications market and increasing pressure for network operators to attain higher returns on their network infrastructure investments all contribute to our customers’ desire for solutions that significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build and operate their networks in addition to the basic cost of equipment network operators incur substantial ancillary costs for the space required to deploy the equipment power consumed and ongoing operation and maintenance of the equipment network operators therefore want to deploy dense and varied equipment configurations in limited amounts of rack and floor space with increasing consideration to energy and cooling requirements and costs therefore in order to continue to scale their networks toward higher data speeds in a cost effective manner network operators need the ability to mix and match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities without significantly increasing the consumption of space or power and driving costs higher 

 

these requirements define a clear need for highperformance networking solutions that have been designed to support high speeds and offer new ipbased services at the same time network operators are eagerly seeking new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within their networks while reducing the cost and complexity of their architectures 

 

our technology and products 

 

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific highperformance requirements of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created our infrastructure products are designed to address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless access by combining highperformance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a networkoptimized solution in addition as enterprises continue to develop and rely upon more sophisticated and pervasive internal networks we believe the need for products with highperformance routing technology is 

expanding to a broader set of customers and we believe our expertise in this technology uniquely positions us to address this growing market opportunity 

 

additionally we offer a broad family of network security solutions that deliver highperformance costeffective security for enterprises service providers and government entities including firewall and vpn systems and appliances ssl appliances and idp appliances with the 2005 acquisitions of funk software inc “funk” peribit networks inc “peribit” redline networks inc “redline” and kagoor networks inc “kagoor” we added complementary products and technologies to our product families that enable our customers to provide additional ipbased services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and applications 

 

infrastructure products 

 

we believe that an overview of the physical nature of our infrastructure products is helpful in understanding the operation of our business 

 

although specific designs vary among our product families our router platforms are essentially modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform the chassis contains components that enable and support many of the fundamental functions of the router such as power supplies cooling fans and components that run the operating system perform highspeed packet forwarding or keep track of the structure of the network and instruct the packet forwarding components where to send packets each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 

 

the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from the network over a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module in some cases modules do not contain ports or physically receive packets from the network but rather provide additional capabilities or features that enhance the overall functionality of the router we refer to these components as service modules 

 

our new exseries family of ethernet switches include virtual chassis and fixed configuration design elements virtual chassis technology allows up to ten switches to be interconnected and operate as a single system thereby enabling higher port density in a compact and efficient form factor our fixed configuration switch platforms offer a costeffective standalone solution for lowdensity deployments 

 

major infrastructure product families are summarized as follows

slt products 

 

slt products provide network security solutions and enable our customers to provide additional ipbased services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and applications 

 

major slt product families are summarized as follows 

 

 8 

 

  

in 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 we announced several significant new products in our infrastructure and slt product categories including but not limited to the following 

 

infrastructure 

 

  

slt

see note 11 in item 8 for a breakdown of net product revenues by segment 

 

customer service and support 

 

in addition to infrastructure products and slt products we offer the following services 24x7x365 technical assistance hardware repair and replacement parts unspecified software updates on a when and if available basis professional services and educational services we deliver these services directly to major end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and thirdparty organizations as appropriate 

 

we also train our channel partners in the delivery of education and support services to ensure locally delivered training 

 

as of december 31 2007 we employed 748 people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services 

 

manufacturing and operations 

 

as of december 31 2007 we employed 190 people in manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor and manage product testing and quality 

 

we have manufacturing relationships primarily with celestica flextronics and plexus under which we have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity our manufacturing activity is primarily conducted in canada china and the united states 

 

this subcontracting activity in all locations extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

  

our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on rolling forecasts from us about our product demands each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and test the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or endusers generally we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

 

although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis 

 

our asics are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources such as ibm corporation and toshiba corporation each of whom is responsible for all aspects of the production of the asics using our proprietary designs 

 

juniper networks has at its core five key values trust integrity respect humility and excellence these values are integral to how we manage our company and interact with our employees customers partners and suppliers by working collaboratively with our suppliers we also have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond juniper networks and into our worldwide supply chain to this end we have adopted and promote the adoption by others of the electronic industry code of conduct the electronic industry code of conduct outlines standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible 

 

research and development 

 

as of december 31 2007 we employed 2563 people in our worldwide research and development organizations our research and development expenses totaled 6230 million 4803 million and 3573 million in the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design asic design security routing protocols and embedded operating systems these individuals have worked in leading computer data networking and telecommunications companies 

 

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings in our infrastructure and slt products we are leveraging our asic technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customer applications and continuing to develop next generation technology to support the anticipated growth in ip network requirements we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

 

our research and development process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects following an assessment of market demand our research and development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market 

 

sales and marketing 

 

as of december 31 2007 we employed 1863 people in our worldwide sales and marketing organizations these sales employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers 

 

our sales organization is organized into three geographic regions and within each region according to the particular needs in that market our three geographic regions are i the americas including united states canada mexico central and south america ii europe middle east and africa and iii asia pacific within each region there are regional and country teams to ensure we operate close to the customer 

 

the sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below in the united states and canada we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through resellers almost all of our sales outside the united states and canada are made through our channel partners 

 

see note 11 in item 8 for information concerning our revenues by significant customers and by geographic region our operations subject us to certain risks and uncertainties associated with international operations see item 1a of part i “risk factors” for more information 

direct sales structure 

 

where we have a direct relationship with our customers the terms and conditions are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgement of those orders or by purchase contracts in instances where we have direct contracts with our customers those contracts set forth only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products for this type of customer our sales team engages directly with the customer customer purchase orders are received and processed directly by juniper networks 

 

channel sales structure 

 

a critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we do the majority of our business we employ various channel partners 

 

  

within each region we employ sales professionals to assist with the management of our various sales channels in addition we have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly with the channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a direct relationship with our more strategic end user customers while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of product through our channel partners 

 

our sales organization is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers with each separate team ensuring focus on the key customers in these respective markets there is a structure of sales professionals system engineers and marketing and channel teams each focused on the respective service provider and enterprise markets 

 

backlog 

 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers at any given time we have orders for products that have not been shipped and for services that have not yet been performed for various reasons because we believe industry practice would allow customers to cancel or change orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment or performance as well as our history of allowing such changes and cancellations we do not consider this backlog to be firm and do not believe our backlog information is necessarily indicative of future revenue 

seasonality 

 

many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first and third quarters in addition our slt segment has experienced seasonally strong customer demand in the fourth quarter this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance 

 

competition 

 

infrastructure business 

 

in the network infrastructure business cisco systems has historically been the dominant player in the market however other companies such as alcatellucent ericsson extreme networks inc foundry networks inc huawei technologies co ltd and nortel networks corporation are providing competitive products in the marketplace 

 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco alcatellucent huawei and nortel have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressure faced by us for example in 2006 alcatel combined with lucent technologies inc and ericsson acquired redback networks also many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could seriously harm our operating results 

 

slt business 

 

in the market for slt products cisco generally is our primary competitor with its broad range of products in addition there are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines within slt including checkpoint software technologies fortinet inc f5 networks inc nortel and riverbed technology inc these additional competitors tend to be focused on single product line solutions and therefore are generally specialized and focused as competitors to our products in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

 

for both product groups we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco alcatellucent huawei and nortel will introduce new products which are designed to compete more effectively in the market there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products consolidation in this industry has begun with one or more of these companies being acquired by large established suppliers of network infrastructure products and we believe it is likely to continue 

 

as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

 

environment 

 

we are subject to regulations that have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” and restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” regulations adopted by the european union in addition in september 2007 we announced our sponsorship and continued participation in the carbon disclosure project “cdp” cdp is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors it hosts one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data in the world at wwwcdprojectnet we continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and 

measure our carbon footprint on a global basis since 2005 we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world 

 

compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

 

in addition we are committed to the environment by our effort in improving the energy efficiency of key elements of our highperformance network product offerings for example our t1600 router consumes substantially less energy than competitive products the environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business 

 

intellectual property 

 

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and knowhow our operating systems were developed internally and are protected by united states and other copyright laws 

 

while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

 

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed or that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had 5879 fulltime employees we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

 

our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

factors that may affect future results 

 

investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies involve significant risks the market price of our stock reflects a higher multiple of expected future earnings than many other companies accordingly even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger and have triggered significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our stock price 

 

our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

 

the factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in the mix of products sold changing market conditions including current and potential customer consolidation competition customer concentration long sales and implementation 

cycles regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first and third quarters 

 

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

 

fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results 

 

our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion have previously resulted for example in 2001 and 2002 and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings and could negatively impact our ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer relationships economic downturns may also lead to restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the shortterm uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future economic weakness customer financial difficulties and reductions in spending on network expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our results of operations and stock price 

 

telecommunications companies and other large companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues 

 

telecommunications service provider companies and other large companies because of their size generally have had greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms 

 

for example many customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality andor had products that caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers as a result this class of customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may affect our ability to recognize the revenues from such sales which may negatively affect our business and our financial condition for example in april 2006 we announced that we would be required to defer a large amount of revenue from a customer due to the contractual obligations required by that customer 

 

for arrangements with multiple elements vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered element is required in order to separate the components and to account for elements of the arrangement separately vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately however customers may require terms and conditions that make it more difficult or impossible for us to maintain vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements to a similar group of customers the result of which could cause us to defer the entire arrangement fees for a similar group of customers product maintenance professional services etc and recognize revenue only when the last element is delivered or if the only undelivered element is maintenance revenue would be recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance period which is generally one year but could be substantially longer 

if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs or if those products do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

 

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner if we fail to anticipate market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business and financial results even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance for example in the first quarter of 2008 we announced new products designed to address the ethernet switch market a market in which we have not had a historical presence if these new products do not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth or at all our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

 

our product gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter and the recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including product mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete increases in material or labor costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 

 

we rely on valueadded resellers and distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded reseller and distribution partners the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell competitors’ products or their own competitive products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our valueadded resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues during 2006 alcatel a valueadded reseller and a competitor of ours acquired lucent one of our largest valueadded resellers in addition in april 2007 our largest customer siemens transferred its telecommunications business to nokiasiemens networks a joint venture between siemens and nokia our competitors may in some cases be effective in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer 

 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenue based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support it and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

 

we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers if we overestimate our requirements the contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time if we underestimate our requirements the contract manufacturers may have inadequate time or materials and components required to produce our products which could increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues 

 

our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers suppliers or other partners as well as interfaces with the systems of such third parties if our systems the systems and processes of those third parties or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed for example although it did not adversely affect our shipments an earthquake in late december of 2006 disrupted communications with china where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs 

 

we also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products if those systems and processes experience interruption or delay our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed for example as we have expanded our contract manufacturing base to china we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturer was not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us if we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed 

 

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

 

with the current demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed for example throughout the first quarter of 2006 we experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of shipments of product until late in the quarter and in an increase in our day sales outstanding we currently purchase numerous key components including asics from single or limited sources the development of alternate sources for those components is time consuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if as a result we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers which would seriously impact present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

 

we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 

 

we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of which is a thirdparty manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management moreover an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in other countries each of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial results 

 

competition is intense in the markets that we address the ip infrastructure market has historically been dominated by cisco with other companies such as alcatellucent ericsson extreme networks foundry networks huawei and nortel providing products to a smaller segment of the market in addition a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and market segments that our products address 

 

in the service layer technologies market we face intense competition from a broader group of companies including appliance vendors such as cisco fortinet f5 networks nortel and riverbed and software vendors such as checkpoint in addition a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address 

 

in addition actual or speculated consolidation among competitors or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us in this regard alcatel combined with lucent in 2006 and ericsson acquired redback in 2007 a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

 

a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and increases the degree of customer concentration risk and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

 

a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners nokiasiemens networks bv “nsn” and its predecessor companies contributed more than 10 of revenue in the fiscal years ended 2007 2006 and 2005 this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any downturn in the business of our key customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers which could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations in addition there has been and continues to be consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example the acquisitions of att inc mci inc and bellsouth corporation and consolidation among the large vendors of telecommunications equipment and services for example the combination of alcatel and lucent the joint venture of nokiasiemens networks and the acquisition of redback by ericsson such 

consolidation may cause our customers who are involved in these acquisitions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or have other unforeseen consequences that could harm our business and operating results 

 

we are a party to lawsuits which are costly to investigate and defend and if determined adversely to us could require us to pay damages or prevent us from taking certain actions any or all of which could harm our business and financial condition 

 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits for example we have been served with lawsuits related to the alleged backdating of stock options and other related matters a description of which can be found in note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “legal proceedings” there can be no assurance that these or any actions that have been or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor regardless of whether they are resolved in our favor these lawsuits are and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to investigate defend andor resolve such costs of investigation and defense as well as any losses resulting from these claims could significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our profitability and cash flow 

 

in addition we are party to a lawsuit which seeks to enjoin us from granting equity awards under our 2006 equity incentive plan the “2006 plan” as well as to invalidate all awards granted under such plan to date the 2006 plan is the only active plan under which we currently grant stock options and restricted stock units to our employees if this lawsuit is resolved against us we may be prevented from using the 2006 plan to provide these equity awards to recruit new employees or to compensate existing employees which would put us at a significant disadvantage to other companies that compete for workers in high technology industries such as ours accordingly our ability to hire retain and motivate current and prospective employees would be harmed the result of which could negatively impact our business operations 

 

we are currently implementing upgrades to key internal it systems and problems with the design or implementation of these systems could interfere with our business and operations 

 

we have initiated a project to upgrade certain key internal it systems including our companywide human resources management system and our enterprise resource planning “erp” system we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems which may be disruptive to our underlying business any disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the new systems particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations file sec reports in a timely manner and otherwise run our business even if we do not encounter these adverse effects the design and implementation of these new systems may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

 

litigation or claims regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming expensive and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

 

third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products regardless of the merit of these claims they have been and can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies or enter into license agreements furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any thirdparty is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows 

 

because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

 

our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen related to our operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in us dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies a decrease in the value of the us dollar could also increase the real cost to us of our expenses in countries outside the united states 

 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency operating expenses the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to partially offset the impact of currency fluctuations if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful our net income could be adversely impacted 

 

we are required to expense equity compensation given to our employees which has reduced our reported earnings will significantly harm our operating results in future periods and may reduce our stock price and our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees 

 

we historically have used stock options and other equity awards as a significant component of our employee compensation program in order to align employees’ interests with the interests of our stockholders encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation packages the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes that require companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives we adopted this standard effective january 1 2006 by causing us to record significantly increased compensation costs such accounting changes have reduced and will continue to reduce our reported earnings and will significantly harm our operating results in future periods these factors may require us to reduce the availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees which may make it more difficult for us to attract retain and motivate key personnel moreover if securities analysts institutional investors and other investors adopt financial models that include stock option expense in their primary analysis of our financial results our stock price could decline as a result of reliance on these models with higher expense calculations each of these results could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

matters related to the investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements may result in additional litigation regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions 

 

our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions for more information regarding our current litigation and related inquiries please see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “legal proceedings” as well as the other risk factors related to litigation set forth in this section we have provided the results of our internal review and independent investigation to the securities and exchange commission “sec” and the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of california and in that regard we have responded to formal and informal requests for documents and additional information in august 2007 we announced that we entered into a settlement agreement with the sec in connection with our historical stock option granting practices in which we consented to a permanent injunction against any future violations of the antifraud reporting booksandrecords and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws this settlement concludes the sec’s formal investigation of the company with respect to this matter no assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from the current litigation or other possible actions relating to our past stock option practices the resolution of these matters will be time consuming expensive and may distract management from the conduct of our business furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in 

litigation we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

in addition while we believe that we have made appropriate judgments in determining the correct measurement dates for our stock option grants the sec may disagree with the manner in which we accounted for and reported or did not report the corresponding financial impact accordingly there is a risk that we may have to further restate our prior financial statements amend prior filings with the sec or take other actions not currently contemplated 

 

if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively affected 

 

our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions 

 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale our business and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions in periods of market expansion we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in research and development and other parts of our business conversely during 2001 and 2002 in response to downward trending industry and market conditions we restructured our business and reduced our workforce many of our expenses such as real estate expenses cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted as a result of fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees moreover rapid changes in the size of our workforce could adversely affect the ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 

 

our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive engineering sales marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

 

we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow then our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth of secure ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy and capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition a number of our existing customers are evaluating the build out of their next generation network or ngn during the decision making period when the customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in 

those networks such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure ip infrastructure such pauses in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and even where our products are ultimately selected can have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

 

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 

 

a customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large or nextgeneration networks may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customer’s network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 

 

integration of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business in 2005 we completed the acquisitions of five private companies acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we have acquired has been and will continue to be a complex time consuming and expensive process acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership of our current stockholders assume liabilities record goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition 

 

in addition if we fail in our integration efforts with respect to our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 

 

our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors our business could be adversely affected and we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by end customers any errors or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely 

affect our business and results of operations in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention in addition if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition could be harmed 

 

a breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products which could cause us to lose revenues 

 

if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of our security products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed this could cause us to lose current and potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential valueadded resellers and distributors because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 

 

if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products will be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

 

governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenues 

 

the united states and various other governments have imposed controls export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues 

 

due to the global nature of our operations economic or social conditions or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in countries throughout the world and also depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located inside and outside of the united states in addition our research and development operations are conducted in the united states as well as other countries our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others political or social unrest natural disasters epidemic disease war or economic instability in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue costs expenses results of operations and financial condition 

our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to risks arising from our international operations 

 

we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic regulatory and political conditions in foreign countries including changes in it spending generally the imposition of government controls changes or limitations in trade protection laws unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws natural disasters labor unrest earnings expatriation restrictions misappropriation of intellectual property acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors which could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations in particular in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violations of them violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 

 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

 

regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects 

 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could address matters such as voice over the internet or using internet protocol encryption technology and access charges for service providers in addition regulations have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” and restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” regulations adopted by the european union as well as regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified local certification criteria compliance with such regulations may be costly and timeconsuming for us and our suppliers and partners the adoption and implementation of such regulations could decrease demand for our products and at 

the same time could increase the cost of building and selling our products as well as impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

our reported financial results could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

 

we are required to annually test and review on an interim basis our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any future acquisitions to determine if impairment has occurred if such assets are deemed impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized this would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred for example such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock falls below certain levels for a sustained period or if the portions of our business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at expected rates or decline in the second quarter of 2006 this impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of 12800 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our balance sheet for the slt segment primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately nine months prior to the impairment review and to a lesser extent a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach declines in our stock prices in the future as well as any marked decline in our level of revenues or gross margins increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets 

 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

 

our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement by tax effects of stockbased compensation by costs related to intercompany restructurings or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

 

the investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments

from a geographical perspective net revenues grew across the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” regions 

 

  

significant events 

 

business and market environment 

 

in 2007 we benefited from the continued progress by our service provider customers in the buildout of next generation networks “ngn” designed to support a fast and costeffective deployment of multiple types of services “multiplay services” such as voice data and video that enable our customers to develop new sources of revenue and profitability we maintained a strong position in the infrastructure product business and gained share in key market segments we also experienced an increased interest in our slt portfolio due to increased network demand from our enterprise customers as well as growth from service providers using our slt products for both managed service offerings and outsourced solutions for their customers additionally we continued our momentum in the enterprise market for our slt products as well as routing products portfolio we now serve over 95 of the fortune 100 companies and more than 30000 enterprise customers worldwide in addition over 45 out of the 50 state governments in the united states have deployed our technologies 

 

we believe our innovation and market momentum have enabled us to maintain relationships with our partners including strategic resellers alcatellucent ericsson inc and nokiasiemens networks bv “nsn” while developing broader relationships with technology leaders such as international business machines corporation “ibm” and microsoft corporation to better serve our customers

in 2007 we completed the restatement of our historical financial statements as a result of our independent stock option investigation and review of historical stock compensation practices in addition we regained compliance with listing standards of the nasdaq global select market we recorded 60 million in operating 

expenses during 2007 in connection with this stock option investigation compared to 205 million and nil in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

in april 2007 we completed a tender offer to amend certain options granted under the juniper networks inc amended  restated 1996 stock plan and the juniper networks inc 2000 nonstatutory stock option plan that had original exercise prices per share that were less than the fair market value per share of the common stock underlying the option on the option’s grant date as determined by us for financial accounting purposes under this tender offer employees subject to taxation in the united states and canada had the opportunity to increase their strike price on affected options to the appropriate fair market value per share on the date of grant so as to avoid unfavorable tax consequences under united states internal revenue code section 409a “409a issue” or canadian tax laws and regulations in exchange for increasing the strike price of these options we committed to make a cash payment to employees participating in the offer so as to make these employees whole for the incremental strike price as compared to their original option exercise price in connection with the offer we amended options to purchase 43 million shares of our common stock in 2007 and made aggregate cash payments of 76 million to offer participants in january 2008 we accrued this aggregate payment liability and recognized an operating expense for the corresponding amount during 2007 

 

settlement with the securities and exchange commission 

 

on august 28 2007 we announced that the commissioners of the sec authorized the settlement between us and the sec regarding the previously disclosed sec inquiry into our historical stock option granting practices without admitting or denying the allegations in the sec’s complaint we agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against any future violations of the antifraud reporting booksandrecords and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws no monetary penalties were assessed against us in conjunction with this settlement this settlement concludes the sec’s formal investigation of the company with respect to our historical stock option granting practices 

 

adoption of fin 48 

 

we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” on january 1 2007 the first day of fiscal 2007 under fin 48 an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold the cumulative effect of applying fin 48 was a 192 million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of january 1 2007 and a 10 million increase to goodwill 

 

as of the date of adoption the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was 852 million of which 708 million if recognized would affect our effective tax rate 

 

in accordance with our accounting policy we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations this policy did not change as a result of the adoption of fin 48 we accrued interest expense and penalties of 41 million within other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of the date of adoption 

 

we conduct business globally and as a result we or one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world including such major jurisdictions as ireland hong kong uk france germany the netherlands japan china australia and the us with few exceptions we are no longer subject to us federal state and local or nonus income tax examinations for years before 2003 although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to 2003 may still be adjusted upon examination by the irs if the attributes either have been or will be used in a future period 

nature of expenses 

 

most of our manufacturing repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers accordingly most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications quality assurance programs and standards that we establish controls around manufacturing engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale california and westford massachusetts our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in canada china malaysia and the united states we generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment 

 

the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts we may be and have been in the past liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 

 

we have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor product testing and quality 

 

employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue employee related costs include items such as wages commissions bonuses vacation benefits stockbased compensation and travel we had 5879 4833 and 4145 employees as of december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the yearoveryear increases were primarily attributable to increases in our research and development sales and customer service activities our headcount is expected to increase in 2008 as we continue to expand these functions we accounted for stockbased compensation under the fair value approach of fas 123r in 2007 and 2006 in 2005 we accounted for stockbased compensation under the intrinsic value approach of apb 25 details of our stockbased compensation expense are described in note 1 and note 9 in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k 

 

facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount these departmental costs have increased in 2007 and 2006 due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from infrastructure systems added to support our growth and past acquisitions facility and information technology related headcount was 224 177 and 168 as of december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively in 2008 we expect to further invest in our companywide information technology infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives 

 

our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations the increase in operating expenses including research and development sales and marketing as well as general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging was approximately 2 in 2007 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management’s estimates to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future results of operations will be affected 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

  

for arrangements with multiple elements such as sales of products that include services we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items under the residual method the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element in which case the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value in addition our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers 

 

for sales to direct endusers and valueadded resellers we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss which is generally upon shipment it is our practice to identify an enduser prior to shipment to a valueadded reseller for our endusers and valueadded resellers there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits andor rights of return we recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sellthrough as reported to us by the distributors deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sellthrough deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue 

 

we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments such as rebates and price protection in the same period that the related revenue is recorded the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits specific criteria included in rebate agreements and other factors known at the time additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates in addition we report revenue net of sales taxes 

 

services include maintenance training and professional services maintenance is offered under renewable contracts revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period which is generally one to three years revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period which is generally one year or less 

 

we sell certain interests in accounts receivables as part of a distributor accounts receivable financing arrangement which was established by us with a major financing company accounts receivables sold under 

this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition are accounted for as debt and were 100 million and nil as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively

on january 1 2007 we adopted fin 48 fin 48 is an interpretation of fasb statement 109 accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally fin 48 provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosures and transition under fin 48 an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold in addition the application of fin 48 may increase an entity’s future effective tax rates and its future intraperiod effective tax rate volatility our cumulative effect of applying fin 48 was a 192 million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of january 1 2007 and a 10 million increase to goodwill

results of operations 

 

net revenues 

 

the following table shows total net product and service revenues and net product and service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

our total net revenues increased 5325 million or 23 to 28361 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 our total net revenues increased 2396 million or 12 to 23036 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 the increases in both years were primarily due to the demand growth in the markets we serve in addition we gained market share in several areas and capitalized on the opportunities in our targeted markets with our new and existing product and service offerings during 2007 

 

net product revenues 

 

our net product revenue increased 4337 million or 23 from 2006 to 23270 million in 2007 the increase was the result of increased activity in both infrastructure product and slt product sales to service provider and enterprise markets in particular we had success in selling our products to customers who are adopting ngn ip networks which are designed to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network in addition we had a number of new product releases and expanded into new emerging markets during 2007 net product revenue grew 1223 million or 7 from 2005 to 2006 the majority of which was generated from our slt product revenue growth in 2006 

 

the following table shows total net product revenues and net product revenues as a percentage of total net revenues by product category in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

infrastructure product revenues 

 

infrastructure product revenues accounted for 17532 million or 618 of total net revenues and increased 3398 million or 24 in 2007 compared to 2006 we benefited from the strong worldwide demand for highperformance router products as our service provider customers seek simplified scalable network infrastructures across fiber cable and mobile access technologies to support increasing performance demands on their networks the infrastructure product revenue increase in 2007 was primarily attributable to increased revenue from our m t and 

mxseries router products driven by our service provider customers’ continued build out of ngn as their bandwidth requirement increases our service provider customers also moved towards ngns designed to enable a fast and costeffective deployment of differentiating multiplay services that allow them to generate new sources of revenue also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in infrastructure product sales to the content service provider and the enterprise markets from a geographical perspective we experienced strength in the americas region we also experienced revenue increases in apac and emea 

 

infrastructure products accounted for 14134 million or 614 of our total net revenues during 2006 and 13716 million or 665 of our total net revenues during 2005 infrastructure product net revenue grew by 418 million or 3 from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to continued success from a very significant year of growth in 2005 which strengthened our position as a supplier to the largest service providers in the world particularly in the americas and in emea we experienced revenue growth in higherend infrastructure chassis products and increased penetration by our core and edge router portfolio as service providers acquired products for their ngns and multiplay service offerings this growth was partially offset by a pause in the build out of ngns and associated purchase decisions particularly in japan as major carriers prepare for the next stage of bandwidth and services expansion and a large product revenue deferral as of december 31 2006 for products shipped to one of our largest customers 

 

we track infrastructure chassis revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period the following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped 

 

 

 

chassis revenue units increased 10 from 2006 to 2007 as our customers expanded the capacity in their existing networks the increase was mainly due to the introduction of the mxseries products which are our carrier ethernet base routers we also experienced growth in our m and tseries products driven by bandwidth demand as service provider customers sought to expand voice and video capability in their existing networks port shipment units increased by 41 in 2007 as compared to 2006 the increase was associated with the growth in chassis revenue units with larger expansion capacity and the customers’ need to differentiate themselves by providing featurerich multiplay services 

 

chassis revenue units slightly increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to the sales of higherend tseries and mseries products and the inclusion of the chassis units related to a 2005 acquisition partially offset by decreases in sales of lowerend eseries and mseries products sales of higherend chassis units increased as our customers continued to adopt and expand ip networks in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network port shipment units increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the increase in port demands driven by the larger expansion capacity in the higherend chassis revenue units shipped during 2006 partially offset by the lower port capacity in the ctpseries chassis revenue units 

 

slt product revenues 

 

slt product revenues accounted for 202 of total net revenues and increased 939 million or 20 to 5738 million in 2007 compared to 2006 the revenue increase was due to sales increases across the majority of the slt product families particularly the firewall ssl wan optimization and jseries products our customers’ 

demands for slt products grew due to their increasing focus on addressing the risks associated with connecting and delivering critical network services and business applications the integrated systems introduced prior to 2007 such as the isg and ssg firewall products gained traction in the market place and generated additional revenue in 2007 the revenue increase from our ssl products was due to our deployments of ssl solutions to enterprises and governments who were seeking to enhance their remote access to data and applications we experienced considerable improvement in revenue from our wan optimization application acceleration platforms as customers sought to boost the responsiveness of their networks all three geographic regions had significant growth in slt sales during 2007 we experienced a growing demand for our slt products in both the enterprise and service provider markets as we focused on crossselling more integrated products and solutions in the enterprise and service provider markets while leveraging partnerships with open standards based interoperability of our slt products in addition we benefited from typical fourthquarter seasonality we generally experienced seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our slt products which may result in greater variations in our quarterly revenue 

 

in january 2008 we announced a plan to phase out our dx product line these products will be supported until 2013 we do not expect this plan to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 

slt products accounted for 4799 million or 208 of our total net revenues in 2006 and 3994 million or 193 of total net revenues during 2005 slt product net revenue increased 805 million or 20 from 2005 to 2006 due to a growing demand and brand recognition for our slt products from large enterprises and the us federal government sales increased across various slt product families including firewalls idp jseries dx and ssl in addition the new products announced in 2006 and the dx and application acceleration products added to our portfolio through the various acquisitions in 2005 contributed to this increase in addition we experienced success in crossselling slt products to service providers for both their own it infrastructure and resale built upon the acquisitions we completed in 2005 a further part of the increase was due to successfully selling to much larger enterprise customers with increased footprint and complexity 

 

the following table shows slt revenue units recognized 

 

 

 

slt product units increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily attributable to the growing demand for our slt products in the market place the 30 increase in the number of slt units was greater than the revenue increase of 20 primarily due to the increased revenue from sales of our branch firewall products which have lower average selling price than other slt products slt product units increased 8 while slt product revenue increased 20 in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to sales of highend firewalls 

 

net service revenues 

 

net service revenues increased 988 million or 24 to 5091 million in 2007 compared to 2006 and represent 180 of net revenues the growth in service revenue was primarily driven by increased technical support service contracts associated with higher infrastructure and slt product sales which have resulted in increased renewals and a larger installed base of equipment being serviced installed base is calculated by each customer based on the number of systems that the customers has under maintenance a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into maintenance contracts that are generally for oneyear renewable periods we also have multiyear maintenance contracts these contracts are typically for services such as 24hour customer support nonspecified updates and hardware repairs we recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation in addition to support services and professional services we also provide educational services consistent with 2006 support service revenues represents 89 of net service revenues in 2007 to a lesser extent professional services also contributed to the growth in net service revenues in 2007 professional service revenue increased primarily due to large customer deployments requiring consulting services 

net service revenues increased 1173 million or 40 from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the growth in support services driven by an increase in the installed base that we are servicing as well as increased attach rates on new product sales improved enterprise service infrastructure allowing more rapid implementation of services and the addition of new professional service offerings professional service revenue also increased to a lesser extent in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to maintenancerelated onsite engineering services as well as additional consulting projects in 2006 

 

total net revenues by geographic region 

 

the following table shows total net revenues by geographic region in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

 

  

we continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic regions for the three years ended december 31 2007 and we expect this trend to continue 

 

net revenues in the americas region increased 3072 million or 30 to 13405 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 the americas region represented 473 of net revenues in 2007 an increase of 25 percentage points over 2006 the increases were largely due to strength in the united states and in latin america net revenue from the united states increased 2655 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to revenue growth in the infrastructure product segment from our service provider and internet content provider customers and to a lesser extent slt product and service segments net revenues from latin america increased 391 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to strength in brazil driven by sales to a major local carrier total 2006 revenue recorded by the americas region grew by 1004 million from its 2005 level and remained at approximately 45 of worldwide revenue as compared to 2005 due to significant success in the united states and with the main service providers in canada and various south american countries including brazil and argentina net revenue in the united states increased by 713 million in 2006 from 2005 due to continued success both with enterprise customers such as the us federal government as well as with major service providers in the united states the increase was also due in part to sales to major internet content providers and cable providers this success was partially offset by a significant product revenue deferral for products shipped to one of our largest customers net revenue in americas as a percentage of total net revenue decreased slightly in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of the strong growth in emea 

 

net revenue in the emea region increased 1006 million or 12 to 9180 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased infrastructure product and slt product revenues along with increased service revenue driven by strong bandwidth demands in the region revenue increased in belgium ireland united kingdom and france 

partially offset by a decrease in the netherlands as well as revenue growth in the emerging markets such as eastern europe and the middle east net revenue from emea as a percentage of net revenues decreased 31 percentage points to 324 in 2007 over 2006 primarily due to relative strength in the americas region revenue in the emea region grew by 2073 million or 34 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to significant success with ngn deployments across the region in particular sweden the netherlands france and germany as well as sales growth in emerging regions including russia eastern europe and the middle east as a result net revenue from emea as a percentage of net revenues increased 59 percentage points to 355 in 2006 over 2005 

 

net revenue in the asia pacific region increased 1247 million or 28 to 5776 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased revenue from infrastructure products slt products and service driven by demands from service providers as well as enterprise customers resulting from crossselling of our product portfolio we experienced revenue growth across the region with strength in korea australia malaysia india and indonesia revenue from the asia pacific region declined 681 million or 13 in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the impact of certain ngn project decision delays in japan driving revenue down year over year partially offset by increased demands in china 

 

nsn accounted for greater than 10 of our net product and service revenues for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we expect that our largest customers as well as key strategic partners will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues in 2008 

 

cost of revenues 

 

the following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin “gm” percentages in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

cost of product revenues 

 

product gross margin improved from 707 in 2006 to 709 in 2007 the slight increase in product gross margin was mainly due to favorable product mix and to a lesser extent improvements in standard costs of our infrastructure products partially offset by a slight decrease in our slt product gross margin the improvement of standard costs as a percentage of product revenue was primarily due to our increased purchases from contract manufacturers and suppliers in lower cost regions as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we employed 190 and 149 people respectively in our manufacturing and operations organization these personnel manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor product testing and quality 

 

infrastructure product gross margin percentages improved slightly in 2007 compared to 2006 our infrastructure chassis revenue units increased 10 while our infrastructure ports shipped increased 41 during 2007 on a yearoveryear basis compared to the infrastructure product revenues increase of 24 for the year we experienced a favorable product mix and derived a larger portion of revenues from richly configured highend mseries and tseries router products we also generated revenues from highmargin port shipments which are addon components to the chassis routers the increases in chassis units and port shipments were driven by bandwidth demand as customers are seeking to expand capabilities in their networks and to offer differentiating featurerich multiplay services that allow them to generate new revenue sources see further details in the “infrastructure product revenues” section 

the gross margin improvement from infrastructure products was offset by a slight decrease in our slt product gross margin in 2007 the decrease in slt product gross margin was primarily due to product mix particularly from an increase in the mix of lower margin branch firewall and jseries products in 2007 in addition higher manufacturing costs associated with newer and more complex products were also impacting slt gross margin the higher manufacturing costs were partially offset as we realized the benefit of our costreduction efforts of moving more manufacturing to lower cost regions see further details in the “slt product revenues” section 

 

cost of product revenues increased 488 million or 10 in 2006 as compared to 2005 the increase was primarily attributable to increased product revenue in both the enterprise and service provider markets net product gross margin of 707 for 2006 slightly decreased compared to 714 for 2005 primarily due to the impact of the mix of products and the mix of territories partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we employed 149 and 134 people respectively in our manufacturing and operations organization the increase in stock compensation expense in cost of product revenue from 2005 to 2006 of 09 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting fas 123r on january 1 2006 

 

product gross margins tend to fluctuate due to changes in the mix of products sold and our gross margins may be impacted as we introduce new products and manage production costs among multiple contract manufacturers or when our customers change the timing of their purchases we will continue to seek reductions in our production costs as we enter into new markets including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures our margins are impacted by changes in distribution channels and price competition as well as changes in the geographic mix of our sales sales discounts warranty costs changes in shipment volume loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing also impact gross margins these factors combined with how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans may lead to margin variability 

 

cost of service revenues 

 

cost of service revenues increased 522 million or 26 to 2514 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 service gross margin decreased by less than one percentage point to 506 in 2007 as compared to 2006 the increase in service costs and the decrease in gross margin were primarily attributable to increases in headcount related expenses associated with expanding our service delivery infrastructure and professional service organization particularly in north america and in india as well as increasing our resources for supporting network buildouts and deployments by our customers service related headcount increased by 137 employees or 22 to 748 employees in 2007 compared to 611 in 2006 employee salary and related expenses including stockbased compensation expense represented the majority of the increases in cost of service revenues in 2007 total employee salary and related expenses as a percentage of service revenues were approximately 25 for 2007 and 20 for 2006 outside service expense increased as we used outside providers to support the increase in customer support contracts and professional engagements freight related expense increased due to the deployment of spare parts in supporting our growth overseas facility and it expenses allocation to the cost of service revenues increased in 2007 which is consistent with other areas of our organization due to our headcount growth and investment in internal infrastructure to support our growing business partially offsetting the increases was a decrease in spares expense due to the large spares purchase we made in 2006 

 

cost of service revenues increased 520 million or 35 to 1992 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 the increase was a direct result of a larger installed base of products covered by service contracts however our service gross margin increased one percentage point from 2005 to 2006 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale which result in a better leveraged service organization total employee salary and related expenses as a percentage of service revenue were approximately 20 for 2006 and 20 for 2005 however in absolute dollars employee salary and related expenses increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an investment in new customer service personnel particularly to support our enterprise customers stock compensation expense in cost of service revenue also increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the impact of adopting fas 123r in 2006 in addition to personnel expenses outside services costs increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to contracting for engineers to provide professional services revenue particularly for the middle east and other emerging markets spares and freight costs increased from 2005 to 2006 due to a significant investment in spares around the world to support the increase in customer contracts particularly in the enterprise market finally the costs associated with facilities 

depreciation and other expenses allocated to cost of service revenue increased from 2005 to 2006 due to increases in revenue and investment in infrastructure to support the growing business

the following table highlights our operating expenses and operating income loss as a percentage of net revenues 

 

 

 

research and development expenses 

 

research and development expenses include 

 

  

several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 

 

research and development expense increased 1427 million or 30 and increased 12 percentage points of net revenues in 2007 over 2006 the increase was largely due to our commitment to continue innovation of our 

products in particular in 2007 we continued the development of our ethernet products including the mxseries and our new exseries ethernet switching products introduced in january 2008 as well as the development of our new t1600 product which was released in november 2007 personnel related expenses which comprise the majority of our research and development expenses increased primarily due to headcount growth and meritbased salary increases in 2007 research and development related headcount increased by 493 employees or 24 in 2007 to 2563 employees as of december 31 2007 headcount increase was primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization within the infrastructure segment in addition to personnel related expenses we also increased prototype and lab equipment expenses in 2007 for the development of our new products additionally our allocated facilities and information technology as well as depreciation expenses for our research and development organization increased in 2007 due to increases in headcount from additional internal systems to support our growth in general we grew our engineering organizations to support product innovation expand and improve our product portfolio and address growth opportunities in ngn bandwidth and features for our service provider and enterprise customers 

 

research and development expenses increased 1230 million or 35 percentage points of net revenues in 2006 over 2005 as a result of our focus on the development of a broader portfolio of networking products the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses depreciation facility related expenses engineering and testing expenses outside service expenses and equipment related expenses the increases in personnel related expenses in 2006 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization across the infrastructure and slt segments headcount increased 19 from 1736 individuals to 2070 individuals during 2006 the headcount increase was attributable to product innovation efforts in areas including router security and integration in order to capture potential future ngn infrastructure growth and other opportunities in the enterprise and the service provider markets to a lesser extent the increases in personnel expenses were attributable to meritbased salary increases beginning in april 2006 facility engineering and testing expense increased in 2006 to support our product innovation efforts outside service expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional consulting projects on developing future product roadmaps the increase in stock compensation expense in research and development expenses from 2005 to 2006 of 240 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting fas 123r in 2006 our investment and expansion on our global research and development efforts were primarily in china and india 

 

we plan to increase our investment in research and development during 2008 compared to 2007 to further advance our competitive advantage as a percentage of net revenues we anticipate our research and development spending will decrease slightly in 2008 

 

sales and marketing expenses 

 

sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services demonstration equipment and advertisements these costs vary quartertoquarter depending on revenues product launches and marketing initiatives we have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales we have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

sales and marketing expenses increased 1087 million or 19 to 6667 million and represented 235 of total net revenues in 2007 compared to 242 in 2006 as a percentage of net revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly in 2007 due to our focus on increasing our operating margin and the efficiency of our sales activities the increases in absolute dollars were primarily headcount related increases sales and marketing related headcount increased 272 employees or 17 in 2007 to 1863 as of december 31 2007 as we hired additional personnel across our infrastructure and slt organizations to support the larger product portfolio and to expand our presence in the enterprise marketplace in addition commission expenses increased primarily as a result of strong revenue growth in 2007 we also increased consulting expenses to support our sales and marketing initiatives likewise our need and expenses for demonstration equipment has grown as we seek to capture new markets and release new products as the sales and marketing organization grows we have also grown our information technology and facilities to these organizations accounting for the increases of related expense allocations in 2007 over 2006 

sales and marketing expenses increased 1164 million or 26 to 5580 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased as a percent of total net revenues the increases were primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses facility related expenses travel expenses marketing related activities and equipment related expenses personnel related expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional hires to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base as well as to support the larger portfolio of products in particular we expanded our enterprise sales force and targeted key growth areas such as china the middle east and india we added 171 individuals to our sales and marketing function during 2006 travel expense increased in 2006 due primarily to increased headcount and more activity in emerging markets marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our brand recognition support of our distribution channels introduction of new products targeted solution value propositions and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers equipment related expenses increased in 2006 due to the introduction of new products the increase in stock compensation expenses in sales and marketing from 2005 to 2006 of 245 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting fas 123r in 2006 

 

we plan to continue our investment in sales and marketing activities in both direct and channel sales as well as our service provider and enterprise focus we anticipate our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of net revenues in 2008 

 

general and administrative expenses 

 

general and administrative expenses include professional fees bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses professional fees include legal audit tax accounting and certain corporate strategic services 

 

general and administrative expenses increased 193 million or 20 and represented 41 of total net revenues in 2007 compared to 42 in 2006 as a percentage of net revenue general and administrative expenses slightly decreased in 2007 due to our focus on increasing our operating margin the increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses and outside professional services employee related expenses including salaries bonuses stockbased compensation and fringe benefits expenses increased in 2007 over 2006 as headcount increased by 56 employees or 24 in 2007 to 291 employees as of december 31 2007 the headcount increases were primarily in the finance and human resources organizations as we expanded our organization infrastructure in lower cost regions improved internal processes and continued our initiatives to update our information systems outside services increased 45 million in 2007 compared to 2006 as we invested in designing a more efficient organizational structure and improving our internal systems such increases were offset by the decreases in accounting and legal fees of 15 million for 2007 compared to 2006 consistent with other areas of our organization facilities and information technology allocations increased in order to support these initiatives and the growth of our business 

 

general and administrative expenses increased 221 million or 29 in 2006 compared to 2005 as a percentage of net revenues general and administrative expenses increased slightly from 36 in 2005 to 42 in 2006 the increases were driven by increases in personnel related expenses and other related expenses general and administrative worldwide headcount increased 11 or 24 individuals during 2006 to support the overall growth in the business bad debt expense increased in 2006 primarily due to a bad debt expense benefit in 2005 facility and it related allocation expense increased as a result of our personnel growth and development of our systems infrastructure the increase of general and administrative related stock compensation expense from 2005 to 2006 of 118 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting fas 123r in 2006 

 

we anticipate our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of net revenues in 2008 

 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

 

amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased 59 million due to purchased intangible assets reaching the end of the amortization period during 2007 as compared to 2006 amortization of purchased intangible assets increased 66 million in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of recognizing a full year of amortization associated with the five acquisitions completed in 2005 see note 3 in item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets 

impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

 

we had no impairment against our goodwill or intangible assets in 2007 impairment charges increased by 12775 million in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of the impairment of both goodwill and purchased intangible assets during 2006 due primarily to the decline in the company’s market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to the impairment review and to a lesser extent to a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill and reduced the goodwill within the slt segment by 12800 million in addition we recorded a 34 million impairment expense pertaining to a writedown of intangible assets as a result of a decrease in forecasted revenue for the sbc standalone products during the second quarter of 2006 in 2005 we wrote down 59 million of purchased intangible assets acquired from kagoor networks inc “kagoor” see note 3 in item 8 for more information on our impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

 

inprocess research and development 

 

we had no inprocess research and development “iprd” charges in 2007 and 2006 in 2005 a total of 110 million was charged to iprd expense in connection with three of our five acquisitions during the year of the total funk purchase price 53 million was allocated to iprd of the total peribit purchase price 38 million was allocated to iprd of the total kagoor purchase price 19 million was allocated to iprd none of the acorn packet solutions inc “acorn” or redline networks inc “redline” purchase prices were allocated to iprd 

 

projects that qualify as iprd represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a betaphase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development at the time of acquisition funk peribit and kagoor had multiple iprd efforts under way for certain current and future product lines

interest and other income interest and other expense gain on minority equity investment and income tax provision 

 

the following table highlights other income other expenses and income tax provision for the indicated periods in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

interest and other income net 

 

net interest and other income decreased 39 million or 4 in 2007 compared to 2006 this decrease was due to decreases in interest income resulting from a lower cash cash equivalents and investment balance attributable to our funding of our repurchase of approximately 16 billion of our common stock during the first and second quarters of 2007 partially offsetting the decreases was the higher interest yield combined with a higher average cash cash equivalents and investment balances particularly in the beginning of 2007 primarily due to higher positive cash flows from operations compared to 2006 interest and other expenses slightly increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to costs associated with our distributor financing program other interest and expenses include shortterm debt expenses debt issuance cost amortization foreign exchange losses and other expenses such as bank fees 

 

net interest and other income increased 455 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 458 million increase in interest income from 2005 to 2006 as a result of higher cash cash equivalents and investment balances and an increase in rates of return realized from our investments throughout 2006 also interest and other expense decreased 03 million from 2005 and 2006 primarily due to lower portfolio management fees 

gain on and writedown of investments net 

 

in june 2007 one of the companies in which we had a minority equity investment completed an initial public offering “ipo” as a result we realized a gain of 67 million during 2007 based upon the difference between the market value of our investment at the time of the ipo and our cost basis during 2006 none of our investments had any gain or loss in 2005 we recorded a gain of 17 million in connection with a business combination transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio our cost basis of this equity investment was 10 million we have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost adjusted for any impairment as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies in addition during 2005 we wrotedown these investments by 04 million for changes in market value that we believed were otherthantemporary 

 

income tax provision 

 

provision for income taxes increased to 1498 million in 2007 from 1044 million in 2006 the 2007 effective rate was 293 and differs from the federal statutory rate of 350 primarily due to the benefit of income in foreign jurisdictions which is subject to lower rates and research and development credits in the united states 

 

provision for income taxes decreased to 1044 million in 2006 from 1468 million in 2005 the 2006 effective rate was 116 and differs from the federal statutory rate of 350 primarily due to the inability to benefit from a substantial portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2006 the 2005 effective rate was 295 and differs from the federal statutory rate of 350 due primarily to the benefit of tax credits income in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the repatriation in 2005 of 2250 million under the american jobs creation act of 2004 

 

the gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by approximately 95 million for 2007 of which 84 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate interest and penalties accrued for the same period were approximately 17 million 

 

it is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months due to audit examinations however an estimate of the range of possible change cannot be made at this time due to the high uncertainty of the resolution of andor closure on open audits 

 

we are currently under examination by the irs for the 2004 tax year and by the german tax authorities for the 2005 tax year additionally we have not reached a final resolution with the irs on an adjustment it proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax years we are not under examination by any other major jurisdictions in which the company files its income tax returns as of december 31 2007 it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months however an estimate of the range of possible change cannot be made at this time we have provided for uncertain tax positions that require a fin 48 liability 

 

additional details related to our income tax provision can be found in note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

segment information 

 

a description of the products and services for each segment can be found in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements we began to track financial information by our three segments in 2005 as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the business based on management operating income loss a description of the measures included in management operating income loss can also be found in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements we have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 for comparative purposes 

financial information for each segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows in millions except percentages

the following table shows financial information for each segment as a percentage of total net revenues 

 

 

 

infrastructure operating segment 

 

an analysis of the change in revenue for the infrastructure segment and the change in units can be found above in the section titled “net revenues” 

 

infrastructure management operating income increased 746 million or 18 from 2006 to 4955 million in 2007 due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth our increase in revenue was partially offset by our continued investments in research and development efforts as we seek to continue our innovation of products and expand our infrastructure product portfolio we also allocate sales and marketing general and administrative as well as facility and information technology expenses to the infrastructure segment generally based on headcount and revenue in 2007 our sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues but increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers we will continue to make these investments to expand our product features and functionality based upon the trends in the market place 

 

infrastructure management operating income decreased 683 million or 14 from 2005 to 4209 million in 2006 primarily due to higher personnel related costs associated with our investments in product innovation for next generation core and edge infrastructure products as well as increased operating expenses associated with marketing related efforts and improvements to our internal infrastructure partially offset by savings in sales expense during 2006 as we increasingly leveraged our existing distribution channel 

 

slt operating segment 

 

an analysis of the change in revenue for the slt segment and the change in units can be found in the section titled “net revenues” 

slt management operating loss increased 70 million or 62 from 2006 to 183 million in 2007 due to product mix and increases in manufacturing related costs the loss was primarily due to our effort to build a foundation to help enable future slt revenue growth and due to slight decreases in the slt product gross margins the increase in slt operating expenses was due in large part to our increased allocated expenses to the slt segment from both information technology investments and the higher variable compensation expenses associated with companywide revenue growth additionally we strategically invested in our research and development efforts to develop technologies and products for the junos platform in an effort to control costs we have moved a significant portion of the slt development organization to lower cost regions while expanding our product portfolio slt management operating loss was also impacted by continued investments in our sales and distribution channels we allocate sales and marketing general and administrative as well as facility and information technology expenses to the slt segment generally based on revenue and headcount in the third quarter of 2007 we increased our allocation of such expenses to the slt segment compared to the same period in 2006 primarily due to information technology investments and the higher variable compensation expenses associated with companywide revenue increases slt gross margin decreased slightly in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to higher manufacturing costs associated with newer and more complex products such higher manufacturing costs were partially offset as we realized the benefit of our costreduction efforts of moving more manufacturing to lower cost regions the increases in slt operating expenses were partially offset by our revenue growth especially in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to customers’ demands for security products particularly firewall and due to typical quarterly seasonality we generally experienced quarterly seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our slt products particularly in the fourth quarter which may result in greater variations in our quarterly operating results 

 

the slt segment incurred a management operating loss of 113 million in 2006 compared to the management operating income of 104 million in 2005 due primarily to higher product and personnel related costs partially offset by higher slt net revenues and gross margin increases in personnel related costs were primarily related to headcount growth in order to support product innovation new products sales and a larger customer base we made a strategic decision to invest more into the enterprise and slt markets to drive increased revenues and slt productivity in the future 

 

service operating segment 

 

an analysis of the change in revenue for the service segment can be found above in the section titled “net revenue” 

 

service management operating income increased 249 million or 25 from 2006 to 1264 million in 2007 by achieving economies of scale and cost control initiatives revenue growth surpassed cost of service expense growth in 2007 primarily due to our growth in installed base of equipment being serviced we also increased our service offerings and customer service infrastructure our service gross margin slightly decreased from 2006 to 2007 as we increased our headcount to build our global customer service and professional service organizations we expanded our customer service center in both north america and india as well as increased our resources for supporting network buildouts and deployments by our customers service management operating income was also impacted by sales and marketing general and administrative expenses as well as facilities and information systems management allocations to the service segment 

 

service gross margin percentages as well as service management operating income increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to improved economies of scale achieved by faster revenue growth through the infrastructure products and the slt products relative to the increases in operating costs in absolute dollars employee related expenses increased in 2006 as a result of increased service related headcount from 476 to 611 individuals expenses associated with spare components also increased in 2006 to support increased demands driven by additional service contracts as a result of our growing installed base 

 

stockbased compensation and related payroll taxes 

 

stockbased compensation expense increased by 04 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to new stock options and rsu grants partially offset by the lower stock option expense in 2007 as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and “outofthemoney” stock options 

completed in december 2005 “2005 stock option vesting acceleration” stockbased compensation related payroll tax expense increased 50 million in 2007 these expenses represent employment taxes we incurred in connection with our employee stock programs changes in such expenses are primarily attributable to the timing of the stock options exercises by our employees we experienced a considerable increase in these expenses due to the increase in our share price occurring in 2007 in contrast we had restrictions on stock option exercises during 2006 

 

stockbased compensation expense increased by 653 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the adoption of fas 123r stockbased compensation related payroll tax expense decreased 02 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to restrictions on stock option exercises in 2006 as a result of our delayed periodic filings with the sec 

 

inprocess research and development 

 

there were no iprd charges in 2007 and 2006 we recognized iprd charges of 110 million 2005 in connection with the acquisitions completed during the year 

 

restructuring charges in cost of product revenues 

 

there was no restructuring charges included in cost of product revenues during 2007 and 2005 we recognized restructuring charges in cost of product revenues of 14 million for 2006 in connection with the restructuring plan implemented during the year

working capital decreased 5839 million from december 31 2006 to december 31 2007 primarily due to the decrease in cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investments balance in the first and second quarters of 2007 our total cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investments decreased by 5985 million during 2007 primarily due to stock repurchases under the 2006 stock repurchase program discussed below additionally because the debt related to our outstanding zerocoupon convertible notes is due within one year we reclassified 3995 million of debt underlying such notes from longterm to shortterm liabilities and as a result further reduced our working capital in 2007 we generated 7865 million of cash from operations and 5718 million from our investing activities in addition we received financing cash flows of 3550 million from common stock issued to our employees through stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases in 2007 we repurchased 694 million shares of our common stock for 16232 million at an average purchase price of 2337 per share as of december 31 2007 our 2006 stock repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of 3768 million we may repurchase additional shares opportunistically under this program subject to a review of circumstances at the time see note 15 in item 8 for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2008 

 

in june 2007 we entered into a senior secured margin lending agreement with a thirdparty financial institution for a maximum credit facility of 4000 million or 90 of the fair market value of the underlying collateral to establish a flexible draw down facility to fund additional stock repurchases as necessary this credit facility bore a floating interest rate equal to the threemonth usd libor plus 40 basis points per annum and if utilized would be secured by our publicly traded fixed income securities portfolio equivalent to 111 of any outstanding balance this credit facility was terminated on september 26 2007 we did not utilize this credit facility at any time 

 

net accounts receivable increased 1303 million or 52 to 3798 million from december 31 2006 to december 31 2007 primarily due to an increase in revenue and shipment linearity dso was 42 days as of december 31 2007 as compared to 38 days as of december 31 2006 the increase in dso was primarily a result of shipment linearity and the mix of customers we shipped to in the fourth quarter of 2007 shipment linearity represents the rate at which products are shipped during a period our distributor financing program had minimal impact on dso during 2007 approximately 100 million of receivables sold under the distributor financing program had not been recognized in net revenues as of december 31 2007 and therefore such amounts were recorded as debt financing in other accrued liabilities 

 

deferred revenue increased 1277 million or 33 to 5133 million as of december 31 2007 as compared to december 31 2006 product and service deferred revenue increased 432 million and 845 million respectively in 2007 our product deferred revenue increased due to increases in the amount of product shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria and service deferred revenue increased due to an increase in the installed base of equipment under service contract 

liquidity and capital resources may also be impacted by acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the networking equipment and information security markets if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our 2006 stock repurchase program our liquidity may be impacted additionally a portion of our cash and investment balance is held overseas and may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 

 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments together with cash generated from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations repayment of outstanding debt and growth we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures commitments repurchases of our common stock and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months 

 

however our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors including 

 

  

cash requirements and contractual obligations 

 

our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations outstanding under the zero coupon convertible senior notes due june 15 2008 “senior notes” operating leases purchase commitments tax liabilities and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31 

2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions

investing activities 

 

net cash provided by investing activities was 5718 million and 119 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively net cash used in investing activities was 5837 million for 2005 investing activities primarily included the purchases and sale or maturities of availableforsale securities the purchase and sale of equity investments net cash used in acquisitions and capital expenditures 

 

net sales and maturities of investments in availableforsale securities were 10291 million in 2007 compared to net sales and maturities of 6321 million for 2006 as we used cash to fund our stock repurchase program described under the financing activities section below purchases of availableforsale securities used 2986 million in 2007 compared to 5161 million in 2006 primarily due to the funding of our stock repurchase program and our investment strategy during 2007 positive net cash flows of 1159 million generated from the sales maturities and purchases of availableforsale securities in 2006 was primarily due to the increased cash and cash equivalent holdings as a result of higher shortterm interest rates purchases and sales or maturities of availableforsale securities used net cash of 1310 million in 2005 

 

capital expenditures increased 448 million to 1469 million in 2007 and 39 million to 1021 million in 2006 mainly to support new product developments and overseas expansions capital expenditures of 982 million in 2005 mainly used in support of new product developments overseas expansions and business acquisitions cash flows related to restricted cash decreased by 279 million from a cash inflow of 205 million in 2006 to a cash outflow of 74 million in 2007 primarily due to the funding to the do insurance trust to increase coverage due to the growth of our company in 2005 we used cash of 3099 million for the 2005 acquisitions 348 million for restricted cash funding to escrow accounts in relation to the 2005 acquisitions and 98 million for minority equity investment 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 12385 million and 896 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2007 we repurchased 694 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 2337 per share or a total of 16232 million in 2006 we repurchased 101 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 1851 per share or a total of 1864 million in addition cash was provided during both periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans for a total of 3550 million and 871 million during 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2007 and 2006 tax benefits of 197 million and 97 million respectively from tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options was presented as financing cash flows due to the adoption of fas 123r beginning on january 1 2006 tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options were included in operating cash flows in 2005 before the adoption of fas 123r approximately 100 million of receivables sold under our distributor financing program had not been recognized as revenue as of december 31 2007 and therefore such amounts were recorded as net borrowings under cash flows from financing activities 

 

net cash provided by financing activities was 1460 million in 2005 primarily due to common stock issued in relation to employee option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities in addition a portion of our cash and marketable securities are held in nonus domiciled countries these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 

 

the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december 31 2007 and 2006 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points bps 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

 

foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

 

periodically we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months 

 

our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound the euro indian rupee and japanese yen periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates we record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations the increase in operating expenses including research and development sales and marketing as well as general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging was approximately 2 in 2007 

equity price risk 

 

our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities is inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates we monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis in the event that the carrying value of the equity investments exceeds its fair value and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value we do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes the aggregate fair value of our marketable equity securities was 86 million and 08 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively a hypothetical 30 adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of publiclytraded equity securities would result in an immaterial loss 

 

in addition to publiclytraded securities we have also invested in privatelyheld companies these investments are carried at cost the aggregate cost of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 233 million and 204 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of our ceo and cfo which are required in accordance with rule 13a14 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended this “controls and procedures” section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented 

 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the ceo and cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended based upon that evaluation the ceo and cfo concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that material information relating to our consolidated operations is made known to our management including the ceo and cfo particularly during the period when our periodic reports are being prepared 

 

changes in internal controls 

 

in 2007 we initiated a multiyear implementation to upgrade certain key internal it systems including our companywide human resources management system customer relationship management “crm” system and our enterprise resource planning “erp” system this project is the result of our normal business process to evaluate and upgrade or replace our systems software and related business processes to support our evolving operational needs there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our control system’s objective will be met and our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to risks over time 

controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

 item 1 business 

overview 

we design and sell products and services that together provide our customers with secure and assured internet protocol “ip” networking solutions our solutions are incorporated into the global web of interconnected public and private networks across which a variety of media including voice video and data travel to and from end users around the world our network infrastructure solutions enable service providers and other networkintensive businesses to support and deliver services and applications on a highly efficient and low cost integrated network 

in 2004 we completed the acquisition of netscreen technologies inc “netscreen” and in 2005 we completed the following five acquisitions kagoor networks inc “kagoor” redline networks inc “redline” peribit networks inc “peribit” acorn packet solutions inc “acorn” and funk software inc “funk” as a result of the these acquisitions we expanded our customer base and portfolio of products and now offer two categories of networking products infrastructure products which consist predominately of the original juniper networks router portfolio and acorn products and service layer technologies “slt” products which consist predominately of the former funk peribit redline kagoor and netscreen products 

during 2005 our operations were organized into the following three operating segments infrastructure slt and service our infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable router products that are used to control and direct network traffic our slt segment offers solutions that meet a broad array of our customer’s priorities from protecting the network itself and protecting data on the network to maximizing existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications across a distributed network together our secure networking solutions help enable our customers to convert networks that provide commoditized best efforts services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation and value and increased reliability and security to end users our service segment delivers worldwide services to customers of the infrastructure and slt segments subsequent to 2005 we realigned our product groups and will report kagoor products in the infrastructure segment beginning in 2006 

during our fiscal year ended december 31 2005 we generated net revenues of 206 billion and conducted business in approximately 75 countries see the information in item 8 for more information on our consolidated financial position as of december 31 2005 and 2004 and our consolidated results of operations consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2005 

we were incorporated in california in 1996 and reincorporated in delaware in 1997 our corporate headquarters is located in sunnyvale california our website address is wwwjunipernet 

our strategy 

our objective and strategy is to provide bestinclass traffic processing technologies that allow our customers to provide a secure and assured network experience for any application on an ip network our technological leadership and problem solving abilities combined with our experience and fundamental understanding of the requirements of high performance ip secure networking solutions will help us in meeting our objectives key elements of our strategy are described below 

  maintain and extend technology leadership  our applicationspecific integrated circuit asic technology operating system and networkoptimized product architecture have been key elements to establishing our technology leadership we believe that these elements can be leveraged into future products we are currently developing we intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the network infrastructure and security markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in our research and development departments supplemented by external partnerships including strategic alliances as well as acquisitions that would allow us to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets 

  leverage position as supplier of purposebuilt network infrastructure and security  from inception we have focused on designing and building ip network infrastructure for service providers and network intensive 

businesses and have integrated purposebuilt technology into a network optimized architecture that specifically meets our customers’ needs we believe that many of these customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors we believe that the purposebuilt nature of our products provide us with a competitive advantage which is critical in gaining rapid penetration as one of these selected vendors 

  be strategic to our customers  in developing our infrastructure and slt solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build a product specifically to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the challenges facing these customers that increased understanding has enabled us to subsequently design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date we plan to continue to work very closely with our customers to implement enhancements to current products as well as to design future products that specifically meet their evolving needs 

  enable new ipbased services  our platforms enable network operators to build and secure networks costeffectively and to offer new differentiated services for their customers more efficiently than legacy network products we believe that the secure delivery of ipbased services and applications including web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services outsourced enterprise applications and voiceover ip will continue to grow and are costeffectively enabled by our secure networking solutions 

  establish and develop industry partnerships  our customers have diverse requirements while our products meet certain requirements of our customers our products are not intended to satisfy certain other requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we build relationships with other industry leaders in a diverse set of networking technologies and services these relationships ensure that we have access to those technologies and services whether through joint development resale acquisition or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers’ requirements 

markets and customers 

we sell our products and services through direct sales and through distributors and valueadded resellers to endusers in the following markets 

  service providers 

service providers include wireline wireless cable and nextgeneration network operators supporting most major service provider networks in the world our platforms are designed and built for the scale and dependability that service providers demand our secure networking solutions benefit these customers by 

 

  enterprise 

our secure networking solutions are designed to meet the reliability and scalability demanded by the world’s largest and most advanced networks for this reason network intensive enterprises federal state and local governments and research and education institutions that rely on their networks for the operation of their business are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications while 

 

 

fundamental requirements for high performance secure networks 

as they work to support growth in ip traffic and seek to offer new revenuegenerating or missioncritical services our customers require secure network solutions that are not only feature rich but also deliver high reliability high performance and assured user experiences 

at the same time both service providers and enterprises must focus on detecting and preventing the ever increasing number of security threats facing the network itself and the data that flows across the network this security must be innate to networking products and must not come at the expense of overall performance or unjustifiable cost 

feature richness high reliability security high performance scalability and cost effectiveness are each fundamental requirements in meeting the needs associated with the growth in ip traffic and the secure and assured delivery of valueadded services to end users 

  feature richness the importance of increasing revenue streams and decreasing capital and operational costs for our customers is a significant priority in the industry service providers want to sell more revenue generating services with better cost efficiencies enterprises and other network operators want to provide a secure and assured network experience to their end users on a cost effective but valuegenerating basis each of these goals is ultimately a function of the features and capabilities that can be securely provided on each of the network elements as networks advance more and more features are required to sell new services as well as to lower the ongoing costs of operating the network next generation networking solutions therefore need to have flexibility to add new capabilities frequently without compromising the performance of the system which gets increasingly difficult as the network demands increase 

  high reliability  as businesses and consumers increasingly rely on ip networks for missioncritical applications high network reliability is essential as a result those businesses and consumers expect service providers to deliver a high degree of reliability in their networks 

  security  today’s network environment presents an everincreasing number of challenges regarding network security ranging from simple denial of service attacks to sophisticated pervasive and malicious intrusions the importance of security is increasing within all of our customers and we are continually improving and evolving the security capabilities on all of our product solutions it is extremely important to provide comprehensive networkbased security services that are fully integrated free of performance tradeoffs and scaleable to any customer or market 

  high performance without compromising intelligence  to handle the rapid growth in ip traffic today’s network operators increasingly require secure networking solutions that can operate at higher speeds while still delivering realtime services such as security and qualityofservice features the processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated forwarding technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination based on priority data type and other considerations since a large number of ip packets many of which perform critical administrative functions are small in size high performance ip routers need to achieve their specified transmission speeds even for small packet sizes since smaller packets increase packet processing demands routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be more resource intensive than routing of larger packets a wire speed router which achieves its specified transmission rate for any type of traffic passing through it can accomplish this task thus provisioning of missioncritical services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed processing 

  high performance under stressful conditions  in a large and complex network individual components inevitably fail however the failure of an individual device or link must not compromise the network as a whole in a typical network when a failure occurs the network loses some degree of capacity and in turn a greater load falls on the remaining network routers which must provide alternate routes ip infrastructure must quickly adjust to the new state of the network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping significant numbers of packets when active routes are lost or when large numbers of routes change routing protocols are used to accomplish this convergence a process that places even greater stress on the router given the complexity of ip network 

infrastructure the convergence process is complex and places a far greater load on the router thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device 

  scalability  due to the rapid growth in ip traffic service providers must continuously expand their networks both in terms of increased numbers of access points of presence pops and also greater capacity per pop to facilitate this expansion process secure networking solutions must be highly scalable next generation network appliances therefore need to be flexible and configurable to function within constantly changing networks while incurring minimal downtime 

  high return on investment  continued growth in ip traffic price competition in the telecommunications market and increasing pressure for network operators to attain higher returns on their network infrastructure investments all contribute to our customers’ desire for solutions that significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build and operate their networks in addition to the basic cost of equipment network operators incur substantial ancillary costs for the space required to deploy the equipment power consumed and ongoing operation and maintenance of the equipment network operators therefore want to deploy dense and varied equipment configurations in limited amounts of rack and floor space therefore in order to continue to scale their networks toward higher data speeds in a cost effective manner network operators need the ability to mix and match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities without significantly increasing the consumption of space or power and driving costs higher 

these requirements define a clear need for ip infrastructure and security solutions that can support high speeds and offer new ipbased services at the same time network operators are eagerly seeking new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within their networks and reduce the cost of their architectures 

our technology and products 

early in our history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific high performance needs of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created our infrastructure products are designed to address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless access by combining highperformance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a networkoptimized solution 

with the acquisition of netscreen we added a broad family of network security solutions that deliver high performance costeffective security for enterprises service providers and government entities including firewall and virtual private network “vpn” systems and appliances secure sockets layer “ssl” vpn appliances and intrusion detection and prevention “idp” appliances with the acquisitions of funk peribit redline and kagoor we added complementary products and technologies to our slt product family that enable our customers to provide additional ipbased services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and applications 

our infrastructure products offer a full suite of scalable tested routing protocols which are used to control and direct network traffic and are critical to a network routing solution this control is made more important by the fact that the size and complexity of ip networks are increasing at a time when service providers are looking to differentiate themselves through valueadded service offerings our firewall and vpn systems are standardsbased for easy integration into customer networks and deliver integrated firewall vpn and denial of service protection capabilities in a single device our idp appliances incorporate multiple methods of detection such as attack pattern matching protocol anomaly detection and backdoor detection and stop attacks based on known patterns of attack suspicious traffic or connection requests 

  infrastructure products 

we believe that an overview of the physical nature of our infrastructure products is helpful in understanding the operation of our business 

although specific designs vary among our product families our platforms are essentially modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform the chassis contains components that enable and support many of the fundamental functions of the router such as power supplies cooling fans and components that run our junos or junose operating system perform highspeed packet forwarding or keep track of the structure of the network and instruct the packet forwarding components where to send packets each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 

the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from the network over a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module in some cases modules do not contain ports or physically receive packets from the network but rather enhance the overall functionality of the router we refer to these components as service modules 

major infrastructure product families are summarized as follows 

 

  service layer technologies products 

slt products provide network security solutions and enable our customers to provide additional ipbased services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and applications 

major slt product families are summarized as follows

sales and marketing 

as of december 31 2005 we employed 1419 employees in our worldwide sales and marketing organizations these sales employees operate within their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships information concerning our revenues by significant customers and by geographic region can be found in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form 10k 

  direct sales structure 

our direct sales organization is organized into three geographic theaters and within each theater according to the particular needs in that market our three geographic theaters are i the americas ii europe middle east and africa and iii asia pacific our direct relationships with our customers are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgement of those orders or by purchase contracts in instances where we have contracts with our customer those contracts set forth only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products 

  global channel system 

in our sales and marketing efforts we also employ a global network of strategic distribution relationships as well as theater or countryspecific distributors and value added resellers valueadded resellers include our strategic resellers which resell our products to endusers around the world within each theater in addition to our direct sales force we employ sales professionals to assist with the management of our various sales channels 

we have strategic reseller relationships with ericsson lucent technologies and siemens we believe that each of these companies have significant customer relationships in place and offer products that complement our product offerings our arrangements with each of these partners allow them to resell our products on a worldwide nonexclusive basis provide for discounts based upon the volume of products sold and specify other general terms of sale the agreements do not require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products siemens accounted for greater than 10 of our total net revenues in 2005 

in addition to these strategic reseller relationships we maintain relationships with distributors and valueadded resellers in various theaters these distributors and valueadded resellers tend to be focused on particular theaters or particular countries within theaters for example we have substantial distribution relationships with ingram micro in the americas and with nec in japan the valueadded resellers have expertise in deploying complex networking solutions in their respective markets our agreements with these distributors and valueadded resellers are generally nonexclusive limited by theater and provide product discounts and other ordinary terms of sale these agreements do not require our distributors or valueadded resellers to purchase specified quantities of our products 

customer service and support 

as of december 31 2005 we employed 476 people in our worldwide customer service and support organization we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services in most cases our customer service and support organization provides front line product support and is the problem resolution interface to our partners and direct end users we offer the following services 24x7x365 technical assistance hardware repair and replacement unspecified updates professional services and educational services we deliver these services directly to major end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and third party organizations we also train our channel partners in the delivery of education and support services 

research and development 

as of december 31 2005 we employed 1736 people in our worldwide research and development organization we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design security routing protocols and embedded operating systems these individuals have worked in leading computer data networking and telecommunications companies in addition to building complex hardware and operating systems the engineering team has experience in delivering highly integrated asics and scalable technology 

we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings in our infrastructure and slt products we are leveraging our asic technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customer applications and continuing to develop next generation technology to support the anticipated growth in ip network requirements we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface 

our research and development process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects this process involves all functional groups and all levels following an assessment of market demand our research and development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market 

manufacturing and operations 

as of december 31 2005 we employed 134 employees in manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor and manage product testing and quality we currently have manufacturing relationships primarily with celestica and plexus under which we have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity this subcontracting activity extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs together with our contract manufacturers we design specify and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits 

 

our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on rolling forecasts from us about our product demands each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and test the products according to our specifications products are then shipped directly to our distributors valueadded resellers or endusers we generally do not own the components and title to the products transfers from 

the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment in certain circumstances we may be liable to our contract manufacturers for carrying and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on our forecasts 

although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis 

our asics are manufactured primarily by sole sources such as ibm and toshiba each of whom is responsible for all aspects of the production of the asics using our proprietary designs 

backlog 

we believe that backlog information is not relevant to an understanding of our overall business as our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products and industry practice allows customers to cancel or change orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment 

competition 

competition in the network infrastructure and security markets is intense cisco systems has historically dominated the market with other companies such as nortel networks alcatel checkpoint software technologies and huawei technologies providing competitive products in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers 

we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as cisco nortel alcatel and huawei technologies will introduce new products which are designed to compete more effectively in this market as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot guarantee that we will be successful 

many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco nortel alcatel and huawei technologies have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products also many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged increased competition could result in price reduction fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could seriously harm our operating results 

there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products consolidation in this industry has begun with one or more of these smaller private companies being acquired by large established suppliers of network infrastructure products and we believe it is likely to continue as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have 

several companies also provide solutions that can substitute for some uses of routers for example high bandwidth asynchronous transfer mode “atm” switches are used in the core of certain major backbone service providers atm switches can carry a variety of traffic types including voice video and data using fixed 53 byte cells companies that use atm switches are enhancing their products with new software technologies such as multiprotocol label switching “mpls” which can potentially simplify the task of mixing routers and switches in the same network these substitutes can reduce the need for large numbers of routers 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and knowhow our engineering teams have significant expertise in asic design and we own all rights to the design of the asics which form the core of many of our products our operating systems were developed internally and are protected by united states and other copyright laws 

while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

in addition we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements there can be no assurance that thirdparty licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed or that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or those other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we had 4145 fulltime employees 379 of whom were in general and administrative functions we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good competition for personnel in our industry is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire motivate and retain qualified personnel we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future in addition recently adopted accounting rules will require us to begin treating certain equity incentives traditionally given to employees as a compensation expense by causing us to record significantly increased compensation costs such accounting changes will reduce our reported earnings and will require us to reduce the availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees which may make it more difficult for us to attract retain and motivate key personnel and we anticipate that we will experience higher voluntary employee turnover than we have historically 

our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies involve significant risks the market price of our stock reflects a higher multiple of expected future earnings than many other companies accordingly even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results changes in the mix of the products and services sold acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our stock price 

  fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results 

our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on network expansion have previously resulted for example in 2001 and 2002 and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings and could also negatively impact our ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer relationships economic downturns may also lead to restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the shortterm uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future economic weakness customer financial difficulties and reductions in spending on network expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our results of operations and stock price 

  our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

the factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include but are not limited to limited visibility into customer spending plans changes in the mix of products sold changing market conditions including current and potential customer consolidation competition customer concentration long sales and implementation cycles regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the first and third quarters 

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below one or more of the expectations of securities analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

  we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the demand for network and ip systems does not continue to grow then our business operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth of ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy and capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 

a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners siemens accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 and ericsson accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during the year ended december 31 2003 this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results any downturn in the business of our key customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease 

sales to such customers which could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations in addition there has been and continues to be consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example the acquisitions of att and mci this consolidation may cause our customers who are involved in these acquisitions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or have other unforeseen consequences 

  we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial results 

competition is intense in the markets that we address the ip infrastructure market has historically been dominated by cisco systems inc with other companies such as alcatel sa nortel networks corporation and huawei technologies providing products to a smaller segment of the market in addition a number of other small public or private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address 

in the service layer technologies market we face intense competition from a broader group of companies including appliance vendors such as cisco systems inc and software vendors such as checkpoint software technologies in addition a number of other small public or private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address 

if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 

a customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy in particular customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large or nextgeneration networks may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customer’s network environment and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 

  we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 

with the current demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed we currently purchase numerous key components including applicationspecific integrated circuits asics from single or limited sources the development of alternate sources for those components is time consuming difficult and costly in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if as a result we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers which would seriously impact present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business 

in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 

  if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 

we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers if we overestimate our requirements the contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time if we underestimate our requirements the contract manufacturers may have inadequate time or materials and components required to produce our products which could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues 

  we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 

we depend primarily on independent contract manufacturers each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management each of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  integration of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business in 2005 we completed the acquisitions of funk acorn peribit redline and kagoor acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we have acquired has been and will continue to be a complex time consuming and expensive process for example although we completed the acquisition of netscreen in april 2004 integration of the products operations and personnel is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership of our current stockholders assume liabilities record goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition 

in addition if we fail in our integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  we rely on valueadded resellers and distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded reseller and distribution partners the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell competitors’ products our revenues depend in part on the performance of 

these partners the loss of or reduction in sales to our valueadded resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues our competitors may in some cases be effective in incentivizing current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to maintain relationships with our partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or motivate existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer 

in addition we recognize a portion of our revenue based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support it and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 

  we expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our product gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter and the recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including product mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete increases in material or labor costs excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product demand warranty related issues or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 

  recent rulemaking by the financial accounting standards board will require us to expense equity compensation given to our employees and will significantly harm our operating results and may reduce our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees 

we historically have used stock options as a significant component of our employee compensation program in order to align employees’ interests with the interests of our stockholders encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation packages the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes that will require companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives we adopted this standard effective january 1 2006 by causing us to record significantly increased compensation costs such accounting changes will reduce our reported earnings and will require us to reduce the availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees which may make it more difficult for us to attract retain and motivate key personnel each of these results could materially and adversely affect our business 

  our reported financial results could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 

we are required to annually test and review on an interim basis our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any future acquisitions to determine if impairment has occurred if such assets are deemed impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized this would result in incremental expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred for example such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock falls below certain levels or if the portions of our business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at expected rates or decline we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets 

  our ability to process orders and ship product is dependent in part on our business systems and upon interfaces with the systems of third parties such as our suppliers or other partners if our systems the systems of those third parties or the interfaces between them fail our business processes could be impacted and our financial results could be harmed 

some of our business processes depend upon our information technology systems and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business and our financial results could be harmed 

  our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors our business could be adversely affected and we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 

our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by end customers any errors or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention in addition if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition could be harmed 

  a breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products which could cause us to lose revenues 

if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of our security products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed this could cause us to lose current and potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential valueadded resellers and distributors because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 

  if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs or if those products do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 

we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner if we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business and financial results even if we are able to anticipate develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 

our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products will be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks demand for our products could be adversely affected orders for our products could be cancelled or our products could be returned this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 

  litigation or claims regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming expensive and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing 

third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products for example in 2003 toshiba corporation filed a lawsuit against us alleging that our products infringe certain toshiba patents the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies or enter into license agreements furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  we are a party to lawsuits which if determined adversely to us could require us to pay damages which could harm our business and financial condition 

we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits there can be no assurance that actions that have been brought against us or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor regardless of whether they are in our favor these lawsuits are and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such costs of defense and any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow 

  due to the global nature of our operations economic or social conditions or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in countries throughout the world and also depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located inside and outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others political or social unrest natural disasters epidemic disease war or economic instability in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue costs expenses results of operations and financial condition 

  we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows 

because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen hong kong dollar british pound and the euro related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in us dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful our net income could be adversely impacted 

  traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business 

traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies because of their size generally have had greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

for example many customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality andor had products that caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers as a result this class of customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them would affect our ability to recognize the revenues from such sales which may negatively affect our business and our financial condition 

  our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 

we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 

our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of key executive engineering sales marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain key personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers and sales people and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products 

  our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions past restructuring efforts may prove to be inadequate or may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 

our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning forecasting and management process to enable us to effectively scale our business and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions in periods of market expansion we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in research and development and other parts of our business conversely during 2001 and 2002 in response to downward trending industry and market conditions we restructured our business and reduced our workforce in addition we expect that we will have to change our facilities in certain locations and we may face difficulties and significant expenses identifying and moving into suitable office space and subleasing or assigning any surplus space these changes and other similar actions taken to respond to fluctuating market and economic conditions have placed and our anticipated future operations will continue to place significant demands on our management resources this may increase the potential likelihood of other risks and our business may suffer if we fail to effectively manage changes in the size and scope of our operations 

we may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in restructuring our business in the past and even if successfully implemented these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions furthermore our past workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives lastly costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions andor may not lead to the anticipated cost savings all of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

  if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively affected 

  we are subject to risks arising from our international operations 

we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic regulatory and political conditions in foreign countries including changes in it spending generally the imposition of government controls changes or limitations in trade protection laws unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws natural disasters labor unrest earnings expatriation restrictions misappropriation of intellectual property acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors which could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations in particular in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violations of them violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 

  governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenues 

the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues 

  regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or 

regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could address matters such as voice over the internet or using internet protocol encryption technology and access charges for service providers in addition regulations have been adopted with respect to environmental matters such as the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee and restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs regulations adopted by the european union as well as regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified local certification criteria compliance with such regulations may be costly and timeconsuming for us and our suppliers and partners the adoption and implementation of such regulations could decrease demand for our products and at the same time could increase the cost of building and selling our products as well as impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

  irs notices of proposed adjustments 

the internal revenue service irs has concluded an audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 during 2004 we received a notice of proposed adjustment nopa from the irs while the final resolution of the issues raised in the nopa is uncertain we do not believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations we are also under routine examination by certain state and nonus tax authorities we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these audits 

in conjunction with the irs income tax audit certain of our us payroll tax returns are currently under examination for fiscal years 1999 — 2001 and we received a second nopa in the amount of 117 million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing of tax deposits related to employee stock option exercises we responded to this nopa in february 2005 and intend to dispute this assessment with the irs an initial appeals conference was held on january 31 2006 we currently do not believe that a liability can be reasonably estimated at this time in the event that this issue is resolved unfavorably to us there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  this annual report on form 10k “report” including the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” contains forwardlooking statements regarding future events and the future results of our company that are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the industry in which 

we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management words such as ‘expects’ ‘anticipates’ ‘targets’ ‘goals’ ‘projects’ ‘intends’ ‘plans’ ‘believes’ ‘seeks’ ‘estimates’ variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed in this report under the section entitled “risk factors” in item 1a of part i and elsewhere and in other reports we file with the securities and exchange commission “sec” specifically the most recent reports on form 10q we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forwardlooking statements for any reason 

the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition sales returns warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges tax and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

overview of the results of operations 

to aid in understanding our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2005 we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful 

  significant events 

  business acquisitions 

we completed a total of six acquisitions in the three years ended december 31 2005 the main purposes of these acquisitions were to expand our product portfolio and customer base the results of the following acquisitions have been included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates 

the following is a summary of our acquisitions 

  year ended december 31 2005 

 

 

  year ended december 31 2004 

 

  acquisition related liabilities 

in connection with our acquisitions we recorded liabilities associated with severance future lease and other obligations the initial liabilities were recorded as part of the acquisitions and did not impact the statements of operations the following is a summary of these liabilities 

 

  segments 

as a result of these six acquisitions we now offer two categories of products as well as services organized into the following three operating segments 

 

  acceleration of unvested and “outofthemoney” employee stock options 

on december 16 2005 our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and “outofthemoney” stock options that had an exercise price per share equal to or greater than 2200 all of which were previously granted under our stock option plans and that were outstanding on december 16 2005 options to purchase approximately 212 million shares of common stock or 493 of our total outstanding unvested options on december 16 2005 were accelerated the options accelerated excluded options previously granted to certain employees including all of our executive officers and our directors 

in addition the acceleration of the unvested and “outofthemoney” options was accompanied by restrictions imposed on any shares purchased through the exercise of accelerated options those restrictions will prevent the sale of any such shares prior to the date such shares would have originally vested had the optionee been employed on such date whether or not the optionee is actually an employee at that time 

the purpose of the acceleration was to enable us to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in our statements of operations pursuant to financial accounting standards board statement no 123r “sfas 123r” under sfas 123r we will apply the expense recognition provisions relating to stock options beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 in approving the acceleration our board considered its impact on future financial results stockholder value and employee retention we believe that the acceleration of the unvested and “outofthemoney” options was in the best interest of stockholders as it will reduce our reported compensation expense in future periods in light of these accounting regulations as a result of the acceleration we expect to reduce the pretax stock option expense we otherwise would have been required to record by approximately 153 million subsequent to the adoption of sfas 123r beginning in 2006 the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge to our results of operations in 2005 

the rules regarding option expensing are relatively recent it is possible that changes to existing rules adoption of new rules or the promulgation of rulings or interpretations by the securities and exchange commission or other bodies could cause the ultimate accounting treatment of our options to vary from our current expectations and if applied to periods prior to such changes or rulings could result in changes to historically reported financial information 

  restructuring and other related charges 

  restructuring reserves 

we initiated restructuring plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities focus on strategic product and customer bases reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions the following is a summary of our restructuring plans charged to operating expenses in the statements of operations 

 

during 2005 and 2004 we adjusted our restructuring reserves primarily due to changes in lease and sublease assumptions as our needs changed as a result of our recent acquisitions and as the real estate markets changed 

see note 5 in item 8 for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts remained to be paid 

  impairment charges 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate if an asset is considered to be impaired the impairment charge to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value we assess the recoverability of our longlived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets the amount of impairment if any is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows in december 2005 we recorded an impairment charge of 59 million related to certain kagoor purchased intangibles as a result of a significant reduction in our forecasted revenue associated with kagoor products 

  debt retirement 

through december 31 2004 we paid a total of 9370 million to retire all of our remaining 475 convertible subordinated notes due march 15 2007 “subordinated notes” these transactions affected our cash and cash equivalents investments interest income and interest expense 

  tax repatriation 

we repatriated 2250 million under the american jobs creation act “jobs act” in 2005 we recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of 197 million related to this repatriation dividend the net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax 

provision net of federal benefit of 97 million offset by a tax benefit of 294 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on unrepatriated earnings 

  nature of expenses 

we have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales we have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2005 and 2004 

most of our manufacturing repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers accordingly most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications quality assurance programs and standards that we establish controls around manufacturing engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale california and westford massachusetts our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in canada china malaysia and the united states we generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment 

the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts we may be and have been in the past liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 

employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue employee related costs include items such as wages commissions bonuses vacation benefits and travel we added over 420 and 900 employees in 2005 and 2004 respectively across all functions as a result of acquisitions we had 4145 2948 and 1553 employees as of december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount these departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional infrastructure systems to support our growth we expect these costs to stabilize in 2006 

research and development expenses include 

 

several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred we plan to increase our investment in research and development during 2006 compared to 2005 to further advance our competitive advantage 

sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services demonstration equipment and advertisements these costs vary quartertoquarter depending on revenues product launches and marketing initiatives we plan to further develop our distribution channel in 2006 in an effort to expand and grow our presence in new markets serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of networking products 

general and administrative expenses include professional fees bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses professional fees include legal audit tax accounting and certain corporate strategic services 

  critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical 

experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management’s estimates to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future results of operations will be affected 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

 

 

 

 

  results of operations 

the increases in revenues cost of expenses and operating expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 are attributable to to a certain extent the inclusion of the results of operations from funk acorn peribit redline and kagoor for part of 2005 and netscreen for the full year in 2005 revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses were significantly greater during 2004 compared to 2003 due to the netscreen acquisition 

  net revenues 

the following table shows net revenues and net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues in millions except percentages 

 

our total net revenues increased to 20640 million in 2005 and represents a growth of 54 from 2004 our total net revenues increased to 13360 million in 2004 and represents a growth of 90 from 2003 

  product net revenues 

the 6081 million or 52 increase in our net product revenue from 2004 to 2005 was primarily a result of the adoption and expansion of ip networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network and as a result of the expansion of our product portfolio through acquisitions and internal development during 2005 we recognized 327 million of product revenue from product shipments made to endusers and valueadded resellers that were deferred as of december 31 2004 

infrastructure products accounted for 13678 million or 77 of our total product net revenues during 2005 infrastructure product net revenue grew by 40 from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the increase in revenues from service providers and enterprises 

slt products accounted for 4032 million or 23 of our total product net revenues during 2005 our slt product revenue was primarily driven by the increased demand by the enterprise market our higher net revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to the revenue growth from security products additionally the acquisitions made in 2005 enabled us to cross sell infrastructure security and application acceleration products to existing customer bases an analysis of the change in revenue by infrastructure and slt segments and the change in units can be found below in the section titled “segment information” 

net product revenue increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily as a result of the increase in infrastructure product shipments to meet the customers’ capital expenditures demands and to a lesser extent due to slt net revenue related to the netscreen acquisition 

  service net revenues 

net service revenues increased 1199 million or 69 from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth in support services and to a lesser degree the growth in professional services the growth in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base we recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts that are typically for oneyear renewable periods 

net service revenues increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily as a result of the increase in installed base of customers and products 

  total net revenues 

the following table shows net revenue by geographic region in millions except percentages 

 

we continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic theaters and we expect this trend to continue net revenue in the united states as a percentage of total net revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth driven by increased demand within the service provider and enterprise markets net revenue in emea as a percentage of total net revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to strength across the region including finland greece italy poland and the united kingdom net revenue in japan as a percentage of total net revenue decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to completion by customers of several network expansion projects and a pause in the build out of their next generation network or ngn net revenue in other asia pacific countries as a percentage of total net revenue remained fairly consistent with prior years 

in 2004 net revenue in the americas region grew as a percentage of total net revenue due to the improvement in customer spending in the united states 

siemens accounted for greater than 10 of our net product and service revenues for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 ericsson accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 we expect that our largest customers as well as key strategic partners will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in 2006 and for the foreseeable future 

  cost of revenues 

the following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin “gm” percentages in millions except percentages 

 

reclassifications have been made to product costs in 2004 and 2003 to include related stock compensation expense to conform to the current year presentation 

the two percentage points decrease in product gross margins from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to increasing competition as certain of our products have become more mature in their product cycles as we have expanded our market share and entered more markets since 2004 we have begun to experience increased price competition this price competition has been limited to date as evidenced by our increase in revenue dollars compared to the yearago period as well as relatively comparable product gross margins from year to year we expect to see increasing price competition and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future nevertheless higher product revenue volume contributed to the increased gross margin by 4201 million or 50 in 2005 when compared to 2004 

the six percentage points increase in product gross margins from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to costcutting initiatives that resulted in standard costs and manufacturing support costs increasing at a lesser rate than product net revenues in terms of absolute dollars for the same periods in addition the standard margins on the original netscreen products are more favorable than the standard margins on the infrastructure products and netscreen’s acquisition in 2004 contributed to the increases compared to prior year the improvement in gross margins was also a result of a 160 million reduction in carrying and obsolescence charges from 2003 to 2004 as our historical charges paid to the contract manufacturers decreased the increase in gross margins was partially offset by acquisition charges related to the netscreen acquisition which increased cost of product revenues by 55 million for an inventory fair value adjustment and the amortization of the order backlog intangible asset 

service gross margins increased five percentage points from 2004 to 2005 and was primarily attributable to a larger revenue increase when compared to the increase in headcount outside services and spares purchases all of which were needed to support the growing installed base total employee related expenses as a percentage of service revenue for 2005 decreased to 22 compared to 26 for 2004 nevertheless in absolute dollars total service related costs increased in 2005 compared to 2004 employee related expenses increased 202 million and outside service expenses increased by 175 million as a result of increased headcount during 2005 in addition expense associated with spares increased by 71 million 

service gross margins increased two percentage points from 2003 to 2004 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger installed base and thus a more leveraged service organization this increased leverage was evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses decreased as a percentage of service revenue 26 for 2004 and 27 for 2003 however in absolute dollars employee related expenses increased 185 million from 2003 to 2004 the increases in absolute dollars were due to the netscreen acquisition in addition in absolute dollars outside services costs increased 93 million from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the netscreen acquisition finally the costs associated with spare parts decreased as a percent of service revenue from 2003 to 2004 and remained approximately the same in terms of absolute dollars 

research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

the following table shows research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses amounts and as a percentage of total net revenues in millions except percentages 

 

reclassifications were made to the 2004 and 2003 amounts to include related stock compensation expense to conform to the current year presentation 

research and development expenses increased 955 million in 2005 compared to 2004 but decreased as a percent of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of 664 million facility related expenses of 141 million engineering and testing expenses of 126 million equipment related expenses of 85 million and depreciation of 51 million the increases in personnel related expenses in 2005 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization including those from the five acquisitions the increase is partially offset by the decrease in stock compensation expense of 116 million compared to 2004 as a result of forfeitures of unvested options in 2005 we continue to invest in both standalone as well as integrated products in order to satisfy our customer needs in addition we invested and expanded on our global research and development efforts specifically in china and india 

research and development expenses increased 819 million in 2004 compared to 2003 but decreased as a percent of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing 424 million yearoveryear as a result of the netscreen acquisition the increase in research and development expenses was also the result of a 65 million increase in expensed equipment primarily used in test activities and a 56 million increase in prototype expense the increase in expensed equipment was due to additional research and development requirements resulting from the netscreen acquisition prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public and the amounts reported in a given period can vary depending on the product being developed and the timing 

of the release stock compensation expense increased by 196 million due to the additional amortization of stock options assumed from the netscreen acquisition 

sales and marketing expenses increased 1196 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and decreased as a percent of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of 973 million increases in marketing related activities of 109 million and increases in equipment related expenses of 26 million personnel related expenses increased in 2005 primarily due to additional hires including acquisitions to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base as well as to support the larger portfolio of products marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our distribution channels introduction of new products and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers the increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of 129 million compared to 2004 due primarily to the forfeitures of unvested options in 2005 

sales and marketing expenses increased 1740 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased as a percent of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing 1047 million yearoveryear as a result of the netscreen acquisition and the increase in revenue marketing related expenses increased 223 million due to the netscreen acquisition the branding of the combined companies and the development of a distribution channel and channel sales outside services increased 70 million due to professional services related to marketing activities in addition demonstration equipment increased 64 million due to the netscreen acquisition and the related purchase of security demonstration products for our direct sales force and resellers demonstration equipment is expensed immediately and is closely tied to product launches stock compensation expense increased by 175 million due to the additional amortization of stock options assumed from the netscreen acquisition 

general and administrative expenses increased 196 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and remained at 4 of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in personnel related expenses of 106 million and a 100 million patent related expense  the 100 million patent expense pertained to an agreement we entered into with a thirdparty to avoid future disputes the increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of 09 million compared to 2004 due primarily to the forfeitures of unvested options in 2005 

general and administrative expenses increased 268 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and remained at 4 of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was driven by a 136 million increase in professional services and a 93 million increase in employee related expenses stock compensation expense increased by 20 million due to the additional amortization of stock options assumed from the netscreen acquisition 

  other operating expenses 

the following table shows other operating expenses in millions 

 

  amortization of purchased intangibles 

the amortization expense of intangible assets increased 284 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the additional intangible assets from the five acquisitions completed in 2005 in addition we recognized less than a full year of amortization expense for the intangible assets associated with the netscreen acquisition in 2004 

the amortization expense of intangible assets increased 361 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the intangible assets purchased in the netscreen acquisition 

see note 3 in item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets 

  inprocess research and development 

in 2005 a total of 110 million was charged to iprd expense in connection with three of our five acquisitions during the year of the total funk purchase price 53 million was allocated to inprocess research and development “iprd” of the total peribit purchase price 38 million was allocated to iprd of the total kagoor purchase price 19 million was allocated to iprd none of the acorn or redline purchase prices were allocated to iprd in 2004 275 million was allocated to iprd from the netscreen acquisition and was expensed during the year 

projects that qualify as iprd represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a betaphase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development at the time of acquisition funk peribit kagoor and netscreen had multiple iprd efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 

for funk these efforts included development of new versions for the steelbelted radius “sbr” sbr high availability “ha” and mobile ip module “mim” ii products — all related to the radius product offering iprd as of the acquisition date also included development of new versions for endpoint assurance proxy remote control and odyssey product families at the time of the funk acquisition it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next four months at an estimated cost of approximately 09 million 

for peribit these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the sequence reducer “sr” family sequence mirror “sm” family the central management system “cms” products as well as a hardware program for both the sr and sm families at the time of the peribit acquisition it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately 23 million 

for kagoor these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation products and operating systems at the time of the kagoor acquisition it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of approximately 08 million 

as of december 31 2005 the estimated costs to complete the above research and development efforts were approximately 20 million 

for netscreen these efforts included integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips as well as other functions and features such as next generation internet protocol “ip” wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over ip capability we utilized the discounted cash flow “dcf” method to value the iprd using rates ranging from 20 to 25 depending on the estimated useful life of the technology in applying the dcf method the value of the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated over the remaining economic life of the technology to distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets working capital and other assets that provide value to the product lines at the time of the netscreen acquisition it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately 25 million as of december 31 2005 there was no remaining costs associated with these research and development efforts 

  restructuring impairments and special charges 

we implemented several restructuring plans from 2002 to 2004 as a result of product discontinuation and the acquisitions of unisphere and netscreen restructuring impairments and special charges in 2005 included adjustments of 66 million primarily related to our restructuring accruals when we reoccupied a portion of the former netscreen facility previously included in the acquisition related reserve the credit was partially offset by a 59 million charge associated with the impairment of our purchased intangible assets related to kagoor 

  integration costs 

we incurred immaterial integration expenses for the five 2005 acquisitions and approximately 51 million for the netscreen acquisition in 2004 integration expenses are incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies the integration expenses consisted principally of facility related expenses workforce related expenses and professional fees we estimate that the majority of the integration costs related to our 2005 and 2004 acquisitions have been incurred and that there will be an immaterial amount of additional integration costs for these acquisitions in the foreseeable future 

  other income and expenses 

the following table shows other income and expenses in millions 

 

interest and other income increased 309 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of higher cash cash equivalents and investment balances and an increase in rates of return realized from our investments 

interest and other income decreased 52 million from 2003 to 2004 the decreases were the result of lower rates of return realized from our investments and less realized gains 

interest and other expenses decreased 15 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the retirement of the subordinated notes during 2004 resulting in savings of 25 million which was partially offset by foreign exchange related losses from balance sheet revaluation and bank fees 

interest expense decreased 337 million from 2003 to 2004 almost entirely due to interest saved from the retirement of our subordinated notes 

we have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost adjusted for any impairment as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies we wrotedown these investments by 04 million and 29 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary 

in 2005 we recorded a gain of 17 million in connection with a business combination transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio our cost basis of this equity investment was 10 million 

during 2003 we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as availableforsale which had a cost basis of 43 million and recognized gains of 87 million 

we spent 1450 million and 7920 million during 2004 and 2003 respectively to retire our subordinated notes we recognized net losses of 41 million and 11 million during 2004 and 2003 respectively the losses were a result of the difference between the carrying value of the subordinated notes at the time of their retirement including unamortized debt costs and the amount paid to extinguish such notes 

  provision for income taxes 

provision for income taxes increased to 1482 million in 2005 from 833 million in 2004 the 2005 effective rate was 295 and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to the benefit of tax credits and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the repatriation dividend under the american jobs creation act of 2004 we repatriated 2250 million in 2005 we recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of 197 million related to this repatriation dividend the net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax provision net of federal benefit of 97 million offset by a tax benefit of 294 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on unrepatriated earnings 

provision for income taxes increased to 833 million in 2004 from 198 million in 2003 the 2004 effective rate was 38 and reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions the benefit of tax credits and the inability to benefit certain charges and losses 

  segment information 

a description of the products and services for each segment can be found in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements we began to track financial information by our three operating segments during 2005 as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the business based on management operating income 

we have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2005 for comparative purposes 

financial information for each operating segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows in millions 

 

  infrastructure operating segment 

infrastructure segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 due to the adoption and expansion of ip networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network the following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped 

 

we track infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period 

management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to increases in revenue as evident by the increase in chassis revenue units the increase was partially offset by higher personnel related costs primarily related to support product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels 

  service layer technologies operating segment 

slt segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the netscreen acquisition in 2004 and to a lesser extent the funk peribit redline and kagoor acquisitions and increases in the sales of firewall products in 2005 

management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to increases in net revenue partially offset by increased expenses primarily related to product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels additionally the purchase accounting adjustments related to the netscreen acquisition negatively impacted the revenue and management operating results in 2004 

  service operating segment 

net service revenues increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth in support services and to a lesser degree the growth in professional services the growth in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base service management operating income increased as a result of the revenue growth experienced in the infrastructure segment and the slt segment partially offset by increases in operating costs primarily due to personnel related costs however in absolute dollars employee related expenses increased as a result of increased headcounts expenses associated with spares also increased as a result of revenue growth 

  liquidity and capital resources 

  overview 

we have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities the following table shows our capital resources in millions 

 

working capital increased 2735 million from 2004 to 2005 due to cash provided by operations of 6429 million partially offset by net cash used in investing activities the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable reduced by accounts payable accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months in addition there are no transactions arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources 

  cash requirements and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 

 

 

 36 

  

in connection with the peribit acquisition 16 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of 352 million as of acquisition date have been held in escrow for indemnity obligations we did not include this obligation in the above table since it is a noncash item onehalf of the indemnity obligations will expire in july 2006 and the remaining onehalf will expire in january 2007 

  operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6429 million 4394 million and 1786 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income adjusted by 

 

 

 

  investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 5837 million for the year ended december 31 2005 net cash used in investing activities was 585 million for the year ended december 31 2004 net cash provided by investing activities was 3001 million for the year ended december 31 2003 investing activities included capital expenditures and the purchases and sale or maturities of availableforsale securities the purchase and sale of equity investments and the acquisitions of businesses capital expenditures increased from 2004 to 2005 mainly due to new product developments and overseas expansions and business acquisitions capital expenditures increased from 2003 to 2004 due to our business growth other investing activities include 

 

  financing activities 

net cash provided in financing activities was 1460 million for the year ended december 31 2005 net cash used in financing activities was 334 million and 3075 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively cash was provided during all periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans we spent 1450 million and 7920 million during 2004 and 2003 respectively to retire our subordinated notes we spent 636 million during 2004 to retire 29 million shares of our common stock during 2003 we received net proceeds of 3928 million from the issuance of the senior notes in january and february of 2006 we repurchased 10071000 shares of common stock at an average price of 1851 per share as part of our common stock repurchase program the repurchase did not have a material impact on our liquidity 

  recent accounting pronouncements 

on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 123 revised 2004 “sfas 123r” sharebased payment which is a revision of fasb statement no 123 “sfas 123” accounting for stock issued to employees sfas 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 “apb 25” accounting for stock issued to employees and amends fasb statement no 95 statement of cash flows 

generally the approach in sfas 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas 123 however sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative we adopted sfas 123r on january 1 2006 

sfas 123r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods modified prospective method or modified retrospective method we plan to adopt sfas 123r using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas 123r that remain unvested on the effective date we will recognize in our results of operations the compensation cost for stockbased awards issued after december 31 2005 on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award for stockbased awards issued prior to january 1 2006 we amortize the related compensation costs using the gradedvesting method 

as permitted by sfas 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using apb 25 intrinsic value method and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options the adoption of the sfas 123r fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations because the stockbased compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings the pretax balance of unearned stockbased compensation to be expensed in the period 2006 through 2010 related to sharebased awards unvested as of december 31 2005 as previously calculated under the disclosureonly requirements of sfas 123 was approximately 98 million if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned stockbased compensation expense to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions our stockbased compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions we anticipate we will grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in 2006 the fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it depends on the number of sharebased payments granted and the then current fair values 

sfas 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current standard this requirement will likely reduce net operating cash flow and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future as they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were 1295 million 660 million and 108 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 123r3 transition election and accounting for tax effects the guidance provides a simplified method to calculate the additional paidin capital apic pool for the beginning balance of excess tax benefits and the method of determining the subsequent impact on the pool of option awards that are outstanding and fully or partially vested upon the adoption of sfas no 123r sharebased payment beginning on january 1 2006 in addition this fsp addresses that when the alternative apic pool calculation is used tax benefits related to certain employee awards should be included as a cash flow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities within the statements of cash flows the fsp allows companies up to one year from the later of the adoption date of sfas 123r or november 10 2005 to evaluate the available transition alternatives and make a onetime election we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the new method provided by this guidance 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  interest rate risk 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 

the following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december 31 2005 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 

 

the following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december 31 2004 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions 

 

these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points bps 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 

  foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 

it is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

we uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months 

periodically we use foreign currency forward andor option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates we record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 in other income expense in our results of operations

and security products provide us with a timetomarket lead which is a critical advantage in gaining rapid penetration as one of these selected vendors once our products have been widely deployed in a customer’s network it becomes more difficult for potential competitors to sell to those customers in the future   be strategic to our customers  in developing our infrastructure and security solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build a product specifically to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the challenges facing these customers that increased understanding has enabled us to subsequently design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date we plan to continue to work very closely with our customers to implement enhancements to current products as well as to design future products that specifically meet their evolving needs   enable new ipbased services  our platforms enable network operators to build and secure networks cost effectively and to offer new differentiated services for their customers more efficiently than conventional products we believe that the secure delivery of ipbased services and applications including web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services outsourced enterprise applications and voiceover ip will continue to grow and are costeffectively enabled by our secure networking solutions   establish and develop industry partnerships  our customers have diverse requirements while our products meet certain requirements of our customers our products are not intended to satisfy certain other requirements therefore we believe that it is important that we build relationships with other industry leaders in a diverse set of networking technologies and services these relationships ensure that we have access to those technologies and services whether through joint venture resale acquisition or other collaboration in order to better support a broader set of our customers’ requirements   markets and customers we sell our products and services through distributors and valueadded resellers to endusers in the following markets   service providers service providers include wireline wireless and cable operators supporting most major service provider networks in the world our platforms are designed and built for the scale and dependability that service providers demand our secure networking solutions benefit these customers by    enterprise our secure networking solutions are designed to meet the reliability and scalability demanded by the world’s largest and most advanced networks for this reason network intensive enterprises that rely on their networks for the essence of their business are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications while  2  

   public sector the public sector includes federal state and local governments and research and education institutions our solutions provide the security dependability and performance required by leading government agencies including the united states department of defense intelligence and civilian agencies research and education re networks push the envelope in networking and applications continually demanding the most advanced products and technologies while simultaneously helping shape their development these networks help academic researchers and educators transform their vision into reality with scientific and educational advancements using applications such as telemedicine 3d visualization and simulation grid computing and collaborative videoconferencing juniper networks helps the public sector secure and assure their networking infrastructure by    fundamental requirements for high performance secure networks as they work to support growth in ip traffic and seek to offer new revenue generating or missioncritical services our customers require secure network solutions that are not only feature rich but also deliver high reliability high performance and assured user experiences at the same time both service providers and enterprises must focus on detecting and preventing the ever increasing number of security threats facing the network itself and the data that flows across the network this security must be innate to networking products and must not come at the expense of overall performance or unjustifiable cost feature richness high reliability security high performance scalability and cost effectiveness are each fundamental requirements in meeting the needs associated with the growth in ip traffic and the secure and assured delivery of valueadded services to end users   feature richness the importance of increasing revenue streams and decreasing capital and operational costs for our customers is a significant priority in the industry service providers want to sell more revenue generating services with better cost efficiencies enterprises and other network operators want to provide a secure and assured network experience to their end users on a cost effective but valuegenerating basis each of these goals is ultimately a function of the features and capabilities that can be securely provided on each of the network elements as networks advance more and more features are required to sell new services as well as to lower the ongoing costs of operating the network next generation networking solutions therefore need to have flexibility to add new capabilities frequently without compromising the performance of the system which gets increasingly difficult as the network demands increase  3  

  high reliability  as businesses and consumers increasingly rely on ip networks for missioncritical applications high network reliability is essential as a result those businesses and consumers expect service providers to deliver a high degree of reliability in their networks   security  today’s network environment presents an everincreasing number of challenges regarding network security ranging from simple denial of service attacks to sophisticated pervasive and malicious intrusions the importance of security is increasing within all of our customers and we are continually improving and evolving the security capabilities on all of our product solutions it is extremely important to provide comprehensive networkbased security services that are fully integrated free of performance tradeoffs and scaleable to any customer or market   high performance without compromising intelligence  to handle the rapid growth in ip traffic today’s network operators increasingly require secure networking solutions that can operate at higher speeds while still delivering realtime services such as security and qualityofservice features the processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated forwarding technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination based on priority data type and other considerations since a large number of ip packets many of which perform critical administrative functions are small in size high performance ip routers need to achieve their specified transmission speeds even for small packet sizes since smaller packets increase packet processing demands routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be more resource intensive than routing of larger packets a wire speed router which achieves its specified transmission rate for any type of traffic passing through it can accomplish this task thus provisioning of missioncritical services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed processing   high performance under stressful conditions  in a large and complex network individual components inevitably fail however the failure of an individual device or link must not compromise the network as a whole in a typical network when a failure occurs the network loses some degree of capacity and in turn a greater load falls on the remaining network routers which must provide alternate routes ip infrastructure must quickly adjust to the new state of the network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping significant numbers of packets when active routes are lost or when large numbers of routes change routing protocols are used to accomplish this convergence a process that places even greater stress on the router given the complexity of ip network infrastructure the convergence process is far more complex and places a far greater load on the router thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device   scalability  due to the rapid growth in ip traffic service providers must continuously expand their networks both in terms of increased numbers of access points of presence pops and also greater capacity per pop to facilitate this expansion process secure networking solutions must be highly scalable next generation routers and security appliances therefore need to be flexible and configurable to function within constantly changing networks while incurring minimal downtime   high return on investment  continued growth in ip traffic price competition in the telecommunications market and increasing pressure for network operators to attain higher returns on their network infrastructure investments all contribute to our customers’ desire for solutions that significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build and operate their networks in addition to the basic cost of equipment network operators incur substantial ancillary costs for the space required to deploy the equipment power consumed and ongoing operation and maintenance of the equipment network operators therefore want to deploy dense and varied equipment configurations in limited amounts of rack and floor space therefore in order to continue to scale their networks toward higher data speeds in a cost effective manner network operators need the ability to mix and match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities without significantly increasing the consumption of space or power and driving costs higher these requirements define a clear need for ip infrastructure and security solutions that can support high speeds and offer new ipbased services at the same time network operators are eagerly seeking new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within their networks and reduce the cost of their architectures  4  

  juniper networks technology and products early in the company’s history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific high performance needs of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created our infrastructure products are designed to address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless access by combining highperformance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a networkoptimized solution with the acquisition of netscreen we have added a broad family of network security solutions that deliver high performance costeffective security for enterprises service providers and government entities we offer firewall and virtual private network “vpn” systems and appliances as well as a line of intrusion detection and prevention “idp” appliances both our infrastructure and security solutions are built upon asic and software expertise our infrastructure products offer a full suite of scalable tested routing protocols which are used to control and direct network traffic and are critical to a network routing solution this control is made more important by the fact that the size and complexity of ip networks are increasing at a time when service providers are looking to differentiate themselves through valueadded service offerings our firewall and vpn systems are standardsbased for easy integration into customer networks and deliver integrated firewall vpn and denial of service protection capabilities in a single device our idp appliances incorporate multiple methods of detection such as attack pattern matching protocol anomaly detection and backdoor detection and stop attacks based on known patterns of attack suspicious traffic or connection requests   infrastructure products we believe that an overview of the physical nature of our infrastructure products is helpful in understanding the operation of our business although specific designs vary among our product families our platforms are essentially modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform the chassis contains components that enable and support many of the fundamental functions of the router such as power supplies cooling fans and components that run our junos or junose operating system perform highspeed packet forwarding or keep track of the structure of the network and instruct the packet forwarding components where to send packets each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from the network over a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module in some cases modules do not contain ports or physically receive packets from the network but rather enhance the overall functionality of the router we refer to these components as service modules   major infrastructure product families   mseries and tseries our mseries platforms are extremely versatile as they can be deployed at the edge of operator networks in small and medium core networks and in other applications the mseries product family includes the m320 m160 m40e m20 m10i and m7i platforms our tseries platforms t640 and t320 are primarily designed for core ip infrastructures the mseries and tseries products leverage our asic technology and the same junos operating system to ensure continuous and predictable service delivery while reducing capital and operational costs   eseries our eseries products are a full featured platform with support for carrierclass routing broadband subscriber management services and a comprehensive set of ip services the eseries family includes the erx1440 1410 710 705 and 310 platforms leveraging our junose operating  5  

system the eseries service delivery architecture enables service providers to easily deploy innovative revenue generating services to their customers and avoid the costly and limiting piecemeal outcomes that result from equipment that delivers inconsistent edge services all eseries platforms offer a full suite of routing protocols and provide scalable capacity for tens of thousands of users   major security product families   firewall and vpn systems our netscreen5400 5200 1000 and 500 products are high performance security systems designed to provide integrated firewall vpn and denial of service protection capabilities for enterprise environments and carrier network infrastructures each can be deployed in high bandwidth environments and can be used to deliver managed security services our firewall and vpn systems allow unique security policies to be enforced for multiple virtual local area networks or vlans allowing a single system to secure multiple networks our security systems also allow for the creation of multiple virtual systems each providing a unique security domain with its own virtual firewall and vpn and dedicated management interface these features enable enterprises carriers and government entities to use a single security system to secure multiple networks and enable carriers to deliver security services to multiple customers   firewall and vpn appliances  our netscreen208 204 100 50 25 5xt and 5xp security appliances are fixed configuration products of varying performance characteristics that offer integrated firewall vpn and denial of service protection capabilities our security appliances are designed to maximize security and performance while using less physical space than competing products our security appliances can be deployed to provide small to mediumsized businesses and enterprise remote locations with secure internet access and communication   secure access secure sockets layer “ssl” vpn appliances  our secure access5000 3000 and 1000 appliances are used to secure remote access for mobile employees secure extranets for customers and partners and secure intranets our ssl vpn appliances are designed to be used in enterprise environments of all sizes   intrusion detection and prevention “idp” appliances  our idp1000 500 100 and 10 appliances utilize intrusion detection methods to increase the attack detection accuracy and provide the broadest attack detection coverage available our idp appliances provide fast and efficient traffic processing and alarm collection presentation and forwarding once an attack is detected our idp appliances prevent the intrusion by dropping the packets or connection associated with the attack reducing or eliminating the effects of the attack our idp appliances can also alert the it staff to respond to the attack our idp appliances can be clustered to provide high availability and reduce risk associated with a single point of failure see note 12 in item 8 for a breakdown of net product revenues by categories of products   sales marketing and distribution structure as of december 31 2004 the company employed a staff of 1057 employees in our worldwide sales and marketing organizations these sales employees operate within their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our strategic distribution relationships and valueadded resellers information concerning our revenues by significant customers and by geographic region can be found in note 2 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form 10k   direct sales structure our direct sales organization is organized into three geographic theaters and within each theater according to the particular needs in that market our three geographic theaters are i the americas ii europe middle east and africa and iii asia pacific our direct relationships with our customers are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgement of those orders or by purchase contracts in instances where we have contracts with our customer those contracts set forth only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products  6  

  global channel system in our sales and marketing efforts we also employ a global network of strategic distribution relationships as well as theater or countryspecific distributors and value added resellers within each theater in addition to our direct sales force we employ sales professionals to assist with the management of our various sales channels we have strategic reseller relationships with ericsson ab lucent technologies and siemens ag we believe that each of these companies have significant customer relationships in place and offer products that complement our product offerings our arrangements with each of these partners allow them to resell our products on a worldwide nonexclusive basis provide for discounts based upon the volume of products sold and specify other general terms of sale the agreements do not require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products siemens accounted for greater than 10 of our total revenues in 2004 in addition to these strategic reseller relationships the company maintains relationships with distributors and valueadded resellers in various theaters these distributors and valueadded resellers tend to be focused on particular theaters or particular countries within theaters these resellers have expertise in deploying complex networking solutions in their respective markets our agreements with these resellers are nonexclusive generally limited by theater and provide product discounts and other ordinary terms of sale these agreements do not require our distributors or resellers to purchase specified quantities of our products   customer service and support we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services in most cases our customer service and support organization provides front line product support and is the problem resolution interface to our partners and direct end users we offer the following services 24x7x365 technical assistance hardware repair and replacement unspecified updates professional services and educational services we deliver these services directly to major end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and third party organizations we also train our partners in the delivery of education and support services as of december 31 2004 we employed 337 people in our worldwide customer service and support organization   research and development we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design security routing protocols and embedded software these individuals have been drawn from leading computer data networking and telecommunications companies in addition to building complex hardware and software systems the engineering team has experience in delivering highly integrated asics and scalable technology we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings in our infrastructure and security products we are leveraging our asic technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customer applications and continuing to develop next generation technology to support the anticipated growth in ip network requirements we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface  7  

our research and development process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects this process involves all functional groups and all levels within the company following an assessment of market demand our research and development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market as of december 31 2004 we employed 1184 people in our worldwide research and development organization our research and development expenses totaled 2384 million 1761 million and 1619 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively   manufacturing and operations we employ 105 employees in manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers manage our supply chain and monitor and manage product testing and quality the majority of our manufacturing operation is outsourced we currently have manufacturing relationships primarily with celestica and plexus under which we have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity this subcontracting activity extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs we design specify and monitor all of the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits  our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on rolling forecasts from us about our product needs each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and test the products according to our specifications products are then shipped directly to our distributors valueadded resellers or enduser the company generally does not own the components and our customers generally take title to our products upon shipment from the contract manufacturers in certain circumstances we may be liable to our contract manufacturers for carrying and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on our forecasts although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis our asics are manufactured by ibm and toshiba each of whom is responsible for all aspects of the production of the asics using our proprietary designs  8  

  competition competition in the network infrastructure and security markets is intense cisco systems inc has historically dominated the market with other companies such as nortel networks alcatel sa checkpoint systems inc and huawei technologies providing competitive products in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address we believe that our ability to compete with cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers and are compatible with cisco’s current and future products we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as nortel and alcatel will introduce new products which are designed to compete more effectively in this market as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be successful many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco nortel and alcatel have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products also many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged increased competition could result in price reduction fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could seriously harm our operating results there are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products consolidation in this industry has begun with one or more of these smaller private companies being acquired by large established suppliers of network infrastructure products and we believe it is likely to continue as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have several companies also provide solutions that can substitute for some uses of routers for example high bandwidth asynchronous transfer mode “atm” switches are used in the core of certain major backbone service providers atm switches can carry a variety of traffic types including voice video and data using fixed 53 byte cells companies that use atm switches are enhancing their products with new software technologies such as multiprotocol label switching “mpls” which can potentially simplify the task of mixing routers and switches in the same network these substitutes can reduce the need for large numbers of routers   intellectual property our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and knowhow our engineering teams have significant expertise in asic design and we own all rights to the design of the asics which form the core of many of our products our software was developed internally and is protected by united states and other copyright laws while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed or that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights  9  

  employees as of december 31 2004 we had 2948 fulltime employees 265 of whom were in general and administrative functions none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future   executive officers of the registrant the following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers as of december 31 2004

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   this annual report on form 10k “report” including the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” contains forwardlooking statements regarding future events and the future results of the company that are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the industry in which the company operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the management of the company words such as ‘expects’ ‘anticipates’ ‘targets’ ‘goals’ ‘projects’ ‘intends’ ‘plans’ ‘believes’ ‘seeks’ ‘estimates’ variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed in this report under the section entitled “factors that may affect future results” and elsewhere and in other reports the company files with the securities and exchange commission “sec” specifically the most recent reports on form 10q and the joint proxyprospectus included in the registration statement on form s4 filed with the sec and declared effective on march 11 2004 the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forwardlooking statements for any reason the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   overview of the results of operations to aid in understanding our operating results for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful   significant events in april 2004 we completed our acquisition of netscreen technologies inc “netscreen” in order to expand our customer base and portfolio of products netscreen developed marketed and sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises carriers and government entities we have included in our results of operations the results of netscreen beginning on april 16 2004 therefore revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses are significantly greater during 2004 compared to 2003 and 2002 as a result of the netscreen acquisition we expanded our customer base and portfolio of products which resulted in two categories of networking products infrastructure products which consist predominately of the original juniper networks products and security products which consist predominately of the former netscreen products in july 2002 we completed our acquisition of unisphere a subsidiary of siemens corporation which is a subsidiary of siemens ag “siemens” since the acquisition siemens has been one of our significant resellers unisphere developed manufactured and sold data networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider networks the acquisition enabled us to expand our  16  

customer base and add a complementary product to our existing infrastructure product line without any need to reorganize or modify our existing organizational or cost structure we have included in our results of operations for 2002 the results of unisphere from july 1 2002 the unisphere acquisition impacted revenue cost of revenues and all operating expenses for the second half of 2002 the results for 2003 include a full year of results of the combined companies we have implemented several restructuring plans over the last four years as a result of the economic slowdown which began in 2001 and the acquisitions of unisphere and netscreen in connection with the acquisitions of unisphere and netscreen we initiated plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities focus on strategic product and customer bases reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions during the three months ended september 30 2003 we announced that we would no longer develop our gseries cmts products and recorded a charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs noninventory asset impairment costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs during 2004 we adjusted our restructuring reserves for changes in estimates primarily related to changes in lease and sublease assumptions as our needs changed as a result of the netscreen acquisition and as the real estate markets changed during the three months ended june 30 2003 we issued 4000 million of zero coupon convertible senior notes due june 15 2008 “senior notes” from january 1 2003 through december 31 2004 we paid 9370 million to retire all of our remaining 475 convertible subordinated notes due march 15 2007 “subordinated notes” these transactions affected our cash cash equivalents investments interest income and interest expense   nature of expenses netscreen had a significant distribution channel in place at the time of the acquisition and we are using that channel to target new customers and increase sales we plan to increase the volume of sales that go through our distribution channel during 2005 compared to prior years this shift to selling more products through a distribution channel may impact gross margins most of our manufacturing repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers accordingly most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications quality assurance programs and standards that we establish controls around manufacturing engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale california and westford massachusetts our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in wisconsin canada and malaysia generally our contract manufacturers retain title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract manufacturer’s facility the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts we may be and have been in the past liable for carrying or obsolete material charges carrying and obsolete charges have decreased each of the past two years as the global economy and our product revenue improved employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue employee related costs include items such as wages commissions bonuses vacation benefits and travel we added over 900 employees across all functions as a result of the netscreen acquisition we added approximately 400 employees from the unisphere acquisition in july 2002 we had 2948 1553 and 1542 employees as of december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount these departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional infrastructure systems to support the company’s growth we expect these costs to continue to increase during 2005 as our headcount increases  17  

research and development expenses include  several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred we plan to increase our investment in research and development during 2005 compared to prior years to further advance our competitive advantage sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services demonstration equipment and advertisements these costs vary quartertoquarter depending on revenues product launches and marketing initiatives we plan to further develop our distribution channel and increase our sales and marketing costs in an effort to expand and grow our presence in new markets serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of networking security products general and administrative expenses include professional fees bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses professional fees include legal audit tax accounting and certain corporate strategic services   critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these policies include  we have other important accounting policies and practices however once adopted these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy and not a judgment as to the policy itself we base our estimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are standard and reasonable despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions actual results could differ from those estimates for various reasons including those described in “factors that may affect future results”  18  

  revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured unless we have future obligations for such things as customer acceptance in which case revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met in most cases we recognize product revenue upon shipment to our customers including valueadded resellers “var” as it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a var we defer revenues on sales to our distributors until we have information indicating that the distributor has sold the products to its customers we recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts service contracts are typically for oneyear renewable periods and are for services such as 24hour customer support nonspecified updates and hardware repairs in addition to service contracts we also provide professional and educational services on arrangements where products and services are bundled we determine whether the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the residual method as circumstances dictate we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition this process requires us to make judgments whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and whether we have established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than the fair values in addition our ability to recognize revenue in the future will be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers and by our assessment of collectibility we assess the probability of collection by reviewing our customers’ payment history financial condition and credit report if the probability of collection is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the payment is collected the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also impacted by our judgments made in establishing our reserve for potential future product returns although our arrangements with endusers and vars generally do not include any contractual rights of return and our general policy is that we do not accept returns under certain circumstances we have accepted and may in the future accept product returns from our customers therefore we do provide a reserve for our estimate of future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is recorded our estimate of future returns is based on such factors as historical return data and current economic condition of our customer base in addition we get input from our sales and support organizations on potential product returns relating to specific customer issues the amount of revenue we recognize will be directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for potential future product returns in addition our agreements with distributors provide for limited stock rotation and price protection rights stock rotation rights provide distributors with the right to exchange unsold inventory for alternate products of equal or greater value price protection rights grant distributors the right to a credit on certain purchases in the event of decreases in the prices of our products we accrue for these credits based on our estimates of expected stock rotation and price protection obligations these reserves require us to exercise judgment in determining if historical experience applies to new products and to new distributors if our estimate of returns and exchanges is too low additional charges will be incurred in future periods and these additional charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations our resellers and distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs if actual amounts paid to our resellers and distributors for these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on inputs from our channel marketing department and historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected  19  

  warranty reserves we generally offer a oneyear warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products the warranty generally includes parts and labor obtained through our 24hour service center on occasion the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary we accrue for warranty costs based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations including material costs technical support labor costs and associated overhead the warranty accrual is included in our cost of revenues and is recorded at the time revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims costs per claim and estimated support labor costs and the associated overhead our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary if actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast our gross margins could be adversely affected   contract manufacturer exposures we outsource most of our manufacturing repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our build forecasts these forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast which may be caused by factors outside of our control we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures that would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability   provision for income taxes and tax related accruals estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under sfas 109 accounting for income taxes and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable accordingly a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the us domestic net deferred tax assets has been established to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization of these assets in part due to the potential impact of future stock option deductions in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed a further charge to expense would result   allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the allowance we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen we also consider our historical level of credit losses our reserves historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses if actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established our general and administrative expenses would increase conversely if actual credit losses were to be significantly less than our reserves our general and administrative expenses would decrease  20  

  valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization amortization of purchased intangibles is computed using the straightline method over the related expected useful lives of between four and seven years goodwill is carried at fair value we perform goodwill impairment tests annually and on an interim basis in certain circumstances we performed an impairment analysis in november 2004 and determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill at that time in addition on a quarterly basis we assess if there have been any impairment indictors during the past quarter that could have impacted the carrying value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets when valuing goodwill and purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment we estimate  these estimates include using our revenue and earnings multiples as of the test date discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units and the periods of time with which the products will be in demand any changes in key assumptions about the business reporting units and its prospects or changes in market conditions or other externalities could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   results of operations   net revenues the following table shows product and service net revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 in thousands  

our net revenues for each of the last three years have increased primarily as a result of the improving global economy which resulted in increases in our customers’ capital expenditures for our products beginning in mid2001 the overall global economy deteriorated and most of our customers reduced their capital expenditure budgets we began to see these factors improve in 2003 as was evidenced by the increases in infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped the following table shows infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped for each of the last three years  

infrastructure products contributed 9757 million to product net revenues during 2004 we track infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period  21  

security products contributed 1872 million to product net revenues during 2004 based on approximately 81000 units and the acquisition enabled us to cross sell infrastructure and security products to both customer bases as we have expanded our market share and entered more markets in 2004 we have begun to experience increased price competition this price competition has been limited to date as evidenced by our increase in revenue dollars and product gross margins compared to the yearago period we expect to see increasing price competition and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future service net revenues increased each of the last two years as a result of a larger installed base of customers and products a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts siemens accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during 2004 and 2003 ericsson ab “ericsson” accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during 2003 and 2002 the following table shows net revenue by geographic region in thousands  

we experienced a shift in net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues from the americas region to europe and asia from 2002 to 2003 as our customers’ spending in the americas region declined however as our customers’ spending improved from 2003 to 2004 the americas region grew as a percentage of total net revenues given the current environment we expect the split among the americas and international regions to remain relatively consistent from 2004 to 2005   cost of revenues the following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin “gm” percentages for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 in thousands  

the sixpoint increase in product gross margins from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to costcutting initiatives that resulted in standard costs and manufacturing support costs increasing at a lesser rate than product net revenues in terms of absolute dollars for the same periods in addition the standard margins on the security products are more favorable than the standard margins on the infrastructure products the improvement in gross margins was also a result of a 160 million reduction in carrying and obsolescence charges from 2003 to 2004 as our historical charges paid to the contract manufacturers have decreased the increase in gross margins was partially offset by acquisition charges related to the netscreen acquisition which increased cost of product revenues by 55 million for an inventory writeup adjustment and the amortization of the order backlog intangible asset  22  

the fivepoint increase in product gross margins from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to savings in outsourced manufacturing costs as a result of improved efficiencies and cost cutting initiatives at our contract manufacturers the increase in product gross margins was also due to a 191 million decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges from 2002 to 2003 in addition 2002 included a charge of 51 million related to the unisphere acquisition for backlog orders and an inventory writeup adjustment service gross margins increased three points from 2003 to 2004 and seven points from 2002 to 2003 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger installed base and thus a more leveraged service organization this increased leverage is evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses have decreased as a percentage of service revenue in each of the last two years 26 for 2004 27 for 2003 and 29 for 2002 however in absolute dollars employee related expenses increased 185 million from 2003 to 2004 and 39 million from 2002 to 2003 the increases in absolute dollars were due to the netscreen and unisphere acquisitions in addition in absolute dollars the outside services costs increased 93 million from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the netscreen acquisition finally the costs associated with spare parts decreased as a percent of service revenue from 2003 to 2004 and remained approximately the same in terms of absolute dollars however the costs of spare parts increased as a percent of service revenue from 2002 to 2003 as the costs increased 26 million in terms of absolute dollars   research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the following table shows research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 in thousands  

research and development expenses increased 623 million in 2004 compared to 2003 but decreased as a percent of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing 424 million yearoveryear as a result of the netscreen acquisition the increase in research and development expenses was also the result of a 65 million increase in expensed equipment primarily used in test activities and a 56 million increase in prototype expense the increase in expensed equipment was due to additional research and development requirements resulting from the netscreen acquisition prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public and the amounts reported in a given period can vary depending on the product being developed and the timing of the release research and development expenses increased 142 million in 2003 compared to 2002 but decreased as a percent of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a 132 million increase in employee related expenses as a result of a full year of operations after the acquisition of unisphere in addition we stopped paying bonuses in 2002 as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives however we started to accrue employee bonuses in the second half of 2003 as our financial results improved offsetting the increase in employee related expenses was a 25 million decrease in consulting and contractor services due to our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives and a 25 million decrease in prototype expenses sales and marketing expenses increased 1566 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased as a percent of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing 1047 million yearoveryear as a result of the netscreen acquisition and the increase in revenue marketing related expenses increased 223 million due to the netscreen acquisition the branding of the combined companies and the development of a distribution channel and  23  

channel sales outside services increased 70 million due to professional services related to marketing activities in addition demonstration equipment increased 64 million due to the netscreen acquisition and the related purchase of security demonstration products for our direct sales force and resellers demonstration equipment is expensed immediately and is closely tied to product launches to date we have not incurred significant advertising expenses sales and marketing expenses increased 190 million in 2003 compared to 2002 but decreased as a percent of total net revenues the majority of the increase in absolute dollars was a 214 million increase in employee related expenses in the sales organization in addition customer facing expenses such as marketing events and customer programs increased 20 million offsetting the increases was a decrease of 28 million for demonstration equipment general and administrative expenses increased 248 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and remained at 4 of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was driven by a 136 million increase in professional services and a 93 million increase in employee related expenses general and administrative expenses decreased 58 million and as a percent of total net revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 the majority of the decrease was due to a 71 million reduction in bad debt expense in 2003 compared to 2002 this reduction was a result of more successful than expected collection efforts and the absence of any significant customer bankruptcies the decrease in bad debt expense was partially offset by a 14 million increase in professional services related to certain strategic consulting activities other operating expenses the following table shows other operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 in thousands  

  amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation the amortization expense of intangible assets increased 361 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the intangible assets purchased in the netscreen acquisition the amortization expense of intangible assets increased 68 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the intangible assets purchased in the unisphere acquisition see note 3 in item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets the amortization expense of deferred stock compensation increased 419 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the netscreen acquisition amortization expense of deferred stock compensation was 20 million and 04 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively see note 3 in item 8 for more information on our deferred stock compensation   restructuring and other we have implemented several restructuring plans over the last four years as a result of the economic slowdown which began in 2001 and began to improve in 2003 and the acquisitions of unisphere and netscreen during 2004 we reduced previously established restructuring reserves by  24  

55 million for changes in estimates primarily related to changes in lease and sublease assumptions we found our needs changed as a result of the netscreen acquisition and as the real estate markets changed this reduction was offset by a restructuring charge of 04 million during the three months ended june 30 2004 primarily related to the netscreen acquisition the restructuring charge recorded in 2004 has been completely paid out the remaining restructuring charges from prior years are primarily for facility leases the following is a summary of the restructuring plans the related charges and the remaining obligations  see note 5 in item 8 for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts remaining to be paid   inprocess research and development the allocation of the netscreen purchase price included 275 million to inprocess research and development “iprd” and was expensed in the second quarter of 2004 projects that qualify as iprd represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a betaphase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development at the time of acquisition netscreen had multiple iprd efforts under way for certain current and future product lines these efforts included developing and integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips as well as other functions and features such as next generation internet protocol “ip” wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over ip capability at the time of the netscreen acquisition it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately 25 million as of december 31 2004 it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next nine months at an estimated cost of approximately 105 million the unisphere acquisition included 827 million of iprd these development efforts were completed as of december 31 2003  25  

  integration we incurred integration expenses of approximately 51 million related to the netscreen acquisition and 25 million related to the unisphere acquisition integration expenses are incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies the integration expenses consisted principally of workforce related expenses for individuals transitioning their positions and professional fees   other income and expenses the following table shows other income and expenses for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 in thousands  

interest and other income decreased 52 million from 2003 to 2004 and 230 million from 2002 to 2003 both decreases were the result of lower rates of return realized from our investments and less realized gains partially offset by a gain of 35 million during 2004 from a nonrecurring engineering contract interest expense decreased 337 million from 2003 to 2004 and 165 million from 2002 to 2003 almost entirely due to interest saved from the retirement of our subordinated notes we have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost adjusted for any impairment as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies we wrotedown these investments by 29 million and 505 million in 2004 and 2002 respectively for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary we spent 1450 million 7920 million and 1460 million during 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively to retire our subordinated notes we recognized net losses of 41 million and 11 million during 2004 and 2003 respectively we recognized a gain of 629 million during 2002 the losses and gains were a result of the difference between the carrying value of the subordinated notes at the time of their retirement including unamortized debt costs and the amount paid to extinguish such notes during the first and second quarters of 2003 we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as availableforsale which had a cost basis of 43 million and recognized gains of 87 million during the second quarter of 2001 we entered into a joint venture agreement with ericsson to develop and market products for the wireless internet infrastructure market we recognized our portion of the net loss in this joint venture with ericsson in the amount of 13 million during 2002 as of december 31 2002 we had no further capital funding obligations to this joint venture  26  

  provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased to 833 million in 2004 from 198 million in 2003 due to the increase in income before income taxes the effective rates were approximately 38 and 34 for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase was primarily due to inprocess research and development expenses related to an acquisition that were not deductible for tax purposes the 2004 effective tax rate reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions the benefit of tax credits and the inability to benefit from certain charges and losses the 2003 effective rate reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions the benefit of research credits and capital loss carryforwards and the inability to benefit from certain charges and losses the internal revenue service irs has concluded an audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 during 2004 we received a notice of proposed adjustment nopa from the irs while the final resolution of the issues raised in the nopa is uncertain we believe we have made adequate provisions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that the irs has proposed with respect to these tax returns in conjunction with the irs income tax audit certain of our us payroll tax returns are currently under examination for fiscal years 1999 — 2001 and we received a second nopa in the amount of 117 million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing of tax deposits related to employee stock option exercises we intend to dispute this assessment with the irs and resolve the issue at the appeals level we currently do not believe that it is probable that any final assessment will be sustained nor do we believe that a liability can be reasonably estimated at this time in the event that this issue is resolved unfavorably there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable   liquidity and capital resources   overview we have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities the following table shows our capital resources in thousands  

 working capital increased 4855 million from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to cash provided by operations of 4394 million the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable reduced by accounts payable accrued liabilities and deferred revenue based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months in addition there are no transactions arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources  27  

  cash requirements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands  

 we do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply the contract manufacturers place noncancelable nonreturnable “ncnr” orders which were valued at 699 million as of december 31 2004 based on our build forecasts we do not take ownership of the components and the ncnr orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with the contract manufacturers the components are used by the contract manufacturers to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers we do not incur a liability for products built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customer’s order and the order ships however if the components go unused we may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges as of december 31 2004 we had accrued 190 million based on our estimate of such charges   operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 4394 million 1786 million and 24 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income loss adjusted by   28  

   investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 585 million for the year ended december 31 2004 net cash provided by investing activities was 3001 million for the year ended december 31 2003 net cash used in investing activities was 2955 million for the year ended december 31 2002 investing activities included capital expenditures and the purchases and maturities of availableforsale securities capital expenditures increased from 2003 to 2004 due to our business growing and the netscreen acquisition our capital expenditures decreased from 2002 to 2003 as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives investing activities include    financing activities net cash used in financing activities was 334 million 3075 million and 1194 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively cash was provided during all periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans we spent 1450 million 7920 million and 1460 million during 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively to retire our subordinated notes we spent 636 million during 2004 to retire 29 million shares of our common stock during the second quarter of 2003 we received net proceeds of 3928 million from the issuance of the senior notes   recent accounting pronouncements in december 2004 the fasb revised sfas no 123 “fas 123r” sharebased payment  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards the accounting provisions of fas 123r will be effective for us beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we will adopt the provisions of fas 123r using a modified prospective application under modified prospective application fas 123r which provides certain changes to the method for valuing stockbased compensation among other changes will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under fas 123 see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are in the process of determining how the new method of valuing stockbased compensation as prescribed in fas 123r will be applied to valuing stockbased awards granted after the effective date and the impact the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on our financial statements the emerging issues task force issued eitf issue no 048 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share “eitf 048” during september 2004 eitf 048 states that all issued securities that have embedded conversion features that are contingently exercisable upon occurrence of a marketprice condition should be included in the calculation of diluted eps regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met the eitf 048 consensus must be applied by retroactive restatement based on the terms in effect and amounts outstanding on the last day of the fiscal period in  29  

which the consensus becomes effective eitf 048 was effective for us beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004 eitf 048 applied to our senior notes that were issued in june 2003 the application of eitf 048 reduced the 2003 diluted earnings per share by one cent we have restated our diluted shares and earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2003   factors that may affect future results investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies involve significant risks the market price of our stock reflects a higher multiple of expected future earning than many other companies accordingly even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings whether as a result of our actual financial results acquisitions industry changes or other factors could trigger significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors including but not limited to the following factors that could affect our stock price we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial results competition is intense in the markets that we address the ip infrastructure market has historically been dominated by cisco systems inc with other companies such as alcatel sa nortel networks corporation and huawei technologies providing products to a smaller segment of the market in addition a number of other small public or private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address in the security products market we face intense competition from a broader group of companies including appliance vendors such as cisco systems inc sonicwall inc and watchguard technologies and software vendors such as checkpoint software technologies and symantec corporation we also compete with various emerging private companies and lowcost network hardware suppliers that may position their products as replacements for ours if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price we could experience a loss in market share and revenues andor be required to reduce prices which could reduce our gross margins and which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition we rely on valueadded resellers and distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of valueadded reseller and distribution partners the majority of our revenues are derived through valueadded resellers and distributors most of which also sell competitors’ products our revenues depend in part on the performance of these distributors and valueadded resellers the loss of or reduction in sales to these valueadded resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues our competitors may in some cases be effective in incentivizing resellers or potential resellers to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products if we fail to maintain relationships with these distribution partners fail to develop new relationships with valueadded resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of resellers in existing markets fail to manage train or incent existing valueadded resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer in addition we recognize a substantial portion of our revenue based on a sellthrough model using information provided by our distributors if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted  30  

further in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support it and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products integration of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders we have made and may continue to make acquisitions in order to enhance our business acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire the integration of businesses that we have acquired has been and will continue to be a complex time consuming and expensive process for example although we completed the acquisition of netscreen in april 2004 integration of the products product roadmap operations and personnel is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership of our current stockholders assume liabilities record goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition in addition if we fail in our integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices our business and financial condition may be adversely affected a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners siemens accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during 2004 and 2003 ericsson ab accounted for greater than 10 of our net revenues during 2003 and 2002 any downturn in the business of these customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers which could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations in addition there has been and continues to be consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example the recently announced planned acquisitions of att and mci by sbc and verizon respectively this consolidation may cause our customers who are involved in these acquisitions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or have other unforeseen consequences we expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable our recent level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including product mix shifts increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete increases in material or labor costs excess inventory or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product demand or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures  31  

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future with the current demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed we currently purchase numerous key components including applicationspecific integrated circuits asics from single or limited sources the development of alternate sources for those components is time consuming difficult and costly for example ibm is our sole asic supplier for our infrastructure products and toshiba america electronic components inc is our sole asic supplier for our security products in addition the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner if as a result we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers which would seriously impact present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business in addition the development licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers if we overestimate our requirements the contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory each of which could negatively affect our gross margins conversely because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time if we underestimate our requirements the contract manufacturers may have inadequate materials and components required to produce our products which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a longterm basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price in addition it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships therefore if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations or we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed also the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management for example one of our contract manufacturers has recently begun manufacturing in malaysia each of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial results the fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness customer financial difficulties and constrained spending  32  

on network expansion has previously resulted for example in 2001 and 2002 and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings and could also negatively impact our ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer relationships economic downturns may also lead to restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the shortterm uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments future economic weakness customer financial difficulties and reductions in spending on network expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our results of operations and stock price our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software or hardware errors our business could be adversely affected and we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services our products are highly technical and complex are critical to the operation of many networks and in the case of our security products provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors defects or security vulnerabilities some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by end customers any errors or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition we could face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention in addition if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition could be harmed if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products will be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results in addition if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks orders for our products could be cancelled or our products could be returned this could hurt our operating results damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies because of their size generally have had greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that affect our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition for example many customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality andor had products that caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers as a result this class of customers may  33  

request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may affect our ability to recognize the revenues from such sales which may negatively affect our business and our financial condition if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs or if those products do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner if we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business and financial results even if we are able to anticipate and develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial results our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of key executive engineering sales marketing and support personnel the supply of highly qualified individuals in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas is limited and competition for such individuals is intense none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain key personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers could delay the development and introduction of new products and negatively impact our ability to market sell or support our products recent rulemaking by the financial accounting standards board will require us to expense equity compensation given to our employees and will significantly harm our operating results and may reduce our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees we historically have used stock options as a significant component of our employee compensation program in order to align employees’ interests with the interests of our stockholders encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation packages the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes that will require companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives beginning july 1 2005 by causing us to incur significantly increased compensation costs such accounting changes will reduce our reported earnings and will require us to reduce the availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees which may make it more difficult for us to attract retain and motivate key personnel each of these results could materially and adversely affect our business litigation regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming expensive and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute defend or make our products noninfringing third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products for example in 2003 toshiba corporation filed a lawsuit against us alleging that our products infringe certain toshiba patents the asserted claims andor initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may require us to develop noninfringing technologies or enter into license agreements furthermore because of the potential for high awards of damages that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made  34  

against us by any third party is successful if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we are a party to lawsuits which if determined adversely to us could require us to pay damages which could harm our business and financial condition we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits there can be no assurance that actions that have been brought against us or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor regardless of whether they are in our favor these lawsuits are and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such costs of defense and any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter a customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy throughout the sales cycle we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customer’s network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected we integrate licensed thirdparty technology into certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any thirdparty licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products which could cause us to lose revenues if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of our security products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed this could cause us to lose current and potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential valueadded resellers and distributors because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques  35  

due to the global nature of our operations economic or social conditions or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and valueadded resellers in countries outside of the united states and also depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue costs expenses and financial condition our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions past restructuring efforts may prove to be inadequate or may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process to enable us to effectively scale our business and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions in periods of market expansion we have increased investment in our business by for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in research and development and other parts of our business conversely during 2001 and 2002 in response to downward trending industry and market conditions we restructured our business and reduced our workforce in addition we expect that we will have to change our facilities in certain locations and we may face difficulties and significant expenses identifying and moving into suitable office space and subleasing or assigning any surplus space these changes and other similar actions taken to respond to fluctuating market and economic conditions have placed and our anticipated future operations will continue to place significant demands on our management resources this may increase the potential likelihood of other risks and our business may suffer if we fail to effectively manage changes in the size and scope of our operations we may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in restructuring our business in the past and even if successfully implemented these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions furthermore our workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives lastly costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions andor may not lead to the anticipated cost savings all of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen hong kong dollar british pound and the euro related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in us dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies  36  

currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful our net income could be adversely impacted our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate the factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include limited visibility into customer spending plans changing market conditions including some customer and potential customer bankruptcies changes in the mix of products sold long sales and implementation cycles regional economic and political conditions and seasonality for example many companies experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns particularly in the 1st and 3rd quarters as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below one or more of the expectations of securities analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively affected we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if the network and ip systems do not continue to grow then our business operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth of ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy and capital spending which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenues the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology in addition from time to time governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain required export approval of encryption technologies could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues  37  

while we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2004 requires our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements we expect to incur significant expenses and management resources to section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock we are subject to risks arising from our international operations we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future as a result of our international operations we are affected by economic regulatory and political conditions in foreign countries including changes in it spending generally the imposition of government controls changes or limitations in trade protection laws unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws natural disasters labor unrest earnings expatriation restrictions misappropriation of intellectual property acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors which could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations in particular in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection moreover local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will not take actions in violations of them violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems fines penalties prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using internet protocol encryption technology and access charges for service providers the adoption of such regulations could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  38  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk   interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss at any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures the following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december 31 2004 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands  

these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points bps 100 bps and 150 bps which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate   foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts it is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies we recognize these derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses denominated primarily in the euro japanese yen and british pound these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities between one and two months we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy financial institutions for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates we record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments which was immaterial during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 in other incomeexpense on our consolidated statement of operations in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur or it becomes probable that it will not occur we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other incomeexpense on the consolidated statement of operations at that time for the years  39  

ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 there were no material net gains or losses recognized in other incomeexpense relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur additionally we use foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated primarily in the euro japanese yen and british pound these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other incomeexpense changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange contracts are largely offset by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities these foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the foreign exchange contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2004 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

the global web of interconnected public and private networks across which a variety of media including voice video and data travel to and from end users around the world our network infrastructure solutions enable service providers and other networkintensive businesses to support and deliver services and applications on a highly efficient and low cost integrated network as a result our customers which include service providers government organizations cable operators mobile operators research and education institutions and networkintensive businesses are able to convert networks that provide commoditized best efforts services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation and value and increased reliability and security to end users both corporate and residential at the close of our fiscal year ended december 31 2003 we had generated annual revenues of 7014 million we employed 1553 employees as of december 31 2003 and have conducted business in approximately 70 countries we were incorporated in california in 1996 and reincorporated in delaware in 1997 our corporate headquarters is located in sunnyvale california our website address is wwwjunipernet   the juniper networks strategy our objective and strategy is to transform the business of networking by converting bandwidth which is a commodity into a dependable secure and highly valuable corporate asset our technological leadership and problem solving abilities combined with our experience and fundamental understanding of the requirements of high performance ip network infrastructure will help us in meeting our objectives key elements of our strategy are described below   maintain and extend technology leadership  our applicationspecific integrated circuit asic technology software and networkoptimized product architecture have been key elements to establishing our technology leadership we believe that these elements can be leveraged into future products we are currently developing we intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the network infrastructure market through continued investment to enhance the feature richness of our products and to develop future differentiated offerings for our customers   leverage early lead as supplier of purposebuilt network infrastructure  from inception we have focused on designing and building ip network infrastructure for service providers and network intensive businesses and have integrated purposebuilt technology into a network optimized architecture that specifically meets our customers’ needs we believe that many of these customers will deploy network infrastructure equipment from only a few vendors the purposebuilt advantages of our products provide us with a timetomarket lead which is a critical advantage in gaining rapid penetration as one of these selected vendors once our products have been widely deployed in a customer’s network we create a significant barrier to entry to potential competitors who do not currently offer commerciallyviable next generation routing solutions   be strategic to our customers  in developing our solutions we work very closely with customers to design and build a product specifically to meet their complex needs over time we have expanded our understanding of the challenges facing these customers that increased understanding has enabled us to subsequently design additional capabilities into our products we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date we plan to continue to work very closely with our customers to implement enhancements to current products as well as to design future products that specifically meet their evolving needs 1   enable new ipbased services  our platform enables network operators to build networks cost effectively and to offer new differentiated services for their customers more efficiently than conventional products we believe that the delivery of ipbased services and applications including web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services outsourced enterprise applications and voiceover ip will continue to grow and are costeffectively enabled by our network infrastructure solutions   establish and develop industry partnerships  our customers have diverse requirements some of which our products satisfy our products are not intended to satisfy certain other requirements therefore we believe that it is important to build relationships with other industry leaders in a diverse set of networking technologies in order to fully support our customers’ requirements   markets and customers our customers include network operators in and value added resellers that sell into the following markets service providers supporting nearly every major service provider network in the world our platforms are designed and built for the scale and dependability that service providers demand our ip infrastructure solutions benefit these customers by  government organizations our solutions provide the security dependability and performance required by leading government agencies including the united states department of defense intelligence and civilian agencies juniper networks helps government agencies transform their networking infrastructure by  cable operators our solutions can enable cable operators to migrate their business model and systems from a flat rate internet access offering to delivery of rich payperuse content our platforms enable cable operators to enhance profitability by 2  mobile operators we play a leadership role as the mobile industry transforms into a business environment in which many interactive voice and data services are supported over a single costefficient infrastructure mobile providers are improving existing business models with our solutions by  research and education institutions research and education re networks push the envelope in networking and applications continually demanding the most advanced products and technologies while simultaneously helping shape their development these networks help academic researchers and educators transform their vision into reality with scientific and educational advancements using applications such as telemedicine 3d visualization and simulation grid computing and collaborative videoconferencing our products are deployed in re institutions and networks worldwide and further those institutions goals by providing  networkintensive businesses our solutions are designed to meet the reliability and scalability demanded by the world’s largest and most advanced networks for this reason information intensive enterprises that rely on their networks for the essence of their business are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leadingedge applications while    fundamental requirements for high performance low cost integrated networks as they work to support dramatic growth in ip traffic and seek to offer new revenue generating or missioncritical services service providers government organizations cable operators mobile operators and networkintensive businesses require network 3 infrastructure equipment that is not only feature rich but also delivers high reliability and performance feature richness high reliability high performance security scalability interoperability and cost effectiveness are each fundamental requirements in meeting the needs associated with the growth in ip traffic and the efficient delivery of valueadded services to end users   feature richness the importance of increasing revenue streams and decreasing capital and operational costs for our customers is a significant priority in the industry customers want to sell more revenue generating services with better cost efficiencies which is ultimately a function of the features and capabilities that can be provided on each of the network elements most of the feature richness evolves in software and as the networks advance more and more features are required to sell new services as well as to lower the ongoing costs of operating the network next generation routers therefore need to have flexibility to add new capabilities frequently without compromising the performance of the system which gets increasingly difficult as the network demands increase   high reliability  as businesses and consumers increasingly rely on ip networks for missioncritical applications high network reliability is essential as a result those businesses and consumers expect service providers to deliver a high degree of reliability in their networks   high performance without compromising intelligence  to handle the rapid growth in ip traffic today’s network operators increasingly require network infrastructure that can operate at higher speeds while still delivering realtime services such as security and qualityofservice features the processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated forwarding technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination based on priority data type and other considerations since a large number of ip packets many of which perform critical administrative functions are small in size high performance ip routers need to achieve their specified transmission speeds even for small packet sizes since smaller packets increase packet processing demands routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be more resource intensive than routing of larger packets a wire speed router which achieves its specified transmission rate for any type of traffic passing through it can accomplish this task thus provisioning of missioncritical services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed processing   high performance under stressful conditions  in a large and complex network individual components inevitably fail however the failure of an individual device or link must not compromise the network as a whole in a typical network when a failure occurs the network loses some degree of capacity and in turn a greater load falls on the remaining network routers which must provide alternate routes ip infrastructure must quickly adjust to the new state of the network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping significant numbers of packets when active routes are lost or when large numbers of routes change routing protocols are used to accomplish this convergence a process that places even greater stress on the router given the complexity of ip network infrastructure the convergence process is far more complex and places a far greater load on the routing software thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device   security  there are more and more issues everyday regarding network security ranging from simple denial of service attacks to sophisticated pervasive and malicious intrusions the challenge of security is increasing in awareness within all of our customers and we are continually improving and evolving the security capabilities on product solutions it is extremely important to provide comprehensive networkbased security services that are fully integrated free of performance tradeoffs and scaled to any customer or market   scalability  due to the rapid growth in ip traffic service providers must continuously expand their networks both in terms of increased numbers of access points of presence pops and also greater capacity per pop to facilitate this expansion process network infrastructure equipment must be highly scalable next generation routers therefore need to be flexible and configurable to function within constantly changing networks while incurring minimal downtime   interoperability  in order to gain acceptance in ip networks new products must be compatible with the existing network environment given the open and interconnected nature of the public network infrastructure service providers government organizations cable operators mobile operators and networkintensive businesses must control and police traffic on their 4 networks as a result the operating system in each router must offer 100 compatibility with the interior protocols and standards used within each network the compatibility level must be maintained despite changes to equipment configuration and network architecture and upgrades to the various protocol standards thus the operating system must be flexible to support any necessary revisions this level of compatibility in turn cannot impact the performance scalability or reliability of the equipment attaining this sophisticated level of interoperability is highly challenging and requires significant testing to ensure compatibility   high return on investment in network infrastructure  continued growth in ip traffic price competition in the telecommunications market and increasing pressure for network operators to attain higher returns on their network infrastructure investments all contribute to our customers’ desire for solutions that significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build and operate their networks in addition to the basic cost of equipment network operators incur substantial ancillary costs for the space required to deploy the equipment power consumed and ongoing operation and maintenance of the equipment network operators therefore want to deploy dense and varied equipment configurations in limited amounts of rack and floor space therefore in order to continue to scale their networks toward higher data speeds in a cost effective manner network operators need the ability to mix and match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities without significantly increasing the consumption of space or power and driving costs higher these requirements define a clear need for ip infrastructure solutions that can support high speeds and offer new ipbased services at the same time network operators are eagerly seeking new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within their networks and reduce the cost of their architectures   juniper networks technology and products early in the company’s history we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt ip backbone router optimized for the specific high performance needs of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created our products are designed to address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless and cable access by combining highperformance packet forwarding technology and rich software into a networkoptimized solution today as then our technology is built upon our router architecture asic and software expertise our products offer a full suite of scalable tested routing protocols which are used to control and direct network traffic and are critical to a network routing solution this control is made more important by the fact that the size and complexity of ip networks are increasing at a time when service providers are looking to differentiate themselves through valueadded service offerings   general product architecture we believe that an overview of the physical nature of our products is helpful in understanding the operation of our business although specific designs vary among our product families our platforms are essentially modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform the chassis contains components that enable and support many of the fundamental functions of the router such as power supplies cooling fans and components that run our junos or junose operating system perform highspeed packet forwarding or keep track of the structure of the network and instruct the packet forwarding components where to send packets each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from the network over a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module in some cases modules do not contain ports 5 or physically receive packets from the network but rather enhance the overall functionality of the router we refer to these components as service modules   product families   mseries and tseries our mseries platforms are extremely versatile as they can be deployed at the edge of operator networks in small and medium core networks and in other applications the mseries product family includes the m5 m7i m10 m10i m20 m40e m160 and m320 platforms our tseries platforms t320 and t640 are primarily designed for core ip infrastructures the mseries and tseries products leverage our asic technology and the same junos operating system to ensure continuous and predictable service delivery while reducing capital and operational costs   eseries our eseries products are a full featured platform with support for carrierclass routing broadband subscriber management services and a comprehensive set of ip services the eseries family includes the erx310 erx705 erx710 erx1410 and erx1440 platforms leveraging our junose operating system the eseries service delivery architecture enables service providers to easily deploy innovative revenue generating services to their customers and avoid the costly and limiting piecemeal outcomes that result from equipment that delivers inconsistent edge services all eseries platforms offer a full suite of routing protocols and provide scalable capacity for tens of thousands of users   j20 our j20 product developed together with ericsson ab provides a scalable solution for wireless networks and supports wireless operators in their evolution from voicecentric networks to the new multimediarich networks   sales marketing and distribution structure as of december 31 2003 the company employed a staff of 434 employees in our worldwide sales and marketing organizations these sales employees operate within their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our strategic distribution relationships and valueadded resellers information concerning our revenues by significant customers and by geographic region can be found in note 2 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form 10k   direct sales structure our direct sales organization is organized according to theater and within each theater according to the particular needs in that market for example currently the americas sales theater is organized into three geographic areas and two vertical markets in addition within the us geographic areas the major incumbent carriers are assigned dedicated account teams that operate separately from the territory teams the asiapacific sales theater is organized into four geographic areas while the emea sales theater is organized into six major account teams and geographic teams covering all activity outside of the major accounts our direct relationships with our customers are generally governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgement of those orders or by purchase contracts in instances where we have contracts with our customer those contracts set forth only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products   global channel system in our sales and marketing efforts we also employ a global network of strategic distribution relationships as well as theater or countryspecific value added resellers within each theater in addition to our direct sales force we employ sales professionals to assist with the management of our various channel partners 6 we have strategic distribution relationships with ericsson ab lucent technologies and siemens ag we believe that each of these companies have significant customer relationships in place and offer products that complement our product offerings our arrangements with each of these partners allow them to distribute our products on a worldwide nonexclusive basis provide for discounts based upon the volume of products sold and specify other general terms of sale the agreements do not require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products each of ericsson and siemens accounted for greater than 10 of our total revenues in 2003 in addition to these strategic distribution relationships the company maintains relationships with valueadded resellers in various theaters these resellers tend to be focused on particular theaters or particular countries within theaters these resellers have expertise in deploying complex network infrastructure in their respective markets our agreements with these resellers are nonexclusive generally limited by theater and provide volumebased discounts and other ordinary terms of sale these agreements do not require resellers to purchase specified quantities of our products   customer service and support we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services in most cases our customer service and support organization provides front line product support and is the problem resolution interface to our partners and direct end users we offer the following services 24x7x365 technical assistance hardware repair and replacement professional services and educational services we deliver these services directly to major end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and third party organizations we also train our partners in the delivery of education and support services as of december 31 2003 we employed 190 people in our worldwide customer service and support organization   research and development we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of highend computing network system design routing protocols and embedded software these individuals have been drawn from leading computer data networking and telecommunications companies in addition to building complex hardware and software systems the engineering team has experience in delivering highly integrated asics and scalable technology we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings we are leveraging our asic technology developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customer applications and continuing to develop next generation technology to support the anticipated growth in ip network requirements we continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface our research and development process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects this process involves all functional groups and all levels within the company following an assessment of market demand our research and development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market as of december 31 2003 we employed 669 people in our worldwide research and development organization 7 our research and development expenses totaled 1761 million 1619 million and 1555 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively   manufacturing our manufacturing operation is outsourced we currently have manufacturing relationships with celestica and plexus under which we have subcontracted our manufacturing activity this subcontracting activity extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material procurement final assembly test control shipment to our customers and repairs we design specify and monitor all of the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits  our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on rolling forecasts from us about our product needs each of the contract manufacturers procure components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and test the products according to our specifications products are then shipped directly to our customers the company is not the owner of any of the components and our customers generally take title to our products upon shipment from the contract manufacturers in certain circumstances we may be liable to our contract manufacturers for carrying and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on our forecasts although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us the contracts do not require them to accept purchase orders from us or to manufacture our products on a longterm basis our asics are manufactured by ibm who is responsible for all aspects of the production of the asics using our proprietary designs   competition competition in the network infrastructure market is intense cisco systems inc “cisco” has historically dominated the market with other companies such as nortel networks and alcatel sa providing products to a smaller segment of the market in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address cisco traditionally has been the dominant supplier of solutions to our markets we believe this is the result of its early leadership position in the enterprise router market as both large public and private networks and traffic over the internet has grown rapidly cisco has leveraged this position and has developed a broad product line of routers that support all major local area and wide area interfaces we believe that our ability to compete with cisco depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers and are extremely compatible with cisco’s current and future products although we believe that we are currently among the top providers of ip infrastructure solutions worldwide we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with cisco currently the leading provider in this market 8 we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as nortel and alcatel will introduce new products which are designed to compete more effectively in this market as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be successful many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco nortel and alcatel have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products also many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged increased competition could result in price reduction fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could seriously harm our operating results there are also many small public and private companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products consolidation in this industry has begun with one or more of these smaller private companies being acquired by large established suppliers of network infrastructure products and we believe it is likely to continue as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have several companies also provide solutions that can substitute for some uses of routers for example high bandwidth asynchronous transfer mode “atm” switches are used in the core of certain major backbone service providers atm switches can carry a variety of traffic types including voice video and data using fixed 53 byte cells companies that use atm switches are enhancing their products with new software technologies such as multiprotocol label switching “mpls” which can potentially simplify the task of mixing routers and switches in the same network these substitutes can reduce the need for large numbers of routers   intellectual property our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and knowhow our engineering teams have significant expertise in asic design and we own all rights to the design of the asics which form the core of many of our products our software was developed internally and is protected by united states and other copyright laws we currently have 30 issued us patents expiring between 2016 and 2021 while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights while we have filed patent applications we cannot be certain that these applications will issue into patents that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights   employees as of december 31 2003 we had 1553 fulltime employees 260 of whom were in finance administration it and operations none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of whom is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our 9 future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future   available information we file our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   this annual report on form 10k “report” including the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” contains forwardlooking statements regarding future events and the future results of the company that are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the industry in which the company operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the management of the company words such as ’expects’ ‘anticipates’ ‘targets’ ‘goals’ ‘projects’ ‘intends’ ‘plans’ ’believes’ ‘seeks’ ‘estimates’ variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed in this report under the section entitled “risk factors” and elsewhere and in other reports the company files with the securities and exchange commission “sec” specifically the most recent reports on form 10q each as it may be amended from time to time the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forwardlooking statements for any reason the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangible assets contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   overview of the business juniper networks inc “juniper networks” or “we” was founded in 1996 to develop and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of service providers today we are a leading provider of network infrastructure solutions that transform the business of networking our products enable customers to improve their business models by providing more differentiation and value to end users as well as increased reliability and security thereby making the network a more valuable asset we sell and market our products through our direct sales organization and valueadded resellers   overview of the results of operations 14 to aid in understanding our operating results for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 we believe an overview of the significant events that occurred during those years and a discussion of the nature of the expenses is helpful   significant events as a result of an economic slowdown beginning in 2001 and going into 2003 many telecommunication service providers cut back capital expenditure and discretionary spending budgets these cut backs contributed to the decrease in our revenues beginning in late 2001 and through 2002 to help combat the financial impact of the reduction in revenue we undertook a series of initiatives the first initiative was a restructuring in 2001 to better align our operations with the then current market and service provider industry conditions this restructuring initiative included a worldwide workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities and restructuring of certain business functions in july 2002 we completed our acquisition of unisphere networks inc “unisphere” a subsidiary of siemens corporation which is a subsidiary of siemens ag “siemens” unisphere developed manufactured and sold data networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider networks the acquisition enabled us to expand our customer base and add a complementary product to our existing product line without any need to reorganize or modify our existing organizational or cost structure in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” we have included in our results of operations for 2002 the results of unisphere from july 1 2002 the unisphere acquisition impacted revenue cost of revenues and all operating expenses for the second half of 2002 the results for 2003 include a full year of results of the combined companies in connection with the acquisition of unisphere we initiated plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities focus on strategic product and customer bases reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions in 2003 we announced that we were no longer developing our gseries cmts products and recorded a onetime charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs noninventory asset impairment the costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs we expect this action to facilitate the focus on core competencies and reduce cost structure during the second calendar quarter of 2003 we issued 4000 million of zero coupon convertible senior notes due june 15 2008 also during 2003 we paid 7920 million to retire a portion of the 475 convertible subordinated notes due march 15 2007 these transactions had an effect on our cash cash equivalents investments interest income and interest expense   nature of expenses most of our manufacturing repair and supply chain management operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers accordingly most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers the independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products using quality assurance programs and standards that we establish controls around manufacturing engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale california and westford massachusetts our independent contract manufacturers have facilities in neenah wisconsin and toronto canada generally our contract manufacturers retain title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract manufacturer’s facility we realized savings in carrying and obsolete material charges from 2001 to 2002 and through 2003 the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is significantly lower than our forecasts 15 we may be and have been in the past liable for carrying or obsolete material charges during 2001 there was a large expense related to carrying and obsolete material due to the change in the global economy and the sudden decrease in product revenues during the first half of 2002 the global economy continued to have an adverse effect on our revenues however it began to improve during the second half in addition as part of the unisphere acquisition we consolidated our outsourced contract manufacturing operations from three to two and incurred additional carrying and obsolete material charges carrying and obsolete charges decreased during 2003 as the global economy and our product revenue continued to improve the primary component of our operating expenses historically has been employee related costs which includes items such as wages commissions bonuses vacation benefits and travel in addition the facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount following are descriptions of the unique expense items in each operating expense class we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred research and development expenses include the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products outside services for such services as certifications of new products equipment used for testing and patent related costs several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services demonstration equipment and advertisements these costs can vary quartertoquarter depending on revenues product launches and marketing initiatives in addition to employee related expenses general and administrative expenses include professional fees bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses professional fees include legal audit tax accounting and corporate strategic services   critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these policies include  we have other important accounting policies and practices however once adopted these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy and not a judgment as to the policy itself we base our estimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are standard and reasonable despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions actual results could differ from those estimates   revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive 16 evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured unless we have future obligations for such things as network interoperability or customer acceptance in which case revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met in most cases we recognize product revenue upon shipment to our customers including resellers as it is our policy to ensure an end user has been identified prior to shipment service revenue is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the service period beginning july 1 2003 we recognized revenue on arrangements where products and services were bundled in accordance with eitf 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” in applying the concepts of eitf 0021 we must determine whether the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the residual method as circumstances dictate we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition the application of eitf 0021 includes judgments whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and whether we have established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than the fair values in addition our ability to recognize revenue in the future will be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers and by our assessment of collectibility we assess the probability of collection by reviewing our customers’ payment history financial condition and credit report if the probability of collection is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the payment is collected the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also impacted by our judgments made in establishing our reserve for potential future product returns although our arrangements do not include any contractual rights of return and our general policy is that we do not accept returns under unique circumstances we have and may in the future accept product returns from our customers therefore we do provide a reserve for our estimate of future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is recorded our estimate of future returns is based on such factors as historical return data and current economic condition of our customer base in addition we get input from our sales and support organizations on potential product returns relating to specific customer issues the amount of revenue we recognize will be directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for potential future product returns   allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the amount of the allowance we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen we also consider our historical level of credit losses our reserves historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses if actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established our general and administrative expenses would increase conversely if actual credit losses were to be significantly less than our reserves our general and administrative expenses would decrease   contract manufacturer exposures we outsource most of our manufacturing repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers accordingly a significant portion of the cost of revenues consists of payments to them our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture products based on our build forecasts these forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products these estimates are based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures that would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability demand for our products and component usage are largely affected by factors that are outside of our control   warranty reserves we generally offer a oneyear warranty on all of our hardware products as well as a 90day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products the warranty generally includes parts labor and 24hour service center support on occasion the specific terms and conditions of those 17 warranties vary we record a liability based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and charge to cost of product sales the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary if actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast our gross margins could be adversely affected   provision for income taxes estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under sfas 109 “accounting for income taxes” and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable accordingly a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets has been established to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization of these assets in part due to the potential impact of future stock option deductions in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed a further charge to expense would result   results of operations   net revenues the following table shows product and service net revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 in thousands  our net revenues for each of the last three years have primarily changed as a result of the changes in the global economy which caused fluctuations in our customers’ capital expenditure budgets beginning in mid2001 the overall global economy deteriorated and most of our customers reduced their capital expenditure budgets we began to see these factors improve in 2003 as was evidenced by the change in chassis revenue units and ports shipped as summarized in the table below  our platforms are essentially modular with the chassis serving as the base of the platform each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module 18 chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period chassis revenue units and ports shipped are tracked to analyze customer trends and are used as indicators for potential network growth the increase in product net revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 was due primarily to an increase in the demand for our products resulting from our customers expanding their networks for new applications and users partially offset by a shift in product mix to less expensive products we did not experience any unusual pricing pressure in 2003 compared to 2002 the decrease in product net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 was due primarily to a decrease in the demand for our products that resulted from the generally unfavorable economic conditions throughout 2002 and a shift in product mix to less expensive products service net revenues increased each of the last two years as a result of a larger installed base of customers and products a majority of service revenue is from customers who previously purchased our products and enter into a service contract in addition to service contracts service revenue is generated from providing professional and educational services service contracts are typically for oneyear renewable periods and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period two customers individually accounted for 15 and 13 of total net revenues in 2003 for 2002 one customer accounted for 17 of net product revenues compared to 2001 where one customer accounted for 14 a second customer accounted for 13 and a third customer accounted for 11 of net product revenues management began including service revenue in its calculation of significant customers in the second half of 2002 the following table shows net revenue by geographic region in thousands  we experienced a shift in net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues from the americas region to europe and asia during the last two years as the capital spending market in the united states declined at a greater rate than the international market we expect the split among the americas and international regions to remain relatively consistent during 2004   cost of revenues the following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin “gm” percentages for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 in thousands  the increase in product gross margins from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to savings in outsourced manufacturing costs as a result of improved efficiencies and cost cutting initiatives at our contract manufacturers the increase in product gross margins was also due to a 62 decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges from 2002 to 2003 in addition 2002 included a onetime charge of 51 million related to the unisphere acquisition for backlog orders and an inventory writeup adjustment 19 product gross margins were flat at 62 for 2002 and 2001 as a result of operational costs being cut as the demand for our products decreased the decrease in absolute dollars for cost of product revenue from 2001 to 2002 was directly related to the decrease in product revenue which was primarily a result of unfavorable economic conditions many customers experienced throughout 2002 as well as to a 37 decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges service gross margins increased from 2002 to 2003 as a result of the 25 increase in service revenue as compared to only a 13 increase in cost of service revenues we were able to grow service revenue at a faster rate than cost of service revenues due to improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger install base and thus a more leveraged service organization this increased leverage is evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses decreased as a percentage of service revenue from 29 for 2002 to 27 for 2003 however in absolute dollars employee related expenses increased slightly in addition in absolute dollars the costs associated with spare parts increased by 39 year over year service gross margins increased from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a larger installed base of customers and products combined with realized savings in our service organization for personnel and other related costs associated with our restructuring activities   research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the following table shows research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 in thousands  research and development expenses increased 142 million in 2003 compared to 2002 but decreased as a percent of total net revenues the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a 16 increase in employee related expenses as a result of a full year of operations after the acquisition of unisphere in addition we stopped paying bonuses in 2002 as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives however we started to accrue employee bonuses in the second half of 2003 as our financial results improved offsetting the increase in employee related expenses was a 35 decrease in consulting and contractor services due to our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives and a 28 decrease in prototype expenses prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public and the amounts can vary depending on the product being developed research and development expenses increased 64 million and as a percent of total net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 the increases were primarily a result of a 50 increase in headcount related expenses a 48 increase in the use of consulting and contractor services partially offset by 63 savings in prototype equipment headcount related expenses and consulting and contractor services increased primarily due to the unisphere acquisition prototype equipment expenses were higher during 2001 because we were preparing for the release of our highend t series products as well as certain mseries and jseries products and developing and testing a new family of application specific integrated circuits asics we expect to continue to devote resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading technology and meet the changing requirements of our customers we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 20 sales and marketing expenses increased 190 million in 2003 compared to 2002 but decreased as a percent of total net revenues the majority of the increase in absolute dollars was a 32 increase in employee related expenses in the sales organization as a result of additional headcount and commissions resulting from the increase in revenue in addition customer facing expenses such as marketing events and customer programs increased 40 offsetting the increases was a decrease of 41 for demonstration equipment which is expensed immediately and is closely tied to product launches to date we have not incurred significant advertising expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased 136 million in 2002 compared to 2001 but increased as a percent of net revenues the decrease in absolute dollars was a result of a 63 decrease in costs related to employee and partner events a 23 reduction in the use of demonstration equipment and consolidation of excess facilities all of which are attributable to our cost cutting initiatives we intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers worldwide we believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success general and administrative expenses decreased 58 million and as a percent of total net revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 the majority of the decrease was due to a 91 reduction in bad debt expense in 2003 compared to 2002 this reduction was a result of greater than expected collection efforts and the absence of any significant customer bankruptcies the decrease in bad debt expense was partially offset by a 22 increase in professional services related to certain strategic consulting activities general and administrative expenses decreased 33 million in 2002 compared to 2001 but increased as a percent of total net revenues the decrease was due to a 15 savings in employee related expenses and a 12 decrease in the use of outside services both of which are attributable to our cost cutting initiatives   other operating expenses the following table shows other operating expenses in absolute dollars for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 in thousands  restructuring and other in the third quarter of 2003 we announced that we are no longer developing our gseries cmts products and recorded a onetime charge of approximately 140 million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs noninventory asset impairment vacating facilities costs the costs associated with termination of contracts and other related costs our board of directors approved the restructuring charge and expects that the plan will facilitate the focus on core competencies and reduce our cost structure the following table shows the breakdown of the restructuring charge and the liability remaining as of december 31 2003 in thousands  21  the workforce reduction related primarily to the termination of 76 employees that were mainly located in the americas and europe regions we expect to pay the remaining balance of the severance accrual by the end of the first quarter of 2004 noninventory asset impairment was primarily for longlived assets that were no longer needed as a result of our decision to cease further development of the product line facility charges consist primarily of the cost of vacating facilities that were dedicated to the development of the gseries cmts products and the impairment cost of certain leasehold improvements the net present value of the facility charge was calculated using our riskadjusted borrowing rate amounts related to the net facility charge will be paid over the respective lease term through july 2008 the difference between the actual future rent payments and the net present value will be recorded as operating expenses when incurred other contractual commitments and other charges consist primarily of 09 million of carrying and obsolete material charges from our contract manufacturers and suppliers for onhand and onorder material related to the gseries cmts products and 09 million of costs to satisfy endoflife commitments in certain customer contracts all of these costs were included as a charge to the results of operations in the quarter ended september 30 2003 changes to the estimates of executing the currently approved plans of restructuring will be reflected in results of operations during the third quarter of 2002 in connection with the acquisition of unisphere we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately 149 million associated primarily with workforce related costs costs of vacating duplicative facilities contract termination costs noninventory asset impairment charges and other associated costs net of a 26 million adjustment due to a change in estimate as of december 31 2003 there was 31 million remaining to be paid entirely related to facility costs to be paid through april 2009 we also recognized a charge of approximately 53 million during the quarter ended september 30 2002 related to the land acquired in january 2001 located in sunnyvale california the charge was primarily for costs of exiting certain contractual obligations associated with the land we currently have no plans to continue developing the land in the foreseeable future in june 2001 we announced a restructuring program that included a worldwide workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities and restructuring of certain business functions as of december 31 2003 there was 02 million remaining to be paid entirely related to facility costs to be paid through august 2006   amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation we amortize purchased intangible assets and deferred stock compensation over their estimated lives the following table shows the breakdown of the amortization expenses in thousands  the amortization expense of intangible assets increased 68 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the intangible assets purchased in the unisphere acquisition in july 2002 the amortization expense of intangible assets increased 112 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due to the intangible assets purchased in the unisphere acquisition in july 2002 and a full year of amortization of the intangible assets purchased in the pacific broadband communications “pacific broadband” acquisition in december 2001 the amortization expense of deferred stock compensation was 20 million in 2003 which included a credit as required by apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issue to employees” “apb 25” of approximately 56 million due to employees who forfeited options for which compensation expense had been recognized on the 22 graded vesting method but which were unvested on the date their employment was terminated a majority of these employees were a part of the restructuring plan in 2003 the amortization expense of deferred stock compensation was 04 million and 741 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively the primary reason for the decrease was a reversal as required by apb 25 of 335 million in previously recognized stock compensation expense this reversal related to the difference between the expense that had been previously recognized under the gradedvesting method for former employees and the expense that would have been recorded using the straightline method finally the decrease in expense is also a result of using the graded vesting method which expenses a larger percent in the earlier months   inprocess research and development in july 2002 we completed the acquisition of unisphere a subsidiary of siemens following the acquisition and during the remainder of 2002 siemens was one of our significant resellers the acquisition resulted in the payment of 3750 million cash and the issuance of 365 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately 3599 million to the former stockholders of unisphere we recorded goodwill of 7699 million purchased intangible assets of 740 million inprocess research and development “iprd” of 827 million and deferred compensation on unvested stock options of 05 million the intangibles assets other than goodwill are being amortized over their respective useful lives which we determined to be between two and six years in december 2001 we acquired pacific broadband and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting we allocated 42 million of the 1483 million purchase price as inprocess research and development we also originally recorded goodwill of 1273 million and other intangible assets of 102 million the intangibles assets have been completely amortized as of december 31 2003   integration we incurred integration expenses of approximately 25 million in the quarter ended september 30 2002 resulting from our acquisition of unisphere integration expenses are onetime incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies that have no go forward benefit the integration expenses consisted principally of workforce related expenses for individuals transitioning their positions and professional fees   amortization of goodwill there was no amortization of goodwill in 2003 and 2002 in accordance with sfas 142 amortization of goodwill was 466 million in 2001 from the micro magic inc acquisition which occurred in 2000   other income and expenses the following table shows other income and expenses for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 in thousands  interest and other income decreased 230 million in 2003 compared to 2002 the decrease was the result of lower cash and investment balances throughout 2003 as we spent 7920 million to retire a portion of our 475 convertible subordinated notes due march 15 2007 the “subordinated notes” 23 partially offset by the 3928 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of the zero coupon convertible senior notes due june 15 2008 the “senior notes” in addition interest rates were lower in 2003 as compared to 2002 interest and other income decreased 383 million in 2002 compared to 2001 the decrease was the result of lower cash and investment balances throughout 2002 as we spent 1460 million to retire a portion of the subordinated notes and 3758 million in the unisphere acquisition in addition interest rates were lower in 2002 as compared to 2001 interest and other expenses decreased 165 million in 2003 compared to 2002 and 58 million in 2002 compared to 2001 almost entirely due to interest saved from the partial retirement of the subordinated notes during each of the last two years during 2003 we paid 7920 million to retire and redeem a portion of the subordinated notes these subordinated notes had a cost basis of 8000 million the retirement resulted in a gain of 141 million and the redemption resulted in a loss of 152 million both of which was the difference between the carrying value of the subordinated notes at the time of their retirement including unamortized debt issuance costs and the amount paid to extinguish such notes in the quarter ended september 30 2002 we paid approximately 1460 million to retire a portion of the subordinated notes this partial retirement resulted in a gain of approximately 629 million which was the difference between the carrying value of the subordinated notes at the time of their retirement including unamortized debt issuance costs and the amount paid to extinguish such notes during the first and second quarters of 2003 we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as availableforsale which had a cost basis of 43 million and recognized gains of 87 million we have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost adjusted for any impairment as we own less than 20 of the voting equity and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies we wrotedown these investments 505 million and 536 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary there were no such writedowns in 2003 equity in net loss of joint venture decreased 28 million in 2002 compared with 2001 during the quarter ended june 30 2001 we entered into a joint venture agreement with ericsson ab through our respective subsidiaries to develop and market products for the wireless internet infrastructure market in addition to this joint venture ericsson is also one of our significant resellers representing greater than 10 of our revenues in 2003 2002 and 2001 as of december 31 2002 we had no further obligations to fund this joint venture   provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased to 198 million in 2003 from 45 million in 2002 the 2003 effective rate was 336 and reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions the benefit of research credits and capital loss carryforwards and the inability to benefit certain charges and losses provision for income taxes decreased to 45 million in 2002 from 300 million in 2001 the effective tax rates for 2002 and 2001 were 39 and 181 respectively the tax rates for 2002 and 2001 include the effects of writedowns in equity investments and acquisition related charges for goodwill and inprocess research and development which are nondeductible the irs is currently auditing the company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 proposed adjustments have not been received for these years management believes the ultimate outcome of the irs audits will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 24   liquidity and capital resources   overview we have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities the following table shows our capital resources in thousands  working capital decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the partial retirement of the subordinated notes offset by cash provided by operations and the issuance of common stock through employee stock option exercises and stock purchase plans the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and accounts receivable reduced by accounts payable accrued liabilities and deferred revenue based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months in addition there are no transactions arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources   cash requirements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands  as of december 31 2003 our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases the subordinated notes and the senior notes the contractual obligations under operating leases are primarily for our facilities interest is paid semiannually on march 15 and september 15 for the subordinated notes at an annual rate of 475 anytime we retire a portion of the subordinated notes the interest accrued on that portion is due the senior notes were issued in june 2003 and are senior unsecured obligations rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes including our subordinated notes the senior notes bear no interest but are convertible into shares of our common stock subject to certain conditions at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by juniper networks the conversion rate is 496512 shares per each 1000 principal amount of convertible notes subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 25 we do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply the contract manufacturers place noncancelable nonreturnable “ncnr” orders based on our build forecasts as of december 31 2003 there were ncnr orders valued at 625 million we do not take ownership of the components and the ncnr orders do not represent firm purchase commitments per our agreements with the contract manufacturers the components are used to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers the liability for products built by the contract manufacturer is recorded once they fulfill our customer’s order and the order ships if the components go unused there may be carrying charges or obsolete charges assessed as of december 31 2003 we had accrued 146 million for potential exposures with our contract manufacturers such as carrying and obsolete material charges   operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 1786 million 24 million and 2928 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the cash provided by operating activities for all periods was due to our net income in 2003 and net losses in 2002 and 2001 adjusted by ongoing noncash charges such as  unusual and significant adjustments to the net income for 2003 included  unusual and significant adjustments to the net losses in 2002 and 2001 include    investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was 3001 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and net cash used in investing activities was 2955 million and 3074 million for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively recurring investing activities included capital expenditures of 194 million 361 million and 2411 million respectively we reduced our capital expenditures over the past two years as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives we have also made investments in securities classified as availableforsale and sold investments to fund ongoing operations the partial retirement of the subordinated notes and the unisphere acquisition we have also made minority equity investments of 09 million 12 million and 82 million respectively in privately held companies unusual investing activities include i an increase of 308 million in restricted cash for the establishment of a trust to secure our indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers and the purchase of letters of credit to secure certain facility leases and ii 3758 million paid in 2002 related to the unisphere acquisition 26   financing activities net cash used in financing activities was 3075 million and 1194 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively net cash provided by financing activities was 585 million for the year ended december 31 2001 we received proceeds during all three years from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans we also received 3928 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in 2003 and paid 7920 million and 1460 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively to retire a portion of the subordinated notes   recent accounting pronouncements in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” “fin 46r” fin 46r clarifies the application of arb no 51 “consolidated financial statements” to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties including the equity holders fin 46r requires the consolidation of these entities known as variable interest entities “vies” by the primary beneficiary of the entity the primary beneficiary is the entity if any that will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both among other changes the revisions of fin 46r a clarified some requirements of the original fin 46 which had been issued in january 2003 b eased some implementation problems and c added new scope exceptions fin 46r deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies to the end of the first reporting period ending after march 15 2004 except that all public companies must at a minimum apply the unmodified provisions of the interpretation to entities that were previously considered “specialpurpose entities” in practice and under the fasb literature prior to the issuance of fin 46r by the end of the first reporting period ending after december 15 2003 among the scope exceptions companies are not required to apply fin 46r to an entity that meets the criteria to be considered a “business” as defined in the interpretation unless one or more of four named conditions exist fin 46r applies immediately to a vie created or acquired after january 31 2003 we do not have any interests in vies   factors that may affect future results   we face intense competition that could reduce our market share and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues competition in the network infrastructure market is intense this market has historically been dominated by cisco with other companies such as nortel networks and alcatel providing products to a smaller segment of the market in addition a number of other small public or private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors from a product offering standpoint or from potential price competition by such competitors we could experience a loss in market share andor be required to reduce prices resulting in reduced gross margins either of which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition   the fluctuating economic conditions combined with the financial condition of some of our customers make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results the recent economic downturn generally and in the telecommunication industry specifically combined with our own relatively limited operating history in the context of such a downturn makes it difficult to accurately forecast revenue 27 we have experienced and expect in the foreseeable future to continue to experience limited visibility into our customers’ spending plans and capital budgets this limited visibility complicates the revenue forecasting process additionally many customers funded their network infrastructure purchases through a variety of debt and similar instruments and many of these same customers are carrying a significant debt burden and are experiencing reduced cash flow with which to carry the cost of the debt and the corresponding interest charges which reduces their ability to both justify and make future purchases the telecommunications industry has experienced consolidation and rationalization of its participants and we expect this trend to continue there have been adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets for telecommunications industry participants which have affected their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures in some cases the significant debt burden carried by these customers has reduced their ability to pay for the purchases made to date this has contributed and we expect it to continue to contribute to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of capital expenditures further limiting visibility and complicating the forecasting process certain of these customers have filed for bankruptcy as a result of their debt burdens although these customers generally expect that they will emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings in the future a bankruptcy proceeding can be a slow and cumbersome process further limiting the visibility and complicating the revenue forecasting process as to these customers even if they should emerge from such proceedings the extent and timing of any future purchases of equipment is uncertain this uncertainty will further complicate the revenue forecasting process in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the shortterm if we do not achieve our expected revenues the operating results will be below our expectations and those of investors and market analysts which could cause the price of our common stock to decline   a limited numbers of customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on us even though our customer base has increased substantially we expect that a large portion of our net revenues will continue to depend on sales to a limited number of customers during 2003 ericsson and siemens each accounted for greater than 10 of net revenues ericsson was the only customer that accounted for greater than 10 of net revenues during 2002 any downturn in the business of these customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers that could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations   we rely on distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to these channels could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products we believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners we have entered into agreements with several value added resellers some of which also sell products that compete with our products we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain or attract resellers on a timely basis or at all or that the resellers will devote adequate resources to selling our products   any acquisition we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition if we are not able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or if expected benefits of the combination do not materialize we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments in order to enhance our business for example we recently entered into an agreement to acquire netscreen technologies inc in a stockforstock acquisition valued at approximately 4 billion at signing this transaction if consummated will dilute our existing stockholders’ percentage ownership in addition some of our results will be negatively impacted due to certain purchase accounting rules which will result in a writedown of netscreen’s deferred revenue and other purchase accounting adjustments further the failure to effectively manage the acquisition and integration of netscreen could disrupt our business and harm our financial results acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of management’s attention from our core business adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire 28 the integration of businesses that we have acquired into our business has been and will continue to be a complex time consuming and expensive process failure to operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication system operating procedures financial controls and human resources practices could adversely impact the success of any business combination for example although we completed the acquisition of unisphere networks on july 1 2002 integration of the products product roadmap and operations is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future as a result of these activities we may lose opportunities and employees which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results we also intend to make investments in complementary companies products or technologies in the event of any such investments or acquisitions we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership incur debt assume liabilities incur amortization expenses related to purchases of intangible assets or incur large and immediate writeoffs   our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software or hardware errors our business could be adversely impacted our products are highly technical and are designed to be deployed in very large and complex networks certain of our products can only be fully tested when deployed in networks that generate high amounts of ip traffic as a result we may experience errors in connection with such products and for new products and enhancements any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future could result in loss of or delay in revenue loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost any of which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations   if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software used in our customers’ networks we must modify our software to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks installations could be delayed orders for our products could be cancelled or our products could be returned this would also damage our reputation which could seriously harm our business and prospects   traditional telecommunications companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business traditional telecommunications companies because of their size generally have had greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that effect our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition in addition many of this class of customer have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality andor had products that caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers as a result this class of customer may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these 29 additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may affect our ability to recognize the revenue from such sales which may negatively affect our business and our financial condition   if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs or if those products do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer we cannot ensure that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or that we will be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner if we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business and financial results even if we are able to anticipate and develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance any failure of our future products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial results   our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering sales marketing and support personnel none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to develop market sell or support our products   if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs which would harm our results of operations or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business our contract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products for any specific period in any specific quantity or at any specific price except as may be provided in a particular purchase order because we do not have longterm supply contracts with them in addition lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and demand for each component at a given time we provide to our contract manufacturers a demand forecast if we overestimate our requirements the contract manufacturers may assess charges that could negatively impact our gross margins for example for the quarter ended september 30 2001 we recorded a charge for approximately 399 million associated with contractual liabilities and carrying charges on excess material at our contract manufacturers if we underestimate our requirements the contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues   we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components which make us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations with the current demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited we currently purchase several key components including asics from single or limited sources for example ibm is our asic supplier we may not be able to develop an alternate or second source in a timely manner which could hurt our ability to deliver product to customers if we are unable to buy these components on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers which would seriously impact present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business 30   we currently depend on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products we do not have a longterm supply contract with such manufacturers and if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed which could adversely affect our business and financial results   litigation regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute or defend therefore we may have to expend a substantial amount of resources to make our products noninfringing and may have to pay a substantial amount of money in damages third parties have and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us for example in 2003 toshiba corporation filed suit against us alleging that our products infringe certain toshiba patents the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation require us to develop noninfringing technologies or enter into license agreements furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant funds if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected   we are a party to lawsuits which if determined adversely to us could require us to pay damages which could harm our business and financial condition we and certain of our former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits there can be no assurance that actions that have been or will be brought against us will be resolved in our favor regardless of whether they are in our favor these lawsuits are and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party in the future will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow   the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter a customer’s decision to purchase our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy throughout the sales cycle we often spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers tend to deploy the products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customer’s network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we expect to receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 31   our products incorporate and rely upon licensed thirdparty technology and if licenses of thirdparty technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected we integrate licensed thirdparty technology in certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any third party licenses required in our current products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations   due to the global nature of our operations economic or social conditions or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our resellers in countries outside of the united states and also depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers that are located outside of the united states for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we derived approximately 58 and 45 of our revenues respectively from sales outside north america accordingly our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue costs expenses and financial condition   if our restructuring initiatives are not sufficient to meet industry and market conditions and to achieve future profitability we may undertake further restructuring initiatives which may adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition in response to industry and market conditions we have restructured our business and reduced our workforce the assumptions underlying our restructuring efforts will be assessed on an ongoing basis and may prove to be inaccurate and we may have to restructure our business again in the future to achieve certain cost savings and to strategically realign our resources while restructuring we have assessed and will continue to assess whether we should further reduce our workforce and facilities as well as review the recoverability of our tangible and intangible assets including the land purchased in january 2001 any such decisions may result in the recording of additional charges such as workforce reduction costs facilities reduction costs asset writedowns and contractual settlements additionally estimates and assumptions used in asset valuations are subject to uncertainties as are accounting estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets as a result future market conditions may result in further charges for the write down of tangible and intangible assets we may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in restructuring our business and even if successfully implemented these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions and to achieve future profitability furthermore our workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives lastly costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions andor may not lead to the anticipated cost savings   we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows 32 because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows the majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen hong kong dollar british pound and the euro related to our sale and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in us dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income   our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock our revenues operating results booktobill ratio and other financial indicators will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors including many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate the factors that may impact the unpredictability of our quarterly results include the reduced visibility into customers’ spending plans the changing market conditions which have resulted in some customer and potential customer bankruptcies a change in the mix of our products sold from higher priced core products to lower priced edge products and long sales and implementation cycle as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not a good indication of future performance it is likely that in some future quarters operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may fall   if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively impacted our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted   we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and if those networks and ip infrastructure do not continue to grow then our business operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services as a result of changes in the economy and capital spending which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on ip infrastructure can vary a significant reduction in such spending would adversely affect our business 33   regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry currently there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on data networks we could be adversely affected by regulation of those networks and commerce occurring on them in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using internet protocol encryption technology and access charges for service providers the adoption of such regulations could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

 item 1 business   overview we are a leading provider of network infrastructure solutions that transform the business of networking by converting bandwidth — a commodity — into a dependable secure and highly valuable corporate asset our products services and solutions enable service providers and other networkintensive businesses to support and deliver services and applications on a highly efficient and low cost integrated network our products are designed and purposebuilt for service provider networks and offer our customers bestinclass performance with less complexity and cost than legacy alternatives unlike conventional routers originally developed for enterprise applications and increasingly inadequate for use in the highly scaled public and private networks our products are specifically designed to accommodate substantial size scope and security demands we lead the industry in transforming packets into profit for network service providers wireless and cable operators government agencies research and education networks and informationintensive enterprises our acquisition of unisphere networks inc completed in july 2002 has enabled us to extend our ability to supply shared access applications expertise to the leading service providers carriers and ptts throughout the world we were incorporated in california in 1996 and reincorporated in delaware in 1997 with our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale california our corporate mailing address is 1194 north mathilda avenue sunnyvale california 94089 and the telephone number at that location is 408 7452000 our website is wwwjunipernet   industry background the internet has evolved from an academic research project into a network of hundreds of separately administered public and private networks interconnected using internet protocol ip ip traffic continues to grow driven by increasing numbers of new users connected devices and internet transactions the result of the widespread use of ip is a ubiquitous network that today carries a large and growing amount of data traffic enabling millions of users to share information and conduct electronic commerce industry research firms forecast continued growth worldwide in the internet and internet traffic the importance of ip continues to increase as the number of users connected devices and transactions over the highly scaled public and private networks increases the rapid adoption of the internet and the tremendous growth of ip traffic have prompted service providers to construct largescale data networks these highly scaled public and private networks are being optimized to transport data traffic as compared to traditional telephone networks which were 1 optimized to transport voice traffic the architecture of these next generation networks is being driven by two key technologies packetcell switching and optical networking   advantages of packetcell switching  packetcell switching technology which divides data traffic into distinct units called packets or cells and routes each packet or cell independently provides superior use of available network capacity compared to traditional circuit switching technology in a circuit switched network each data stream such as a voice telephone call between two points is provided with a dedicated channel or circuit for the duration of the telephone call this approach leads to inefficient use of network resources because a channel is fully dedicated to each transaction whether or not data is actually flowing at any given moment as a result circuit switched architecture is highly inefficient for internet applications which tend to create large bursts of data traffic followed by long periods of silence packetcell switching architectures enable greater utilization out of a fixed capacity circuit by combining traffic that has different capacity demands of the circuit at different times packetcell switches more efficiently fill the available network bandwidth with packets of data from many users thereby reducing the wasted bandwidth due to silence from any one particular user the use of packetcell switching is driving the architecture of the internet to be fundamentally different from traditional circuit switched voice based networks in packetcell switched networks ip has emerged as the de facto standard for providing services to end users other packetcell switching products include frame relay switches asynchronous transfer mode atm switches and routers   rapid advances in optical networking  optical networking technology uses pulses of light rather than pulses of electricity to transmit data in a network and uses fiber optic connections instead of wires optical networking can be used to transmit much more information over a given connection than electrical signals can convey optical networking advances such as dense wavelength division multiplexing or dwdm which allows transmission of several frequencies of light over one strand of optical fiber have enabled still higher data transmission rates and improved efficiency of bandwidth utilization packetcell technologies have not kept up with optical technologies and traditional packet switching equipment is not capable of forwarding packets at rates sufficient to keep pace with optical transmission speeds our ipbased products are purposebuilt to meet these requirements   fundamental requirements for highly scaled public and private networks the reliability and performance of current network infrastructure equipment have become and continue to be critical issues for service providers as they support dramatic growth in ip traffic and increasingly seek to offer new revenue generating missioncritical and other services the need for high reliability high performance high performance under stressful conditions scalability interoperability and cost effectiveness are fundamental requirements in meeting the needs associated with the growth in ip traffic new requirements will continue to arise for next generation networks which will drive a set of new requirements for network infrastructure equipment   high reliability  as businesses and consumers increasingly rely on the internet for missioncritical applications high network reliability becomes essential service providers are increasingly expected to provide a similar degree of reliability on the internet that users have become accustomed to on the traditional telephone network the “five nines” 99999 reliability standard of the traditional telephone network is becoming the target to which suppliers of nextgeneration internet platforms are being compared as service providers begin to bundle voice and data on their networks this high degree of reliability is becoming even more critical   high performance  to handle the rapid growth in ip traffic today’s networks increasingly require routers that can operate at higher speeds the processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated forwarding technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination based on priority data type and other considerations since a large number of ip packets many of which perform critical administrative functions are small in size high performance internet routers need to achieve their specified transmission speeds even for small packet sizes since smaller packets increase packet processing demands routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be more resource intensive than routing of larger packets a wire speed router which achieves its specified transmission rate for any type 2 of traffic passing through it can accomplish this task thus provisioning of missioncritical services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed processing   high performance under stressful conditions  in a large and complex network individual components inevitably fail however the failure of an individual device or link must not compromise the network as a whole in a typical network when a failure occurs the network loses some degree of capacity and in turn a greater load falls on the remaining network routers which must provide alternate routes routers must quickly adjust to the new state of the network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping significant numbers of packets when active routes are lost or when large numbers of routes change routing protocols are used to accomplish this convergence a process that places even greater stress on the router given the complexity of internet infrastructure particularly compared to enterprise networks the convergence process is far more complex and places a far greater load on the routing software thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device   scalability  due to the rapid growth in ip traffic service providers must continuously expand their networks both in terms of increased numbers of access points of presence pops and also greater capacity per pop to facilitate this expansion process network infrastructure equipment must be highly scalable next generation routers therefore need to be upgradeable and configurable to function within constantly changing networks while incurring minimal downtime   interoperability  service providers do not have the time or inclination to change their existing networks to favor introduction of new products rather new products must be compatible with the existing environment given the open and interconnected nature of the internet the complexity of running an internet backbone network requires a service provider to control and police relations with other service providers for example service providers must carefully control what traffic is accepted under what conditions from other providers the software in each router must offer 100 compatibility with the interior protocols and standards used within each service provider’s backbone network the compatibility level must be maintained despite changes to software equipment configuration and network architecture and upgrades to the various protocol standards thus routing software must be flexible and quickly upgradeable to support any necessary revisions this level of compatibility in turn cannot impact the performance scalability or reliability of the equipment attaining this sophisticated level of interoperability is highly challenging and requires significant testing to ensure compatibility   cost effectiveness  growth in ip traffic and intense price competition in the telecommunications market continues to require service providers to seek solutions that significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build and operate their networks in addition to the basic cost of equipment such as routers service providers incur substantial ancillary costs in terms of space required to deploy the equipment power consumption and ongoing operations and maintenance service providers therefore want to deploy dense and varied equipment configurations in limited amounts of rack and floor space therefore in order to continue to scale their networks toward higher data speeds in a cost effective manner service providers need the ability to mix and match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities without significantly increasing the consumption of space or power there is a clear need for next generation routers that can support high speeds and offer new ipbased services network operators are eagerly seeking new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within their networks and reduce the cost of their architectures   the juniper networks solution we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available purposebuilt internet backbone router optimized for the specific high performance needs of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created our products are designed to address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless and cable access by combining the features of highperformance asicbased packet forwarding technology our software and a networkoptimized architecture 3   software  our software has been designed to meet the ip network routing operations and control requirements of the world’s largest service providers and is an integral embedded component of our product family system architecture the ability of our software to manage the complex network sharing relationships among service providers allows our products to be placed at critical points in the core of a service provider’s network our software allows our products to have widespread network placement due to its interoperability with cisco’s internetwork operating system or ios currently the most broadly deployed routing operating system unconstrained by legacy routing software we developed our software using a modular design in which distinct functions are implemented as separate modules with well defined interfaces and interactions simplifying troubleshooting and maintenance these features keep functionality distinct and minimize the impact of any failure that may occur to the specific software application in which the failure occurs also we believe the modularity of our software will enable the continuous upgrade of new enhanced capabilities while protecting reliability and compatibility with existing networks   high performance asicbased packet forwarding technology  our products utilize high performance asicbased technology the result is a platform that is substantially faster than today’s general purpose microprocessor based routers in its ability to process and forward ip packets allowing our products to deliver high performance at wire speed the ability to enhance and implement large scale asics will be a longterm differentiator for us particularly as the sophistication required to forward traffic across higher speed networks increases   network optimized architecture  our products employ an architecture designed exclusively for the highly scaled public and private networks the system architecture provides a clean separation between the routing and packetforwarding functions separating these two functions enables us to develop independently a fullfeatured routing protocol and traffic engineering functionality through our software and wire speed packet forwarding performance through high performance asics   juniper networks products  our products have been developed or acquired as part of our strategy to provide the reliable delivery of core edge wireless and cable internet services at scale for the new public network as part of our product and services offerings our model for integrated network transformation mint provides a business and network framework that enable service providers to transition from a commodity transport business model to a more lucrative valueadded services model technologies such as ip routing multiprotocol label switching mpls and packet processing have been successfully deployed in a number of service provider networks for a number of years and have now been enhanced and matured to a degree that they can now be applied to solving issues such as the supply of new ip based services and consolidating legacy networks the mint provides an operational approach to apply the technologies appropriate to the revenue opportunities being presented to our customers the mint advocates a software based approach in the provision of services similar to the model that has proved to be successful in the telephony market it defines a new operational model for service providers to address the data communications market by  our mseries and tseries product platforms share common software and services and common family of asic technology for full compatibility and scalability critical service provider applications including highspeed access peering and hosting are served by our platforms physical interfaces are interchangeable between most platforms increasing user flexibility and

application sharing the jseries products can be integrated into an existing backbone network and the operator gains with ease of deployment and costofownership benefits through using the same infrastructure for gprswcdma and other types of ip access we sell the jseries products exclusively through our reseller ericsson the gseries products based on cablelabs® docsis™ 11 and interim packetcable specifications combine the cmts with our mseries routers allowing cable operators to efficiently deliver advanced ip services including voip through twoway cable plants and offer interoperability with call management servers media gateways billing and provisioning systems and multimedia terminal adapters the gseries products utilize a purposebuilt docsiscompliant integrated circuit – the broadband cable processor asic to allow cable operators to deliver more bandwidth for advanced ip services and with superior rf performance and thereby simultaneously supporting a higher number of cable modems and to lower capital expenses   the juniper networks strategy our objective and strategy is to transform the business of networking by converting bandwidth which is a commodity into a dependable secure and highly valuable corporate asset our technological leadership and problem solving abilities combined with our experience and fundamental understanding of high performance packet processing will help us in meeting our objectives key elements of our strategy are described below   maintain and extend technology leadership  our asic technology software and networkoptimized product architecture have been key elements to establishing our technology leadership we believe that these elements are highly leverageable into future products we are currently developing we intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the network infrastructure market through continued significant investment to enhance the feature richness of our products and to develop future differentiated offerings for service providers   leverage early lead as supplier of purposebuilt network infrastructure  from inception we have focused on designing and building network infrastructure for service providers and have integrated purposebuilt software and hardware into a network optimized architecture that specifically meets service 5 providers’ needs we believe that many of these customers will deploy network infrastructure equipment from only a few vendors the purposebuilt advantages of our products provide us with a timetomarket lead which is a critical advantage in gaining rapid penetration as one of these selected vendors once our products are widely deployed in a service provider’s network as the primary or even secondary network infrastructure equipment we believe we create a significant barrier to entry to potential competitors who do not currently offer commerciallyviable next generation routing solutions   work very closely with key customers  in developing our products including our software we worked very closely with customers to design and build a product specifically to meet their complex needs and over the last four years we have expanded our understanding of the challenges facing these carriers enabling us to subsequently design additional features and capabilities into both our software and hardware we believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date we plan to continue to work very closely with our key customers to implement enhancements to current products as well as to design future products that specifically meet their evolving needs we are also actively involved with these customers in developing key standards such as mpls and are an active participant in standards organizations such as the internet engineering task force and the optical internetworking forum   increase penetration at major service providers  our initial focus was to penetrate several of the largest service providers where operators have the technical sophistication resources and desire to test and evaluate our solution against potential alternatives we believe that there is a significant opportunity to further penetrate these large and complex networks given the advantages of our products   enable new ipbased services  our platform enables service providers to build networks cost effectively and to offer new differentiated services for their customers more efficiently than conventional products we believe that the delivery of ipbased services and applications including web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services vpns outsourced enterprise applications and voiceover ip will continue to grow and are costeffectively enabled by our network infrastructure solutions   technology our core technology consists of our backbone router architecture software and asic hardware expertise our generalpurpose architecture was initially embodied in the m40 but also is designed to serve as the platform for our future generations of core products we have products based on our mseries and tseries platforms our eseries platforms our jseries platform and our gseries platform our software offers a full suite of scalable internettested routing protocols protocols and software tools which are used to control and direct network traffic are critical to a network routing solution software control is made more important by the fact that the size and complexity of backbone networks are increasing at a time when service providers are looking to differentiate themselves through valueadded service offerings   customers our customers include end users and value added resellers we recognize revenue from the shipment of products at the time of shipment unless we have future obligations for network interoperability or if we have to obtain customer acceptance in those cases we defer recognition of the revenue and related costs until we have met our obligations ericsson accounted for approximately 17 of our recognized product revenues for the year ended december 31 2002   sales and marketing we sell and market our products primarily through our direct sales organization and valueadded resellers 6   direct sales  our north american direct sales organization is divided into regional operations with our direct sales efforts focused on the largest service providers the direct sales account managers cover the market on an assigned account basis and work as a team with account oriented systems engineers they are directed by a regional operations manager who reports to the north american vice president of sales we also have technical engineers that consult with and provide our customers with guidance and assistance on the evolution of their networks as it relates to the deployment of our products these consulting engineers also help in defining the features that are required for our products to be successful in specific applications a key feature of our sales effort is the relationship we establish at various levels in our customers’ organization our sales team maintains contact with key individuals who have service planning and infrastructure buildout responsibility   value added resellers  we have complemented our direct sales effort in the united states through the addition of several highly focused value added resellers our arrangements with value added resellers typically have been nonexclusive and provide the value added reseller with discounts based upon the volume of their orders   strategic distribution relationships  we have established a strategic distribution relationship with both ericsson ab and siemens ag we believe that both ericsson and siemens have significant customer relationships in place and offer products that complement ours our agreements with ericsson and siemens allow them to distribute our products on a worldwide nonexclusive basis with discounts based upon the volume ericsson and siemens provide the first level of support to its customers   international resellers  we have established in addition to ericsson and siemens strategic value added reseller relationships with nortel and alcatel to sell and service our products on a worldwide nonexclusive basis to further our international sales objectives we also have established a number of country specific value added resellers these resellers have expertise in deploying complex network infrastructure equipment in their respective markets and provide the first level of support required by our international customers as of december 31 2002 we employed 410 people in our sales and marketing organizations   customer service and support we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful installation and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services we offer the following services 24 hours a day seven days a week technical assistance online telephone and onsite professional services educational services logistics services and webbased information we offer a variety of flexible and comprehensive support programs including basic hardware and software warranty services next day onsite parts and labor 24 hours a day seven days a week same day parts and labor and onsite resident engineers we deliver these services directly to major end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our partners and third party organizations we also train our partners in the delivery of education and support services customer service and support provide front line product support and is the problem resolution interface to our partners and direct end users if customer service and support are unable to resolve an issue themselves they duplicate the problem scenario and provide the failure information such as logs traces and system configuration to appropriate subject matter experts in our engineering department based on the severity of the problem and the impact to our customers’ network there are strict escalation guidelines to ensure that the appropriate technical resources and management attention is brought to bear on the problem in a timeframe commensurate with problem priority the overall goal is to fix the problem at the appropriate level in the right timeframe in order to ensure our customers’ satisfaction 7 as of december 31 2002 we employed 165 people in our worldwide customer service and support organization   research and development we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of high end computing network system design internet routing protocols and embedded software these individuals have been drawn from leading computer data networking and telecommunications companies in addition to building complex hardware and software systems the engineering team has experience in delivering very large highly integrated asics and extremely scalable software we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings we are leveraging our third generation asics developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customer applications and continuing to develop next generation technology to support the anticipated growth in network bandwidth requirements we continue to expand the functionality of our software to improve performance and scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface our research and development process is driven by the availability of new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for undertaking all product development projects this process involves all functional groups and all levels within our company following an assessment of market demand our research and development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market as of december 31 2002 we employed 704 people in our research and development organization our research and development expenses totaled 1619 million for the year ended december 31 2002 1555 million for the year ended december 31 2001 and 878 million for the year ended december 31 2000   manufacturing our manufacturing operation is outsourced we currently have manufacturing relationships with solectron celestica and plexus under which we have subcontracted our manufacturing activity this subcontracting activity extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material procurement final assembly test control and shipment to our customers we design specify and monitor all of the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following benefits  our asics are manufactured by ibm who is responsible for all aspects of the production of the asics using our proprietary designs 8   competition competition in the network infrastructure market is intense cisco systems inc has historically dominated the market with other companies such as nortel networks and lucent technologies inc providing products to a smaller segment of the market in addition a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same problems that our products address cisco traditionally has been the dominant supplier of solutions to this market we believe this is the result of its early leadership position in the enterprise router market as both large public and private networks and traffic over the internet has grown rapidly cisco has leveraged this position and has developed a broad product line of routers that support all major local area and wide area interfaces we believe that our ability to compete with cisco depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of service providers and are extremely compatible with cisco’s current and future products although we believe that we are currently among the top providers of network infrastructure solutions worldwide we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with cisco currently the leading provider in this market we expect that over time large companies with significant resources technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product lines such as lucent and nortel will introduce new products which are designed to compete more effectively in this market as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be successful many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco lucent and nortel have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products also many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged increased competition could result in price reduction fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could seriously harm our operating results there are also many small public and private companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products consolidation in this industry has begun with one or more of these smaller private companies being acquired by large established suppliers of network infrastructure products and we believe it is likely to continue as a result we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have several companies also provide solutions that can substitute for some uses of routers for example high bandwidth atm switches are used in the core of certain major backbone service providers atm switches can carry a variety of traffic types including voice video and data using fixed 53 byte cells companies that use atm switches are enhancing their products with new software technologies such as mpls which can potentially simplify the task of mixing routers and switches in the same network these substitutes can reduce the need for large numbers of routers   intellectual property our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and knowhow our engineering teams have significant expertise in asic design and we own all rights to the design of the asics which form the core of our products our software was developed internally and is protected by united states and other copyright laws while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product 9 developments frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights while we have filed patent applications we cannot be certain that these applications will issue into patents that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights   employees as of december 31 2002 we had 1542 fulltime employees 704 of whom were engaged in research and development 410 in sales and marketing 165 in customer service and 263 in finance administration it and operations none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of who is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future   available information we file our annual reports on

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to sales returns warranty costs allowance for doubtful accounts impairment of longterm assets especially goodwill and intangibles contract manufacturer exposures for excess and obsolete material and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   overview juniper networks inc “juniper networks” or “we” was founded in 1996 to develop and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of service providers the world’s leading network operators government agencies research and education institutions and information intensive enterprises now rely upon us as the foundation for uncompromising networks 13   critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these policies include  we have other equally important accounting policies and practices however once adopted these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy not a judgment as to policy itself despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions actual results could differ from those estimates   revenue recognition we recognize product revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” specifically product revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured unless we have future obligations for such things as network interoperability or customer acceptance in which case revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met in most cases we recognize product revenue upon shipment to our customers including resellers as it is our policy to ensure an end user has been identified prior to shipment our ability to recognize revenue in the future will be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers and by our assessment of collectibility we assess the probability of collection by reviewing our customers’ payment history financial condition and credit report if the probability of collection is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the payment is collected the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also impacted by our judgments taken in establishing our reserve for potential future product returns although our arrangements do not include any contractual rights of return and our general policy is that we do not accept returns under unique circumstances we have and may in the future accept product returns from our customers therefore we do provide a reserve for our estimate of future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is recorded our estimate of future returns is based on such factors as historical return data and current economic condition of our customer base in addition we get input from our sales and support organizations with respect to specific customer issues the amount of revenue we recognize going forward will be directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for potential future product returns   allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen our reserves have historically been 14 adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers or the industries that we sell to we cannot guarantee that our current level of reserves will continue to be adequate if actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established that would increase our general and administrative expenses conversely if actual credit losses were to be significantly less than our reserves our general and administrative expenses would decrease   contract manufacturer exposures we outsource the majority of our manufacturing repair operations and supply chain management operations to our three independent contract manufacturers accordingly a significant portion of the cost of revenues consists of payments to them our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture products based on build forecasts we provide them our forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products our estimates of future demand for our products are based on historical trends and a bottomsup analysis from our sales and support organizations adjusted for overall market conditions if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast we have contractual liabilities and exposures with all of the contract manufacturers such as carrying costs and excess material exposures which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability the majority of the factors that affect component usage and demand for our products are outside of our control   warranty reserves we offer a oneyear warranty on all of our hardware products as well as a 90day warranty on the software embedded in the products the warranty generally includes parts labor and 24hour service center support the specific terms and conditions of those warranties may vary depending on the products sold and the locations into which they are sold we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and record a liability and charge to cost of product sales in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary if actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast our gross margins could be adversely affected   valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill and purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization we adopted sfas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” on january 1 2002 sfas 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for business combinations consummated before july 1 2001 goodwill was amortized through december 31 2001 using the straightline method over an estimated useful life of three years goodwill is not amortized for business combinations consummated after june 30 2001 amortization of purchased intangibles is computed using the straightline method over the related expected useful lives of between two and six years when valuing goodwill and purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment we estimate future cash flows and useful lives these estimates include discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology or other identified intangibles is associated and the periods of time with which the products will be in demand we perform goodwill impairment tests annually and on an interim basis in certain circumstances we performed an impairment analysis as of january 1 2002 and again in november 2002 and determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill at either time in addition we review each purchased intangible asset quarterly and assess if the amortization period is still appropriate any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects or changes in market conditions or other externalities could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 15   unisphere business combination in july 2002 we completed our acquisition of unisphere networks inc “unisphere” a subsidiary of siemens corporation which is a subsidiary of siemens ag “siemens” following the acquisition and during the remainder of 2002 siemens itself and through its local country affiliates was one of our significant resellers unisphere developed manufactured and sold data networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider networks in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” we have included in our results of operations for 2002 the results of unisphere from july 1 2002 the unisphere acquisition resulted in significant impacts to revenue cost of revenues and all operating expenses for the second half of 2002 the results for 2003 will include a full year of results of the combined companies   results of operations   net revenues the following table shows product and service net revenues for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 in thousands  product net revenues decreased 3632 million in 2002 compared with 2001 our net product revenues for 2002 were derived from the sale of all of our products from 2001 plus from the sale of the following new products  the decrease in product net revenues in 2002 compared with 2001 was due primarily to a decrease in the demand for our products that resulted from the generally unfavorable economic conditions throughout 2002 the decrease was also due to lower average selling prices as a result of a shift in product mix for 2002 one customer accounted for 17 of net product revenues compared to 2001 where three customers each accounted for 14 13 and 11 of net product revenues product net revenues increased 1696 million in 2001 compared with 2000 three of our five product platforms available during 2001 m160 m5 and m10 were introduced during 2000 with the first full year of shipments for these products occurring in 2001 resulting in an increase in net revenues for 2001 compared to 2000 the increase in product net revenues was also the result of the continuing increase in market acceptance of our products and especially in early 2001 the overall growth in the marketplace due to the growth of data traffic on the internet and an increase in the number of customers and networks one customer accounted for 18 of net product revenues in 2000 service net revenues increased 228 million in 2002 compared with 2001 service net revenues increased as a result of a larger installed base of customers and products a vast majority of service 16 revenue is from customers who previously purchased our products and enter into a service contract in addition to service contracts service revenue is generated from providing professional and educational services service contracts are typically for oneyear periods and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period service net revenues increased 439 million in 2001 compared with 2000 the increase in service net revenues was primarily the result of a larger installed base of customers and products resulting from the continuing increase in market acceptance of our products and especially in early 2001 the overall growth in the marketplace due to the growth of data traffic on the internet and an increase in the number of customers and networks the following table shows net revenue and the percent of total net revenues by geographic region  we experienced a shift in net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues from the americas region to europe and asia in 2002 as the capital spending market in the united states declined   cost of revenues the following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin percentages for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 in thousands  our gross margins are highly variable and dependent on many factors some of which are outside of our control we have outsourced the majority of our manufacturing repair operations and supply chain management operations accordingly a significant portion of the cost of revenues consists of payments to our three independent contract manufacturers the independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products using quality assurance programs and standards that we established controls around manufacturing engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale california and westford massachusetts our independent contract manufacturers have facilities in milpitas california neenah wisconsin and toronto canada as of december 31 2002 two of our contract manufacturers retained title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract manufacturer’s facility as of december 31 2002 the third contract manufacturer retained title until title is transferred to our customers upon shipment from our westford facility where the contract manufacturer performs final configuration assembly testing and packaging as of january 31 2003 the third contract manufacturer performs all manufacturing and final configuration assembly testing and packaging at its facilities and retains title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take title upon shipment from the contract manufacturer’s facility as of december 31 2002 we had inventory valued at 14 million located at our westford facility included in other current assets cost of product revenues decreased 1392 million in 2002 compared with 2001 the decrease in absolute dollars was directly related to the decrease in product revenue which was primarily a result of 17 unfavorable economic conditions many customers experienced throughout 2002 as well as to a 2001 charge of 399 million for excess materials exposure with our contract manufacturers no significant such charges were recorded in 2002 for materials exposure matters but in accordance with the purchase accounting rules of sfas 141 we did recognize onetime charges of 51 million in 2002 relating to the unisphere acquisition the charge of 51 million included 36 million for backlog orders and 15 million for an inventory writeup adjustment product gross margins were flat as a result of operational costs being cut as the demand for our products decreased we did not utilize any previously reserved inventory in 2002 we expect our product gross margins to slightly increase in 2003 as compared to 2002 cost of product revenues increased 1123 million in 2001 compared with 2000 the increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to the increase in product net revenues as well as head count increases in our manufacturing support organizations in addition in 2001 we incurred a charge of 399 million relating to an excess materials exposure with our contract manufacturers the decrease in product gross margins was primarily a result of costs in our manufacturing support organizations increasing more than our product revenues as we originally intended to increase the size of the organization to meet future demand however as the economy weakened in 2001 the expected demand did not materialize in addition the excess materials charge of 399 million negatively impacted the 2001 gross margin as compared to 2000 cost of service revenues decreased 34 million in 2002 compared with 2001 the decrease in absolute dollars and increase in service gross margins were primarily due to realized savings in our service organization for personnel and other related costs associated with our restructuring activities while service revenue increased as a result of a larger installed base of customers and products the increase in gross margin reflects the benefits of increased service revenues and a more appropriately sized service organization for our current level of operations we expect our service gross margins to increase in 2003 as compared to 2002 cost of service revenues increased 229 million in 2001 compared with 2000 the increase in absolute dollars is primarily related to the increase in service contracts which necessitated headcount increases in our service organization the increase in gross margins was primarily a result of the service organization being built in 2000 to meet anticipated future demand   research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the following table shows research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 in thousands  the 64 million increase in research and development expenses in 2002 compared with 2001 was primarily a result of an increase in headcount related expenses the use of outside services and certain overhead costs partially offset by savings in prototype equipment headcount related expenses and overhead costs increased primarily due to the unisphere acquisition we realized savings in internally developed and prototype equipment expense during 2002 because throughout 2001 we were preparing for the release of our highend t series products as well as certain mseries and jseries products and developing and testing our application specific integrated circuits asics 18 the 677 million increase in research and development expenses in 2001 compared with 2000 was primarily related to increased salary and related personnel costs as we increased headcount to expand development efforts in new products such as t320 t640 m40e and j20 we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses for example a large number of prototypes are required to build and test our products and the building and testing process occurs over a short period of time our asic development requires a payment for nonrecurring engineering charges at the beginning of the process to design and develop the asic we expense such charges immediately in addition per unit costs are payable when we purchase the prototype asics with several large asics in our architecture we will incur large nonrecurring engineering and prototype expenses with each significant enhancement of the existing products and for any new product development we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading technology and meet the changing requirements of our customers we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel although we may experience significant quarterly variability in our research and development expenses we expect our annual research and development expenses to be flat to slightly increase in absolute dollars in the next year the 136 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2002 compared with 2001 was a result of decreases in employee and partner events the reduced use of demonstration equipment which is expensed immediately and consolidation of excess facilities to date we have not incurred significant advertising expenses the 514 million increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2001 compared with 2000 was primarily attributable to salaries commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales marketing and customer engineering support functions as we increased headcount during the year in addition costs associated with promotional and other marketing activities such as product launches and equipment for demonstration and competitive labs contributed to the increase in 2001 we intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers worldwide we believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and expect these expenses to slightly increase in absolute dollars in the next year as we initiate additional sales and marketing programs to support our products general and administrative expenses decreased 33 million in 2002 compared with 2001 general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive finance accounting and human resources personnel as well as recruiting expenses professional fees bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses the decrease was due to savings in headcount related expenses and decreases in the use of outside services we expect that general and administrative expenses will slightly decrease in 2003 as compared to 2002 general and administrative expenses increased 164 million in 2001 compared with 2000 the increase was primarily attributable to the costs associated with additional headcount to support increased levels of business activity as well as increases in the bad debt provision   other operating expenses the following table shows other operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 in thousands 19  in july 2002 we completed the acquisition of unisphere a subsidiary of siemens following the acquisition and during the remainder of 2002 siemens was one of our significant resellers the acquisition resulted in the payment of 3750 million cash and the issuance of 365 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately 3599 million to the former stockholders of unisphere we accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas 141 accordingly we originally recorded goodwill of 7699 million purchased intangible assets of 740 million inprocess research and development “iprd” of 827 million and deferred compensation on unvested stock options of 05 million in accordance with sfas no 142 “sfas 142” “goodwill and other intangible assets” the goodwill is not amortized but rather we are required to test the goodwill for impairment at least annually and at interim periods if necessary the purchased intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives generally between two and six years the deferred compensation is being amortized over four years using the gradedvesting method in december 2002 we adjusted the originally recorded goodwill of 7699 by decreasing it by 28 million primarily related to the valuation of certain assets where we were awaiting further information when we originally allocated the purchase price the purchase price allocation depicted is preliminary and subject to change as we continue to obtain additional information concerning the fair values of certain liabilities of unisphere in december 2001 and 2000 we acquired pacific broadband communications “pacific broadband” and micro magic inc “micro magic” respectively we accounted for both of these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting accordingly we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of 1375 million and 1257 million respectively representing the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired the goodwill and other intangibles were being amortized over their respective useful lives which we determined to be between two and three years in accordance with sfas 142 there was no goodwill amortization related to the pacific broadband acquisition in 2001 and beginning on january 1 2002 we no longer amortized goodwill relating to the micro magic acquisition during 2002 goodwill from the pacific broadband business combination increased as a result of the earnout provisions of the acquisition agreement and decreased for certain liabilities that were accrued for at the time of acquisition that were not realized neither of these transactions had an impact on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 there was no amortization of goodwill in 2002 in accordance with sfas 142 amortization of goodwill increased 359 million in 2001 compared with 2000 the increase was a result of a full year of amortization of goodwill from the micro magic inc acquisition amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation decreased 625 million in 2002 compared with 2001 amortization of purchased intangibles was 139 million and 27 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase was due to the acquisition of unisphere which contributed 73 million in amortization of purchased intangibles during the second half of 2002 and a full year of amortization during 2002 from the pacific broadband acquisition amortization of deferred stock compensation was 04 million and 741 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively the primary reason for the decrease was a reversal as required by apb 25 of 335 million in previously recognized stock compensation expense this reversal related to the difference between the expense that had been 20 previously recognized under the gradedvesting method for former employees and the expense that would have been recorded using the straightline method finally the decrease in expense is also a result of using the graded vesting method which expenses a larger percent in the earlier months amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation increased 636 million in 2001 compared with 2000 the increase was almost entirely due to a full year of amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation from the micro magic acquisition the amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation will increase in 2003 as a result of a full year of amortization of purchased intangible assets acquired from unisphere and may increase further in the future if we make other acquisitions of companies or technologies during the third quarter of 2002 in connection with the acquisition of unisphere we approved and initiated plans to restructure the operations to eliminate certain duplicative activities focus on strategic product and customer bases reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions consequently we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately 149 million net of a 26 million adjustment for costs that were not going to be incurred due to a change in estimate associated primarily with workforce related costs costs of vacating duplicative facilities contract termination costs noninventory asset impairment charges and other associated costs these costs are accounted for under eitf issue no 943 “eitf 943” “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity” and have been included as a charge to the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 we also recognized a charge of approximately 53 million during the quarter ended september 30 2002 related to the land acquired in january 2001 located in sunnyvale california the charge was primarily for costs of exiting certain contractual obligations associated with the land we currently have no plans to continue developing the land in the foreseeable future the carrying value of the land increased 23 million during 2002 primarily due to certain development costs incurred in the first half of 2002 in june 2001 we announced a restructuring program in an effort to better align our business operations with the current market and service provider industry conditions the restructuring program included a worldwide workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities and restructuring of certain business functions the costs associated with the restructuring program totaled 123 million and were recorded during the three months ended june 30 2001 as operating expenses restructuring and other costs increased 79 million in 2002 compared with 2001 this increase was a result of the restructuring activities and land charge in the third quarter of 2002 of the total unisphere purchase price approximately 827 million has been allocated to inprocess research and development “iprd” and was expensed in the quarter ended september 30 2002 projects that qualify as iprd represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a betaphase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development at the time of acquisition unisphere had multiple iprd efforts under way for certain current and future product lines these efforts included developing new cards and modules for different bandwidths and various software developments we utilized the discounted cash flow “dcf” method to value the iprd using rates ranging from 30 to 35 in applying the dcf method the value of the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated over the remaining economic life of the technology to distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets working capital and other assets that provide value to the product lines at the time of acquisition it was estimated that these development efforts were 55 complete and would be completed over the next six to twelve months as of december 31 2002 these development efforts were 90 complete and estimate that they will be completed over the next twelve months 21 in connection with the acquisition of pacific broadband in december 2001 we allocated 42 million of the 1483 million purchase price as iprd the applications from the inprocess technology project have been integrated into our products the efforts required to complete the acquired inprocess technology included the completion of all planning designing and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design requirements including functions features and technical performance requirements the value of the acquired inprocess technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis rate of 30 on the anticipated income stream of the related product revenues the discounted cash flow analysis was based on management’s forecast of future revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses related to the products and technologies purchased from pacific broadband the calculation of value was then adjusted to reflect only the value creation efforts of pacific broadband prior to the close of the acquisition at the time of the acquisition the product was approximately 75 complete the majority of the costs to complete the project was incurred in fiscal 2002 and was not material the resultant value of inprocess technology was further reduced by the estimated value of core technology and was expensed in the period the transaction was consummated the project was complete as of december 31 2002 in connection with the acquisition of micro magic in december 2000 we allocated 100 million of the 2593 million purchase price as iprd the applications from the inprocess technology project have been integrated within our engineering department the efforts required to complete the acquired inprocess technology included the completion of all planning designing and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design requirements including functions features and technical performance requirements the value of the acquired inprocess technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis rate of 19 on the anticipated income stream of the related product revenues the discounted cash flow analysis was based on management’s forecast of future revenues cost of revenues and operating expenses related to the products and technologies purchased from micro magic the calculation of value was then adjusted to reflect only the value creation efforts of micro magic prior to the close of the acquisition at the time of the acquisition the product was approximately 88 complete and the project was completed in 2001 the resultant value of inprocess technology was further reduced by the estimated value of core technology and was expensed in the period the transaction was consummated we incurred integration expenses of approximately 25 million in the quarter ended september 30 2002 resulting from our acquisition of unisphere integration expenses are onetime incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies that have no go forward benefit which consisted principally of workforce related expenses for individuals transitioning their positions and professional fees during the quarter ended september 30 2002 we expect that all of the integration costs relating to the unisphere integration have been incurred and that there will be no additional integration costs in the future related to unisphere there were charitable contributions of 100 million in 2000 in connection with common stock issued to a charitable foundation we have not made any similar contributions in 2002 or 2001 and we currently do not expect to make similar contributions in the foreseeable future   other income and expenses the following table shows other income and expenses for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 in thousands  22 interest income decreased 383 million in 2002 compared with 2001 the decrease was the result of lower cash and investment balances throughout 2002 as we spent 1460 million to retire a portion of our convertible subordinated notes and 3750 million in the unisphere acquisition in addition interest rates were lower in 2002 as compared to 2001 interest income increased 58 million in 2001 compared with 2000 the increase was the result of larger cash and investment balances throughout 2001 partially offset by a decline in interest rates interest expense decreased 58 million in 2002 compared with 2001 namely due to less interest being owed as a result of the retirement of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes during the quarter ended september 30 2002 interest expense increased 133 million in 2001 compared with 2000 the increase was due to a full year of interest incurred in 2001 on our convertible subordinated notes these notes were issued in march 2000 equity in net loss of joint venture decreased 28 million in 2002 compared with 2001 during the quarter ended june 30 2001 we entered into a joint venture agreement with ericsson ab through our respective subsidiaries to develop and market products for the wireless internet infrastructure market accordingly we began recording our 40 share of the joint venture’s loss during 2002 our share of the joint venture’s loss totaled approximately 13 million to date we have funded the joint venture in the amount of 54 million in addition to this joint venture ericsson is also one of our significant resellers representing greater than 10 of our revenues in 2002 and 2001 as of december 31 2002 we have no further obligations to fund this joint venture in the quarter ended september 30 2002 we paid approximately 1460 million to retire a portion of our 475 convertible subordinated notes due march 15 2007 the “notes” this partial retirement resulted in a gain of approximately 629 million which was the difference between the carrying value of the notes including unamortized debt issuance costs at the time of their retirement and the amount paid to extinguish such notes we are currently evaluating plans to retire additional notes in the future therefore we do not consider the gains associated with this repurchase to be extraordinary based on the guidance in sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections”   provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased to 45 million in 2002 from 300 million in 2001 the effective tax rates for 2002 and 2001 were 39 and 181 respectively the tax rates for 2002 and 2001 include the effects of writedowns in equity investments and acquisition related charges for goodwill and inprocess research and development which are nondeductible provision for income taxes decreased to 300 million in 2001 from 825 million in 2000 in 2000 we recorded tax provisions of 825 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 36 the irs is currently auditing the company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 proposed adjustments have not been received for these years management believes the ultimate outcome of the irs audits will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations   liquidity and capital resources we have funded our business by selling our common stock in the public market issuing convertible subordinated notes and through our operating activities at december 31 2002 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1944 million shortterm investments of 3840 million and longterm investments of 5837 million we regularly invest excess funds in money 23 market funds commercial paper and government and nongovernment debt securities with maturities of up to five years net cash provided by operating activities was 24 million 2928 million and 2691 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively net cash provided by operating activities during 2002 was due to the net loss of 1197 million offset by noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization expense inprocess research and development charges from the unisphere acquisition impairment of minority equity investments increases in accounts receivable a gain on retirement of convertible subordinated notes and decreases in other accrued liabilities net cash provided by operating activities in 2001 were primarily attributed to noncash charges such as amortization of goodwill purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation writedown of minority investments depreciation and a tax benefit from employee stock option plans as well as decreases in accounts receivable offset by cash used in operating activities in 2001 consisting of net decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities excluding the impact of acquisitions a net loss and decreases in accrued warranty net cash provided by operating activities in 2000 was primarily attributed to the net income increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities a tax benefit from employee stock option plans and noncash charges such as amortization of goodwill purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation offset by cash used in operating activities in 2000 consisting of increases in accounts receivable and other assets cash used in investing activities was 2955 million 3074 million and 8942 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively cash used during all periods was due to the purchase of capital equipment and availableforsale investments offset by maturities of availableforsale investments in addition we used cash in 2002 for the unisphere acquisition during 2001 the increase in fixed assets included the purchase of approximately 80 acres of land in sunnyvale california cash used in financing activities was 1194 million in 2002 compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2001 and 2000 of 585 million and 103 billion respectively cash used in financing activities in 2002 consisted of 1460 million spent to retire a portion of the notes offset by 266 million received from issuance of common stock as a result of employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock namely through employee option exercises cash provided by financing activities in 2000 was due to 11 billion received from the issuance of the notes and 367 million from the issuance of common stock namely through employee option exercises cash provided by financing activities in 2000 was offset by expenditures of 1300 million to repurchase outstanding common stock as of december 31 2002 our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases firm purchase commitments with our independent contract manufacturers and notes we have potential contractual liabilities and exposures to all of the independent contract manufacturers such as carrying costs and excess material exposures in the event that they procure components and build products based on our build forecasts and the actual component usage and product sales are significantly lower than forecast as of december 31 2002 we had accrued 278 million for potential exposures with our contract manufacturers such as carrying costs and excess material the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31 2002 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands  24 although we believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing within this time frame or that such additional funding if needed will be available on acceptable terms   recent accounting pronouncements in july 2002 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity” sfas no 146 revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” by spreading out the reporting of expenses related to restructuring activities a commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of longlived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a onetime charge for most restructuring activities instead companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are “incurred” and can be measured at fair value in addition the resultant liabilities will be subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows sfas no 146 is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of sfas no 146 and liabilities that a company previously recorded under eitf issue 943 are grandfathered we adopted sfas no 146 on january 1 2003 if we enter into any restructuring activities in the future the adoption of sfas 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amount recognized under such costs in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation “fin” no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value which is different from current practice where a liability is recorded when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable in addition fin 45 also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote which is another change from current practice fin 45 is applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december 15 2002 we have adopted the disclosure requirements in fin 45 regarding warranties herein this annual report see note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we are currently evaluating the other requirements of fin 45 if it is determined that the other requirements of fin 45 apply to us revenues cost of goods sold and or operating expenses could be negatively affected in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” sfas 148 amends sfas 123 to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas 123’s fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation sfas 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas 123 and apb no 28 “interim financial reporting” to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to stockbased employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements while sfas 148 does not amend sfas 123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method the disclosure provisions of sfas 148 are applicable to all companies with stockbased employee compensation regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas 123 or the intrinsic value method of apb 25 since we account for our stockbased compensation under apb 25 and have no current plans on switching to sfas 123 the impact of sfas 148 will be limited to the annual and interim reporting of the effects on net income and earnings per share as if we accounted for stockbased compensation under sfas 123 sfas 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46” an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 51 “consolidated financial statements” fin 46 establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity “vie” formerly referred to as special purpose entities fin 46 applies to any business enterprise both public and private that has a controlling interest contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie fin 46 provides guidance for determining when an entity the “primary beneficiary” should consolidate another entity a vie that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary we 25 currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie and therefore the adoption will not have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations   risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report   we face intense competition that could reduce our market share competition in the network infrastructure market is intense this market has historically been dominated by cisco with other companies such as nortel networks and lucent technologies providing products to a smaller segment of the market in addition a number of other small public or private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors from a product offering standpoint or from potential price competition by such competitors we could experience a loss in market share andor be required to reduce prices resulting in reduced gross margins either of which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition   the current economic conditions combined with the financial condition of some of our customers limit our visibility and makes revenue forecasting difficult the continuing economic downturn generally and in the telecommunication industry specifically combined with our own relatively limited operating history in the context of such a continuing economic downturn makes it difficult to accurately forecast revenue we have experienced and expect in the foreseeable future to continue to experience limited visibility into our customers’ spending plans and capital budgets this limited visibility complicates our revenue forecasting process additionally many customers funded their network infrastructure purchases through a variety of debt and similar instruments and many of these same customers are carrying a significant debt burden and are experiencing reduced cash flow with which to carry the cost of the debt and the corresponding interest charges which reduces their ability to both justify and make future purchases the telecommunications industry has experienced consolidation and rationalization of its participants and we expect this trend to continue there have been adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets for telecommunications industry participants which have affected their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures in some cases the significant debt burden carried by these customers has reduced their ability to pay for the purchases made to date this has contributed and we expect it to continue to contribute to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of capital expenditures further limiting visibility and complicating the forecasting process certain of these customers have filed for bankruptcy as a result of their debt burdens although these customers generally expect that they will emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings in the future a bankruptcy proceeding can be a slow and cumbersome process further limiting the visibility and complicating the revenue forecasting process as to these customers even if they should emerge from such proceedings the extent and timing of any future purchases of equipment is uncertain this uncertainty will further complicate the revenue forecasting process in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the shortterm if we do not achieve our expected revenues the operating results will be below our expectations and those of investors and market analysts which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 26   our failure to increase our revenues may prevent us from being profitable in future periods we have large fixed expenses and net revenues have declined over the past year there can be no assurances that net revenues will grow or that we will be profitable in future periods   although our customer base has increased substantially there are still a limited number of customers who comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect even though our customer base has increased substantially we expect that a large portion of our net revenues will continue to depend on sales to a limited number of customers any downturn in the business of these customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers that could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations   we rely on distribution partners to sell our products and disruptions to these channels could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products we believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners we have entered into agreements with several value added resellers some of which also sell products that compete with our products we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain or attract resellers on a timely basis or at all or that the resellers will devote adequate resources to selling our products   our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software or hardware errors our business could be adversely impacted our products are highly technical and are designed to be deployed in very large and complex networks certain of our products can only be fully tested when deployed in networks that generate high amounts of data andor voice traffic as a result we may experience errors in connection with such product and for new products and enhancements any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future could result in loss of or delay in revenue loss of customers increased service and warranty cost all of which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations   if our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could result in substantial product returns which could harm our business our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements if we find errors in the existing software used in our customers’ networks we must modify our software to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks installations could be delayed orders for our products could be cancelled or our products could be returned this would also damage our reputation which could seriously harm our business and prospects   problems arising from use of our products in conjunction with other vendors’ products could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition service providers typically use our products in conjunction with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 27   traditional telecommunications companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse impact on our business traditional telecommunications companies because of their size generally have had greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that impact our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition in addition many of this class of customer have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality andor had products that caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers as a result this class of customer may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products these additional requests and penalties if we are required to agree to them may impact our ability to recognize the revenue from such sales which may negatively impact our business and our financial condition   our success depends on our ability to anticipate market needs and to develop products and product enhancements that will meet those needs and gain market acceptance we cannot ensure that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or that we will be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner if we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products which would significantly harm our business and financial results even if we are able to anticipate and develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance any failure of our future products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect the business and financial results   we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly changing market and if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel our ability to develop market and sell products could be harmed our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering sales marketing and support personnel none of the officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to develop market or sell our products in addition although we completed the acquisition of unisphere on july 1 2002 integration of the products product roadmap and operations is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future as a result of these activities we may lose opportunities and employees which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results   if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays our contract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products for any specific period in any specific quantity or at any specific price except as may be provided in a particular purchase order because we do not have longterm supply contracts with them in addition lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract terms and demand for each component at a given time we provide to our contract manufacturers a 28 demand forecast if we overestimate our requirements the contract manufacturers may assess charges that could negatively impact our gross margins as was the case for the quarter ended september 30 2001 if we underestimate our requirements the contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues   we currently depend on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm supply contracts and changes to those relationships expected or unexpected may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships we depend on third party contract manufacturers each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products we do not have a longterm supply contract with such manufacturers and if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed which could adversely affect our business and financial results in connection with the acquisition of unisphere we added a third contract manufacturer and as part of the integration activities we are consolidating our contract manufacturing at two of the three current contract manufacturers the transition from three to two contract manufacturers may result in disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing operations delays in our ability to ship products to our customers all of which could adversely affect our business and financial results the transition is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2003 however this transition could be delayed be a number of factors including but not limited to systems integration economic conditions and process planning further unisphere received semifinished goods from its contract manufacturer and engaged in final test and assembly of finished product at its facility in westford massachusetts as a result unisphere carried inventory on its books as part of the integration of unisphere we are outsourcing those activities to be consistent with our fulloutsource model if we should fail to effectively manage these activities we could experience disruptions or quality control problems or delays in shipments to our customers all of which could adversely impact our business and financial results   the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our expectation that customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter a customer’s decision to purchase our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process as a result the sales cycle may be lengthy throughout the sales cycle we often spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products even after making the decision to purchase customers tend to deploy the products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customer’s network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we expect to receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis these long cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter   we face risks associated with our restructuring plans that may adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition in response to industry and market conditions we have restructured our business and reduced our workforce the assumptions underlying our restructuring efforts will be assessed on an ongoing basis and may prove to be inaccurate and we may have to restructure our business again in the future to achieve certain cost savings and to strategically realign our resources 29 our restructuring plan is based on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business and the nature severity and duration of the current industry adjustment which may not prove to be accurate while restructuring we have assessed and will continue to assess whether we should further reduce our workforce as well as review the recoverability of our tangible and intangible assets including the land purchased in january 2001 any such decisions may result in the recording of additional charges such as workforce reduction costs facilities reduction costs asset writedowns and contractual settlements additionally estimates and assumptions used in asset valuations are subject to uncertainties as are accounting estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets as a result future market conditions may result in further charges for the write down of tangible and intangible assets we may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in restructuring our business and even if successfully implemented these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions and to achieve future profitability furthermore our workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives lastly costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions andor may not lead to the anticipated cost savings as a result our restructuring efforts may not result in our return to profitability   we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights which could seriously harm the business in recent years there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights although we are not involved in any intellectual property litigation we may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others’ intellectual property claims for alleged infringement and any resulting lawsuit if successful could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights and may require us to stop selling incorporating or using products that use the challenged intellectual property these lawsuits regardless of their success would likely be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention   necessary licenses of thirdparty technology may not be available to us or may be very expensive we integrate thirdparty licensed technology in certain of our products from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements thirdparty licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms our inability to maintain or relicense any third party licenses required in our current products or our inability to obtain thirdparty licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost any of which could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations   our business is subject to risks from global operations we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and also depend on our contract manufacturers’ manufacturing operations which are located within and outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations any or all of these factors could adversely impact our business and financial results 30   we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows the majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us dollars we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen hong kong dollar british pound and the euro related to our sale and service operations outside of the united states an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in us dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income   any acquisition we make could disrupt the business and harm our financial condition we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments in order to enhance our business acquisitions involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of management’s attention from our core business adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire we intend to make investments in complementary companies products or technologies in the event of any such investments or acquisitions we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership incur debt assume liabilities incur amortization expenses related to purchases of intangible assets or incur large and immediate writeoffs   we are a party to lawsuits which if determined adversely to us could result in the imposition of damages against us and could harm our business and financial condition we and certain of our former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits brought by classes of stockholders alleging among other things violations of federal and state securities laws breach of various fiduciary obligations there can be no assurance that actions that have been or will be brought against us will be resolved in our favor any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow   the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors including many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate the factors that may impact the unpredictability of our quarterly results include the reduced visibility into customers’ spending plans the changing market conditions which have resulted in some customer and potential customer bankruptcies a change in the mix of our products sold from higher priced core products to lower priced edge products and long sales and implementation cycle as a result we believe 31 that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not a good indication of future performance it is likely that in some future quarters operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may fall   our stock price has been volatile and could decline substantially the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline among the factors that could affect our stock price are    we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components with the current demand for electronic products component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited we currently purchase several key components including asics from single or limited sources we may not be able to develop an alternate or second source in a timely manner which could hurt our ability to deliver product to customers if we are unable to buy these components on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver product to our customers which would seriously impact present and future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business   if we fail to adequately evolve our systems and processes in a changing business environment our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures if we fail to continue to evolve our systems and processes our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted   our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems changes in industry structure could lead to product discontinuances a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of the internet and on the deployment of our product by customers that depend on the continued growth of the internet as a result of the economic slowdown and the reduction in capital spending which have particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on internet infrastructure has declined which has had a material adverse effect on our business to the extent that the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business operating results and financial condition 32   we face risks from the uncertainties of regulation of the telecommunications industry as well as the internet and commerce over the internet the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry also there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on the internet we could be adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using internet protocol encryption technology and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition

overview

    we are a leading provider of internet infrastructure solutions that enable
internet service providers and other telecommunications service providers to
meet the demands resulting from the rapid growth of the internet our internet
routers are designed and purposebuilt for service provider networks and offer
our customers trusted performance reliability scalability interoperability
and flexibility as well as reduced complexity and cost compared to legacy
alternatives unlike conventional routers originally developed for enterprise
applications and increasingly inadequate for use in the new public network our
products are specifically designed to accommodate the size and scope of the
internet our products combine high performance asicbased packet forwarding
technology the features of our junos internet software and an
internetoptimized architecture into a purposebuilt solution for the service
provider market

industry background

    the internet has evolved from an academic research project into a network of
hundreds of separately administered public and private networks interconnected
using internet protocol ip ip traffic is growing exponentially driven by
increasing numbers of new users connected devices and internet transactions
the result of the widespread use of ip is a ubiquitous network that today
carries a large and growing amount of data traffic enabling millions of users to
share information and conduct electronic commerce industry research firms
forecast continued dramatic growth worldwide in the internet and internet
traffic the importance of ip continues to increase as the number of users
connected devices and transactions over the internet grows

    the rapid adoption of the internet and the tremendous growth of ip traffic
have prompted service providers to construct large scale data networks these
networks are being optimized to transport data traffic as compared to
traditional telephone networks which were optimized to transport voice traffic
the architecture of these next generation networks is being driven by two key
technologies packetcell switching and optical networking

    advantages of packetcell switching packetcell switching technology which
divides data traffic into distinct units called packets or cells and routes each
packet or cell independently provides superior use of available network
capacity compared to traditional circuit switching technology in a circuit
switched network each data stream such as a voice telephone call between two
points is provided with a dedicated channel or circuit for the duration of
the telephone call this approach leads to inefficient use of network resources
because a channel is fully dedicated to each transaction whether or not data is
actually flowing at any given moment as a result a circuit switched
architecture is highly inefficient for internet applications which tend to
create large bursts of data traffic followed by long periods of silence
packetcell switching architectures enable greater utilization out of a fixed
capacity circuit by combining traffic that has different capacity demands of the
circuit at different times packetcell switches more efficiently fill the
available network bandwidth with packets of data from many users thereby
reducing the wasted bandwidth due to silence from any one particular user the
use of packetcell switching is driving the architecture of the internet to be
fundamentally different from traditional circuit switched voice based networks
in packetcell switched networks ip has emerged as the de facto standard for
providing services to end users primary packetcell switching products include
frame relay switches atm switches and routers

    rapid advances in optical networking optical networking technology uses
pulses of light rather than pulses of electricity to transmit data in a
network and uses fiber optic connections instead of wires optical networking
can be used to transmit much more information over a given connection than
electrical signals can convey optical networking advances such as dense
wavelength division multiplexing or dwdm which allows transmission of several
frequencies of light over one strand of optical fiber have enabled still higher
data transmission rates and improved efficiency of bandwidth utilization

    packetcell technologies have not kept up with optical technologies many
service providers are installing dwdm equipment and are increasingly focusing on
combining ip and optical networking technologies however traditional packet
switching equipment is not capable of forwarding packets at rates sufficient to
keep pace with optical transmission


                                       3

speeds as affordable fiber optic transmission capacity becomes widely
available the performance and complexity of current packetcell switching
architectures is increasingly constraining the growth of the internet

fundamental requirements for the internet

    the reliability and performance of current internet infrastructure equipment
have become and continue to be critical issues for service providers as they
support dramatic growth in ip traffic and increasingly seek to offer new revenue
generating missioncritical and other services the need for high reliability
high performance high performance under stressful conditions scalability
interoperability and cost effectiveness are fundamental requirements in meeting
the needs associated with the growth in ip traffic new requirements will
continue to arise for next generation networks which will drive a set of new
requirements for internet infrastructure equipment

    high reliability as businesses and consumers increasingly rely on the
internet for missioncritical applications high network reliability becomes
essential service providers are increasingly expected to provide a similar
degree of reliability on the internet that users have become accustomed to on
the traditional telephone network the five nines 99999 reliability
standard of the traditional telephone network is becoming the target to which
suppliers of nextgeneration internet platforms are being compared as service
providers begin to bundle voice and data on their networks this high degree of
reliability is becoming even more critical

    high performance to handle the rapid growth in ip traffic todays networks
increasingly require routers that can operate at higher speeds the processing
of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated forwarding
technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination based on
priority data type and other considerations since a large number of ip
packets many of which perform critical administrative functions are small in
size high performance internet routers need to achieve their specified
transmission speeds even for small packet sizes since smaller packets increase
packet processing demands routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be
more resource intensive than routing of larger packets a wire speed router
which achieves its specified transmission rate for any type of traffic passing
through it can accomplish this task thus provisioning of missioncritical
services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed
processing

    high performance under stressful conditions in a large and complex network
individual components inevitably fail however the failure of an individual
device or link must not compromise the network as a whole in a typical network
when a failure occurs the network loses some degree of capacity and in turn a
greater load falls on the remaining network routers which must provide
alternate routes routers must quickly adjust to the new state of the network to
maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping significant numbers of
packets when active routes are lost or when large numbers of routes change
routing protocols are used to accomplish this convergence a process that places
even greater stress on the router given the complexity of internet
infrastructure particularly compared to enterprise networks the convergence
process is far more complex and places a far greater load on the routing
software thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device

    scalability due to the rapid growth in internet users and ip traffic
service providers must continuously expand their networks both in terms of
increased numbers of access points of presence pops and also greater capacity
per pop to facilitate this expansion process internet infrastructure equipment
must be highly scalable next generation routers therefore need to be
upgradeable and configurable to function within constantly changing networks
while incurring minimal downtime

    interoperability service providers do not have the time or inclination to
change their existing networks to favor introduction of new products rather
new products must be compatible with the existing environment given the open
and interconnected nature of the internet the complexity of running an
internet backbone network requires a service provider to control and police
relations with other service providers for example service providers must
carefully control what traffic is accepted under what conditions from other
providers the software in each router must offer 100 compatibility with the
interior protocols and standards used within each service providers backbone
network the compatibility level must be maintained despite changes to software
equipment configuration and network architecture and upgrades to the various
protocol standards thus routing software must be flexible and quickly
upgradeable to support any necessary revisions this level of compatibility in
turn cannot impact the performance scalability or reliability of the
equipment attaining this sophisticated level of interoperability is highly
challenging and requires significant testing to ensure compatibility


                                       4

    cost effectiveness exponential growth in ip traffic and intense price
competition in the telecommunications market is increasingly requiring service
providers to seek solutions that significantly reduce the capital expenditures
required to build and operate their networks in addition to the basic cost of
equipment such as routers service providers incur substantial ancillary costs
in terms of space required to deploy the equipment power consumption and
ongoing operations and maintenance service providers therefore want to deploy
dense and varied equipment configurations in limited amounts of rack and floor
space therefore in order to continue to scale their networks toward higher
data speeds in a cost effective manner service providers need the ability to
mix and match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities
without significantly increasing the consumption of space or power

    there is a clear need for next generation routers that can support high
speeds and offer new ipbased services network operators are eagerly seeking
new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within
their networks and reduce the cost of their architectures

the juniper networks solution

    we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available
purposebuilt internet backbone router optimized for the specific high
performance needs of service providers as the need for core bandwidth continued
to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was
created our products are designed to address the needs at the core and at the
edge of the network by combining the features of highperformance asicbased
packet forwarding technology our junos internet software and an
internetoptimized architecture

    our product platforms share common software and services and common asic
technology for full compatibility and scalability critical service provider
applications including highspeed access peering and hosting are served by our
platforms physical interfaces are interchangeable between platforms increasing
user flexibility and allowing common sparing our solution provides several key
benefits to our customers carrier class reliability wire speed performance
scalability interoperability flexibility reduced complexity and cost
effectiveness

    junos internet software our internet software called junos is designed to
meet the ip network routing operations and control requirements of the worlds
largest service providers and is an integral embedded component of our product
family system architecture the ability of junos to manage the complex network
sharing relationships among service providers allows our products to be placed
at critical points in the core of a service providers network the junos
internet software allows our products to have widespread network placement due
to its interoperability with ciscos internetwork operating system or ios
currently the most broadly deployed routing operating system

    unconstrained by legacy routing software we developed junos using a modular
design in which distinct functions are implemented as separate modules with
well defined interfaces and interactions simplifying troubleshooting and
maintenance junos operates in protected memory mode these features keep
functionality distinct and minimize the impact of any failure that may occur to
the specific software application in which the failure occurs also we believe
junos software modularity will enable the continuous upgrade of new enhanced
capabilities while protecting reliability and compatibility with existing
networks

    high performance asicbased packet forwarding technology our products
utilize high performance asicbased technology the result is a platform that is
substantially faster than todays general purpose microprocessor based routers
in its ability to process and forward ip packets allowing our products to
deliver high performance at wire speed the ability to enhance and implement
large scale asics will be a longterm differentiator for us particularly as the
sophistication required to forward traffic across higher speed networks
increases we expect to continue to leverage our existing asic technology in
future products and continue to capitalize on our advanced asic design
capabilities

    internet optimized architecture as purposebuilt internet backbone routers
our products employ an architecture designed exclusively for the internet the
system architecture provides a clean separation between the routing and
packetforwarding functions separating these two functions enables us to
develop independently a fullfeatured routing protocol and traffic engineering
functionality through our junos internet software and wire speed packet
forwarding performance through high performance asics furthermore with the
routing and forwarding functions segregated the products do not sacrifice
performance even when there is a failure in the network when a failure occurs
junos detects

the failure and is able to quickly converge to the new state of the network
while the asics continue to forward packets at wire speed until they receive
updated routes from junos

the juniper networks strategy

    our objective is to become the primary supplier of high performance internet
backbone infrastructure the key elements of our strategy are described below

    maintain and extend technology leadership our asic technology junos
internet software and internetoptimized architecture have been key elements to
establishing our technology leadership we believe that these elements are
highly leverageable into future products we are currently developing we intend
to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the internet
infrastructure market through continued significant investment to enhance the
feature richness of our products and to develop future differentiated offerings
for service providers

    leverage early lead as supplier of purposebuilt internet infrastructure
from inception we have focused solely on designing and building internet
infrastructure for service providers we have integrated purposebuilt software
and hardware into an internet optimized architecture that specifically meets
service providers needs and have seen significantly positive initial responses
from our existing and potential customers we believe that many of these
customers will deploy internet backbone infrastructure equipment from only a few
vendors the purposebuilt advantages of our products provide us with a
timetomarket lead which is a critical advantage in gaining rapid penetration
as one of these selected vendors once our products are widely deployed in a
service providers network as the primary or even secondary internet backbone
infrastructure equipment we believe we create a significant barrier to entry to
potential competitors who do not currently offer commerciallyviable next
generation routing solutions

    work very closely with key customers in developing our products including
our junos internet software we worked very closely with customers to design and
build a product specifically to meet their complex needs since junos has been
available and used by our customers for over three years we understand clearly
the challenges facing these carriers enabling us to subsequently design
additional features and capabilities into both our software and hardware we
believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers
have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date we plan
to continue to work very closely with our key customers to implement
enhancements to current products as well as to design future products that
specifically meet their evolving needs we are also actively involved with these
customers in developing key standards such as mpls and are an active
participant in standards organizations such as the internet engineering task
force and the optical internetworking forum

    increase penetration at major service providers our initial focus has been
to penetrate several of the largest service providers where operators have the
technical sophistication resources and desire to test and evaluate our solution
against potential alternatives we believe that there is a significant
opportunity to further penetrate these large and complex networks given the
advantages of our products as the growth of the internet requires these major
service providers to continue to build their networks and replace outdated
equipment we will pursue further opportunities to capture greater market share
within these large accounts

    leverage early successes to penetrate new customers rapidly we believe that
the internet infrastructure equipment buying patterns of the medium and
smallersized service providers typically lag behind those of the larger service
providers since the network challenges that the large service providers face
today are likely to be the problems encountered by smaller service providers in
the near future we believe smaller service providers are likely to deploy
equipment similar to larger service providers furthermore smaller service
providers often lack the technical resources to thoroughly test different
vendors products therefore they typically piggyback on larger service
providers evaluation efforts by purchasing the same platforms deployed by the
larger service providers since we have begun to sell to several of the largest
service providers we intend to leverage this success by allocating our
marketing efforts towards a greater number of medium and smallersized service
providers

    enable new ipbased services our platform enables service providers to
build networks cost effectively and to offer new differentiated services for
their customers more efficiently than conventional products while we believe
that current service providers are likely to be the largest and most successful
ip network operators in the near term many new service providers are likely to
emerge oriented around the delivery of ipbased services these services which
include web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services vpns outsourced
enterprise applications and voiceover ip are cost

effectively enabled by our internet infrastructure platform although the market
for our products today is driven primarily by the need for traditional internet
network capacity as other ipbased services and applications continue to grow
in importance the total potential market for our products will continue to grow
commensurately

technology

    our core technology consists of our internet backbone router architecture
junos internet software and asic hardware expertise our generalpurpose
architecture was initially embodied in the m40 but also is designed to serve as
the platform for our future generations of products to date we have developed
manufactured and shipped five products based on our mseries internet routers 
the m5 m10 m20 m40 and m160

product architecture

    the architecture of our products is exemplified by the m40 the m40
architecture delivers the forwarding rates and network control necessary to
scale internet backbones rapidly and reliably the m40 system includes a routing
engine or re and a packet forwarding engine or pfe the clean separation of
the routing and forwarding functions ensures that the two functions do not
compete for the same resources

    the routing engine the re consists of the junos internet software operating
on an intelbased platform the junos internet software features internetscale
protocol support with flexible policy software that enables maximum control
over the acceptance modification and advertisement of route prefixes in
addition the junos internet software offers a range of configuration management
tools that simplify the configuration process and help protect against operator
error the re conducts the processing intensive activity of maintaining the
routing table from which the forwarding table residing in the pfe is derived
the re is connected to the pfe through a dedicated 100 mbps link after
constructing or updating the forwarding table the re downloads a copy of the
table to the pfe updates to the forwarding table are done atomically in small
incremental steps so that packet forwarding is not interrupted by routing
changes

    the packet forwarding engine the m40 delivers wire speed packet forwarding
using our asic designs all links between asics are oversized dedicated
channels and the pfe architecture is free from the bottlenecks faced by
traditional crossbar switches which use intelligent agent software to perform
both routing and forwarding functions over multiple connections to either parts
of the network bottlenecks can occur in a crossbar switch because the routing
and forwarding functions are not separated the heart of the pfe is the internet
processor asic

    all lookup rates reflect longestmatch route table lookups for all packets
and all lookups are performed in hardware there is no caching mechanism which
is a mechanism by which critical information such as destinations for traffic
is stored in rapidly accessible memory to make the process of looking up traffic
destinations faster in addition there is no risk of cache misses in the system
which can result in slower storage access and thus considerably slower traffic
delivery in addition the forwarding table can be updated without affecting
forwarding rates the internet processor is programmable to support up to four
different forwarding tables layer 2 andor layer 3 simultaneously supported
forwarding protocols currently include unicast and multicast ipv4 and mpls
finally the internet processor maintains its performance regardless of length
of lookups or table size

    the pfe also features a shared memory system with singlestage buffering so
packets are written to and read from memory only once singlestage buffering
greatly reduces the complexities and throughput delays associated with
multistage buffering systems the pooled memory is distributed across the
flexible pic concentrator or fpc cards allowing memory to scale as interfaces
are added the internet processor also features prefix accounting mechanisms
that operate at rates in excess of 20 mpps

junos internet software traffic engineering and control

    junos internet software offers a full suite of internetscale
internettested routing protocols protocols and software tools which are used
to control and direct network traffic are critical to an internet backbone
routing solution software control is made more important by the fact that the
size and complexity of backbone networks are increasing at a time when service
providers are looking to differentiate themselves through valueadded service
offerings


                                       7

    junos internet software features implementations of all major internet
protocols including bgp4 dvmrp pim isis open shortest path first isis
and open shortest path first are algorithms broadly used in enterprise networks
and by service providers to determine and update the running state of the
network and available destinations in the network these implementations were
developed inhouse by our design team which has extensive experience in
addressing the scaling issues of rapidly growing service providers

    junos internet software also provides a new level of traffic engineering
capabilities with its implementation of mpls developed in conjunction with the
internet engineering task force our mpls capability offers enhanced visibility
into traffic patterns and the ability to control the path traffic takes through
the network path selection enables service providers to engineer traffic for
efficient use of network capacity and avoidance of congestion we expect mpls
and its traffic engineering capabilities to become a crucial tool for service
providers as they scale their networks

    junos internet software features a modular design with separate programs
running in protected memory space in conjunction with an independent operating
system unlike monolithic unprotected operating system designs which are prone
to system wide failure the protected modular approach improves reliability by
ensuring that modifications made to one module have no unwanted sideeffects on
other sections of the software in addition having clean software interfaces
between modules facilitates software development and maintenance enabling
faster response to customer needs and delivery of new features

    junos internet software has been extensively tested in multiple service
provider networks to ensure compatibility with ciscos ios since each major
service providers network is different this extensive testing is necessary to
ensure seamless introduction into existing service provider environments

customers

    our customers include end users value added resellers and an original
equipment manufacturer we recognize revenue from the shipment of products at
the time of shipment unless we have future obligations for network
interoperability or if we have to obtain customer acceptance in those cases we
defer recognition of the revenue and related costs until we have met our
obligations

    worldcom ericsson and qwest accounted for approximately 14 13 and 11
respectively of our recognized revenues for the year ended december 31 2001

sales and marketing

    we sell and market our products primarily through our direct sales
organization valueadded resellers and an original equipment manufacturer

    direct sales our north american direct sales organization is divided into
regional operations with our direct sales efforts focused on the largest service
providers the direct sales account managers cover the market on an assigned
account basis and work as a team with account oriented systems engineers they
are directed by a regional operations manager who reports to the north american
vice president of sales we also have technical engineers that consult with and
provide our customers with guidance and assistance on the evolution of their
networks as it relates to the deployment of our products these consulting
engineers also help in defining the features that are required for our products
to be successful in specific applications a key feature of our sales effort is
the relationship we establish at various levels in our customers organization
our sales team maintains contact with key individuals who have service planning
and infrastructure buildout responsibility

    value added resellers we have complemented our direct sales effort in the
united states through the addition of several highly focused value added
resellers our arrangements with value added resellers typically have been
nonexclusive and provide the value added reseller with discounts based upon the
volume of their orders

    original equipment manufacturer partner we have established a strategic
distribution relationship with ericsson we believe that ericsson has
significant customer relationships in place and offers products which complement
ours our agreement with ericsson allows it to distribute our products on a
worldwide nonexclusive basis with discounts based upon the volume of orders it
receives ericsson provides the first level of support to its customers


                                       8

    international resellers we have established in addition to ericsson
strategic value added reseller relationships with nortel and alcatel to sell and
service our products on a worldwide nonexclusive basis to further our
international sales objectives we also have established a number of country
specific value added resellers these resellers have expertise in deploying
complex internet infrastructure equipment in their respective markets and
provide the first level of support required by our international customers

    as of december 31 2001 we employed 360 people in our sales and marketing
organizations

customer service and support

    we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the
successful installation and ongoing support of our products and we have hired
support engineers with proven internet experience to provide those services we
offer the following services 24 hours a day seven days a week technical
assistance online telephone and onsite professional services educational
services logistics services and webbased information

    we offer a variety of flexible and comprehensive support programs including
basic hardware and software warranty services next day onsite parts and labor
24 hours a day seven days a week same day parts and labor and onsite resident
engineers we deliver these services directly to major end users and also
utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our
partners and third party organizations we also train our partners in the
delivery of education and support services

    customer service and support provide front line product support and is the
problem resolution interface to our partners and direct end users if customer
service and support are unable to resolve an issue themselves they duplicate
the problem scenario and provide the failure information such as logs dumps
traces and system configuration to appropriate subject matter experts in our
engineering department

    based on the severity of the problem and the impact to our customers
network there are strict escalation guidelines to ensure that the appropriate
technical resources and management attention is brought to bear on the problem
in a timeframe commensurate with problem priority the overall goal is to fix
the problem at the appropriate level in the right timeframe in order to ensure
our customers satisfaction

    as of december 31 2001 we employed 143 people in our customer service and
support organization with the majority located in our sunnyvale california
corporate headquarters

research and development

    we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in
the fields of high end computing network system design internet routing
protocols and embedded software these individuals have been drawn from leading
computer data networking and telecommunications companies in addition to
building complex hardware and software systems the engineering team has
experience in delivering very large highly integrated asics and extremely
scalable internet software

    our research and development department is organized into teams that work in
parallel on several projects in a manner similar to the development of
successive generations of complex microprocessors as a result we will seek to
offer our customers next generation products as they are needed

    we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our
strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional applications
incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness of our product
and service offerings we are leveraging our first generation asics developing
additional network interfaces targeted to our customer applications and
continuing to develop next generation technology to support the anticipated
growth in network bandwidth requirements we continue to expand the
functionality of our junos internet software to improve performance and
scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface

    our research and development process is driven by the availability of new
technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested significant
time and resources in creating a structured process for undertaking all product


                                       9

development projects this process involves all functional groups and all levels
within our company following an assessment of market demand our research and
development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product
specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales
organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and
addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts
and development projects to market

    as of december 31 2001 we employed 474 people in our research and
development organization

    our research and development expenses totaled 1555 million for the year
ended december 31 2001 878 million for the year ended december 31 2000 and
415 million for the year ended december 31 1999

manufacturing

    our manufacturing operation is entirely outsourced we have developed
manufacturing relationships with solectron and celestica under which we have
subcontracted our manufacturing activity this subcontracting activity extends
from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material
procurement final assembly test control and shipment to our customers we
design specify and monitor all of the tests that are required to meet internal
and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following
benefits

       we operate without dedicating any space to manufacturing operations

       we conserve the working capital that would be required for funding
        inventory

       we can adjust manufacturing volumes quickly to meet changes in demand
        and

       we can quickly deliver products to customers with turnkey manufacturing
        and drop shipment capabilities

    our asics are manufactured by ibm who is responsible for all aspects of the
production of the asics using our proprietary designs

competition

    competition in the internet infrastructure market is intense the market
historically has been dominated by cisco systems inc with other companies
such as nortel networks and lucent technologies inc providing products to a
smaller segment of the market in addition a number of public and private
companies have announced plans for new products to address the same problems
which our products address

    cisco traditionally has been the dominant supplier of solutions to this
market we believe this is the result of its early leadership position in the
enterprise router market as the internet has grown rapidly cisco has leveraged
this position and has developed a broad product line of routers which support
all major local area and wide area interfaces we believe that our ability to
compete with cisco depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are
superior in meeting the needs of service providers and are extremely compatible
with ciscos current and future products although we believe that we are
currently among the top providers of internet infrastructure solutions
worldwide we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully
with cisco currently the leading provider in this market

    we expect that over time large companies with significant resources
technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product
lines such as lucent and nortel will introduce new products which are designed
to compete more effectively in this market as a result we expect to face
increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly
more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the
purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to
compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be
successful

    many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco lucent and
nortel have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their
products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage
customers from purchasing our products also many of our current and potential
competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that
could be leveraged increased competition could result in price


                                       10

reduction fewer customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market
share any of which could seriously harm our operating results

    there are also many small public and private companies which claim to have
products with greater capabilities than our products consolidation in this
industry has begun with one or more of these smaller private companies being
acquired by large established suppliers of internet infrastructure products
and we believe it is likely to continue as a result we expect to face
increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly
more resources than we have

    several companies also provide solutions which can substitute for some uses
of routers for example high bandwidth asynchronous transfer mode atm
switches are used in the core of certain major backbone service providers atm
switches can carry a variety of traffic types including voice video and data
using fixed 53 byte cells companies that use atm switches are enhancing their
products with new software technologies such as multiprotocol label switching
or mpls which can potentially simplify the task of mixing routers and switches
in the same network these substitutes can reduce the need for large numbers of
routers

intellectual property

    our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our
internally developed technology and knowhow our engineering teams have
significant expertise in asic design and we own all rights to the design of the
asics which form the core of our products our junos internet software was
developed internally and is protected by united states and other copyright laws

    while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to
protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological
and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product
enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and
maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that
others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our
technology

    our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual
property rights and protect our intellectual property rights while we have
filed patent applications we cannot be certain that these applications will
issue into patents that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual
property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property
rights

employees

    as of december 31 2001 we had 1227 fulltime employees 474 of whom were
engaged in research and development 360 in sales and marketing 143 in customer
support and 250 in finance administration it and operations none of our
employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced any work
stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

    our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued
service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of
whom is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined
period of time the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees
could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and
results of operations our future success also depends on our continuing ability
to attract train and retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial
personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no
assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future

                                  risk factors

we face intense competition that could reduce our market share or slow the rate
of increase in market share

    competition in the internet infrastructure market is intense this market
has historically been dominated by cisco with other companies such as nortel
networks and lucent technologies providing products to a smaller segment of the
market in addition a number of other small public and private companies have
announced plans for new products to address the same problems which our products
address if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and


                                       11
page

future competitors from a product offering standpoint or from potential price
competition including arising from excess inventory of products held by our
competitors or by third parties we could be required to reduce prices
resulting in reduced gross margins and loss of market share each of which could
materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial
condition

our success depends on our ability to develop products and product enhancements
that will achieve market acceptance

    we cannot ensure that we will be able to develop new products or product
enhancements in a timely manner or at all any failure to develop new products
or product enhancements could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales
of our present and future products which would significantly harm the business
and financial results even if we are able to develop and commercially introduce
new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or
enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance any failure of our
future products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect the business
and financial results

a decrease in our revenues or a failure to increase our revenues would affect
our profitability

    although our net revenues have grown from 1026 million for the year ended
december 31 1999 to 8870 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the
economic slowdown in general and in the telecommunications industry
specifically makes increasing our revenues difficult and uncertain and a
greater likelihood of decreasing revenues we have large fixed expenses and
expect to continue to incur significant and increasing engineering and product
development expenses and as net revenues could either decrease or fail to
increase there can be no assurances that we will maintain profitability

the financial condition of some of our customers limits our visibility making
forecasting difficult

    we have experienced and expect in the foreseeable future to continue to
experience limited visibility as to our customers spending plans and capital
budgets this limited visibility complicates the forecasting process
additionally many customers funded their network infrastructure purchases
through a variety of debt and similar instruments and now many of these same
customers face significant debt loads which reduce their ability to make future
purchases and in some cases to pay for the purchases made to date this has
contributed and we expect it to continue to contribute to the uncertainty of
the amounts and timing of capital expenditures further limiting visibility and
complicating the forecasting process in some cases these customers have filed
for bankruptcy as a result of their debt burdens although the expectation of
these customers is that they will emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings in the
future a bankruptcy proceeding can be a slow and cumbersome process further
limiting the visibility and complicating the forecasting process as to these
customers

economic conditions combined with our limited operating history makes
forecasting difficult

    the current economic conditions generally and in the telecommunication
industry specifically combined with our own limited operating history makes it
difficult to accurately forecast revenues and there is limited meaningful
historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses in
addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends
and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the
shortterm if we do not achieve our expected revenues our operating results
will be below our expectations and those of investors and market analysts which
could cause the price of our common stock to decline

    in addition timing of deployment of our products can vary widely and
depends on various factors customers with large networks particularly ptts
usually expand their networks slowly on a periodic basis we cannot predict
these sales and development cycles these long cycles as well as our
expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with
short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary
significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur
additional costs or experience manufacturing delays


                                       12
page
    we provide forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturers prior to
scheduled delivery of products to our customers if we overestimate our
requirements the contract manufacturer may assess carrying charges on the
excess material and those charges could negatively impact our gross margins if
we underestimate our requirements the contract manufacturer may have an
inadequate inventory which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and
result in delays in shipments and revenues in addition lead times for
materials and components we order vary significantly and depend on factors such
as the specific supplier contract terms and demand for each component at a
given time we also may experience shortages of certain components from time to
time which also could delay the manufacturing of our products

although our customer base has increased substantially there is still a limited
number of customers which comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any
decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect

    we expect that a large portion of our net revenues will continue to depend
on sales to a limited number of customers any downturn in the business of these
customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such
customers which could adversely affect our net revenues and results of
operations

if we fail to manage expansion effectively we could seriously harm our business
financial condition and prospects

    our ability to successfully implement our business plan develop and offer
our products and manage expansion under rapidly changing market conditions
requires a comprehensive and effective planning and management process we
continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and
internationally and have grown headcount substantially the growth in business
headcount and relationships with customers and other third parties has placed
and will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and
resources we will need to continue to improve our operational managerial and
financial controls reporting systems and procedures and will need to continue
to expand train and manage our work force worldwide

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our
expectation that customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead
times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from
quarter to quarter

    a customers decision to purchase our products involves a significant
commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification
process as a result our sales cycle may be lengthy throughout the sales
cycle we often spend considerable time educating and providing information to
prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of the products even after
making the decision to purchase our customers tend to deploy the products
slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the
skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of
the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and software
configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks
usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis
accordingly we expect to receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts
on an irregular basis because of our limited operating history we cannot
predict these sales and development cycles these long cycles as well as our
expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with
short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary
significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key
components

    electronic component shortages are always possible and the predictability of
the availability of such components is limited we currently purchase several
key components including asics from a single source we may not be able to
develop an alternate or second source in a timely manner which could hurt our
ability to deliver product to customers if we are unable to buy these
components on a timely basis we may not be able to deliver product to our
customers which would seriously impact present and future sales which would in
turn adversely affect our business

we currently depend on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm
supply contracts and if we unexpectedly have to qualify a new contract
manufacturer we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships


                                       13
page

    we depend on third party contract manufacturers each of whom is a third
party manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products we do
not have a longterm supply contract with these manufacturers and if we should
fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or
more of them should experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems
in our manufacturing operations our ability to ship products to our customers
could be delayed which could adversely affect our business and financial
results

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly
changing market and if we are unable to hire additional personnel our ability
to sell products could be harmed

    our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive
officers and other key engineering sales marketing and support personnel none
of the officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any
specific term

    we also will need to continue to hire engineering and other personnel in the
future and we believe our success depends in large part upon our ability to
attract and retain these key employees competition for these persons is
intense especially in the san francisco bay area the loss of the services of
any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel
in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers
could delay the development and introduction of our products

    in addition we believe that our future success is dependent upon
establishing successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners
we have entered into agreements with several value added resellers some of whom
also sell products that compete with our products we cannot be certain that we
will be able to reach agreement with additional resellers on a timely basis or
at all or that they will devote adequate resources to selling our products

the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading
price of our common stock

    our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to
quarter due to a number of factors including many which are outside of our
control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate

    the factors that may impact the unpredictability of our quarterly results
include the long sales and implementation cycle and the reduced visibility into
customers spending plans and associated revenues as a result we believe that
quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are not a good indication of
future performance it is likely that in some future quarters operating results
may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in which
case the price of our common stock may fall our operating expenses are largely
based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are
and will continue to be fixed in the short term as a result a delay in
generating or recognizing revenue for the reasons set forth above or for any
other reason could cause significant variations in our operating results from
quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses

if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks installations
will be delayed or cancelled and could result in substantial product returns
which could harm our business

    our products are designed to interface with our customers existing
networks each of which has different specifications and utilizes multiple
protocol standards many of our customers networks contain multiple generations
of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and
evolved our products must interoperate with all of the products within these
networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers
requirements if we find errors in the existing software used in our customers
networks we must modify our junos internet software to fix or overcome these
errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing
software and hardware if our products do not interoperate with those of our
customers networks installations could be delayed orders for our products
could be cancelled or our products could be returned this would also seriously
harm our reputation which could seriously harm our business and prospects
because our products are complex and are deployed in complex environments they
may have errors or defects that we find only after full deployment which could
seriously harm our business


                                       14
page

    our products are highly complex and designed to be deployed in very large
and complex networks although we have thoroughly tested our products because
of the nature of the product it can only be fully tested when deployed in very
large networks with high amounts of traffic to date our products have been
deployed only on a limited basis consequently our customers may discover
errors or defects in the hardware or the software after it has been fully
deployed if we are unable to fix errors or other problems that may be
identified in full deployment we could experience among other things loss of
or delay in revenues and loss of market share loss of customers diversion of
development resources and increased service and warranty costs

customer product liability claims based on errors in our software or mistakes in
performing our services could result in costly litigation against us

    we may be subject to claims based on errors in our software or mistakes in
performing our services including claims relating to damages to our customers
internal systems our contracts with our customers generally contain provisions
designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims such as
disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special
consequential and incidental damages we believe our product liability insurance
is adequate to cover potential product liability claims however a product
liability claim whether successful or not could seriously impact our capital
reserves harm our reputation and direct the attention of key personnel away
from our business any of which could harm our business

problems arising from use of our products in conjunction with other vendors
products could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition

    service providers typically use our products in conjunction with products
from other vendors as a result when problems occur it may be difficult to
identify the source of the problem these problems may cause us to incur
significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering
personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer
relations problems

our products are new and face rapid technological changes and evolving standards
and if we do not respond in a timely manner our business could be harmed

    the internet infrastructure market is characterized by rapid technological
change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and
evolving industry standards in developing our products we have made and will
continue to make assumptions with respect to which standards will be adopted by
our customers and competitors if the standards adopted are different from those
which we have chosen to support market acceptance of our products may be
significantly reduced or delayed and our business will be seriously harmed in
addition the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the
emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete

    in addition in order to introduce products embodying new technologies and
new industry standards we must be able to gain access to the latest
technologies of our suppliers such as ibm any failure to gain access to the
latest technologies could harm our business and operating results

our failure to establish and maintain key customer relationships may result in
delays in introducing new products or cause customers to forego purchasing our
products

    our future success will also depend upon our ability to develop and manage
key customer relationships in order to introduce a variety of new products and
product enhancements that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our
customers our failure to establish and maintain these customer relationships
may adversely affect our ability to develop new products and product
enhancements in addition we may experience delays in releasing new products
and product enhancements in the future material delays in introducing new
products and enhancements or our inability to introduce competitive new products
may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase those of
our competitors which could seriously harm our business

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our
intellectual property rights from thirdparty challenges


                                       15

    we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret
laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees
consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of
our software documentation and other proprietary information despite our
efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to
copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring
unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the
steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology
particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary
rights as fully as in the united states

necessary licenses of thirdparty technology may not be available to us or may
be very expensive

    from time to time we may be required to license technology from third
parties to develop new products or product enhancements we cannot assure you
that third party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable
terms if at all the inability to obtain any thirdparty license required to
develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain
substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater
cost either of which could seriously harm our business financial condition and
results of operations

we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights
which could seriously harm our business

    in recent years there has been significant litigation in the united states
involving patents and other intellectual property rights although we are not
involved in any intellectual property litigation we may be a party to
litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of
an alleged infringement of others intellectual property claims for alleged
infringement and any resulting lawsuit if successful could subject us to
significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights
these lawsuits regardless of their success would likely be timeconsuming and
expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention any
potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more
of the following

       stop selling incorporating or using our products that use the
        challenged intellectual property

       obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a
        license to sell or use the relevant technology which license may not be
        available on reasonable terms or at all or

       redesign those products that use such technology

if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions our business may be
seriously harmed although we carry general liability insurance our insurance
may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify
us for all liability that may be imposed

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could incur substantial costs in
defending ourselves

    companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors
frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices
we have received claims of this kind in the past and we cannot assure you that
we will not receive claims of this kind in the future as we seek to hire
qualified personnel or that those claims will not result in material litigation
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims
regardless of their merits

any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial
condition

    we intend to make investments in complementary companies products or
technologies in the event of any such investments or acquisitions we could
issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership
incur debt assume liabilities incur amortization expenses related to goodwill
and other intangible assets or incur large and immediate writeoffs

    these acquisitions also involve numerous risks including problems combining
the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs
diversion of managements attention from our core business adverse effects on
existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated
with entering markets in which we have no or


                                       16
page

limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees particularly
those of the acquired organizations we cannot assure you that we will be able
to successfully integrate any businesses products technologies or personnel
that we might acquire in the future

we face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our
financial condition and results of operations

    we market sell and service our products in the united states and
internationally we have established offices throughout europe and in the asia
pacific region we will continue to expand our international operations and
enter new international markets this expansion will require significant
management attention and financial resources to develop successfully direct and
indirect international sales and support channels we may not be able to
maintain or increase international market demand for our products

    international operations are subject to inherent risks including greater
difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods
difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations the impact
of recessions in economies outside the united states unexpected changes in
regulatory requirements certification requirements reduced protection for
intellectual property rights in some countries potentially adverse tax
consequences and political and economic instability

    our international revenues were 2794 million for the year ended december
31 2001 and are denominated in us dollars consequently we do not currently
engage in currency hedging activities however a portion of our international
revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future

risks related to the 475 subordinated convertible notes due march 15 2007

    in march 2000 we completed an offering the debt offering of 11 billion
in 475 subordinated convertible notes due march 15 2007 the convertible
notes in connection with the convertible notes we are subject to certain
risks in addition to those described above those additional risks include the
following

substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash
flow

    as a result of the debt offering we have a substantial amount of outstanding
indebtedness as a result of this indebtedness our principal and interest
payment obligations have increased substantially there is the possibility that
we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of interest
on and other amounts due with respect to the convertible notes when due we may
also add additional equipment loans and lease lines to finance capital
expenditures and may obtain additional longterm debt working capital lines of
credit and lease lines

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences
including

       increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
        conditions

       limiting our ability to obtain additional financing

       requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash
        flow from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the
        amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes including
        capital expenditures

       limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our
        business and the industry in which we compete and

       placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less
        leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital
        resources

item 1 business

overview

        we are a leading provider of purposebuilt internet infrastructure
solutions that meet the scalability performance density and compatibility
requirements of rapidly evolving opticallyenabled internet protocol ip
networks unlike conventional routers originally developed for enterprise
applications and increasingly inadequate for service provider use in public
networks our products are specifically designed or purposebuilt for service
provider networks and to accommodate the size and scope of the internet our
next generation internet backbone routers offer our customers increased
reliability performance scalability interoperability and flexibility and
reduced complexity and cost compared to current alternatives our products
combine high performance asicbased packet forwarding technology the features
of our junos internet software and an internetoptimized architecture into a
purposebuilt solution for the service provider market

industry background

        the internet has evolved from an academic research project into a
network of hundreds of separately administered public and private networks
interconnected using ip ip traffic is growing exponentially driven by
increasing numbers of new users connected devices and internet transactions
the result of the widespread use of ip is a ubiquitous network that today
carries a large and growing amount of data traffic enabling millions of users to
share information and conduct electronic commerce industry research firms
forecast continued dramatic growth worldwide in the internet and internet
traffic the importance of ip continues to increase as the number of users
connected devices and transactions over the internet grows

        the rapid adoption of the internet and the tremendous growth of ip
traffic have prompted service providers to construct large scale data networks
these networks are being optimized to transport data traffic as compared to
traditional telephone networks which were optimized to transport voice traffic
the architecture of these next generation networks is being driven by two key
technologies packetcell switching and optical networking

        advantages of packetcell switching packetcell switching technology
which divides data traffic into distinct units called packets or cells and
routes each packet or cell independently provides superior use of available
network capacity compared to traditional circuit switching technology in a
circuit switched network each data stream such as a voice telephone call
between two points is provided with a dedicated channel or circuit for the
duration of the telephone call this approach leads to inefficient use of
network resources because a channel is fully dedicated to each transaction
whether or not data is actually flowing at any given moment as a result a
circuit switched architecture is highly inefficient for internet applications
which tend to create large bursts of data traffic followed by long periods of
silence packetcell switching architectures enable greater utilization out of a
fixed capacity circuit by combining traffic that has different capacity demands
of the circuit at different times packetcell switches more efficiently fill
the available network bandwidth with packets of data from many users thereby
reducing the wasted bandwidth due to silence from any one particular user the
use of packetcell switching is driving the architecture of the internet to be
fundamentally different from traditional circuit switched voice based networks
in packetcell switched networks ip has emerged as the de facto standard for
providing services to end users primary packetcell switching products include
frame relay switches atm switches and routers

        rapid advances in optical networking optical networking technology uses
pulses of light rather than pulses of electricity to transmit data in a
network and uses fiber optic connections instead of wires optical networking
can be used to transmit much more information over a given connection than
electrical signals can convey optical networking advances such as dense
wavelength division multiplexing or dwdm which allows transmission of several
frequencies of light over one strand of optical fiber have enabled still higher
data transmission rates and improved efficiency of bandwidth utilization

        packetcell technologies have not kept up with optical technologies
many service providers are installing dwdm equipment and are increasingly
focusing on combining ip and optical networking technologies however
traditional packet switching equipment is not capable of forwarding packets at
rates sufficient to keep pace with optical transmission speeds

page   4

as affordable fiber optic transmission capacity becomes widely available the
performance and complexity of current packetcell switching architectures is
increasingly constraining the growth of the internet

fundamental requirements for the internet

        the reliability and performance of current internet infrastructure
equipment have become and continue to be critical issues for service providers
as they support dramatic growth in ip traffic and increasingly seek to offer new
revenue generating missioncritical and other services the need for high
reliability high performance high performance under stressful conditions
scalability interoperability and cost effectiveness are fundamental
requirements in meeting the needs associated with the growth in ip traffic new
requirements will continue to arise for next generation networks which will
drive a set of new requirements for internet infrastructure equipment

        high reliability as businesses and consumers increasingly rely on the
internet for missioncritical applications high network reliability becomes
essential service providers are increasingly expected to provide a similar
degree of reliability on the internet that users have become accustomed to on
the traditional telephone network the five nines 99999 reliability
standard of the traditional telephone network is becoming the target to which
suppliers of nextgeneration internet platforms are being compared as service
providers begin to bundle voice and data on their networks this high degree of
reliability is becoming even more critical

        high performance to handle the rapid growth in ip traffic todays
networks increasingly require routers that can operate at higher speeds the
processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated
forwarding technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination
based on priority data type and other considerations since a large number of
ip packets many of which perform critical administrative functions are small
in size high performance internet routers need to achieve their specified
transmission speeds even for small packet sizes since smaller packets increase
packet processing demands routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be
more resource intensive than routing of larger packets a wire speed router
which achieves its specified transmission rate for any type of traffic passing
through it can accomplish this task thus provisioning of missioncritical
services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed
processing

        high performance under stressful conditions in a large and complex
network individual components inevitably fail however the failure of an
individual device or link must not compromise the network as a whole in a
typical network when a failure occurs the network loses some degree of
capacity and in turn a greater load falls on the remaining network routers
which must provide alternate routes routers must quickly adjust to the new
state of the network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping
significant numbers of packets when active routes are lost or when large numbers
of routes change routing protocols are used to accomplish this convergence a
process that places even greater stress on the router given the complexity of
internet infrastructure particularly compared to enterprise networks the
convergence process is far more complex and places a far greater load on the
routing software thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device

        scalability due to the rapid growth in internet users and ip traffic
service providers must continuously expand their networks both in terms of
increased numbers of access points of presence pops and also greater capacity
per pop to facilitate this expansion process internet infrastructure equipment
must be highly scalable next generation routers therefore need to be
upgradeable and configurable to function within constantly changing networks
while incurring minimal downtime

        interoperability service providers do not have the time or inclination
to change their existing networks to favor introduction of new products rather
new products must be compatible with the existing environment given the open
and interconnected nature of the internet the complexity of running an
internet backbone network requires a service provider to control and police
relations with other service providers for example service providers must
carefully control what traffic is accepted under what conditions from other
providers the software in each router must offer 100 compatibility with the
interior protocols and standards used within each service providers backbone
network the compatibility level must be maintained despite changes to software
equipment configuration and network architecture and upgrades to the various
protocol standards thus routing software must be flexible and quickly
upgradeable to support any necessary revisions this level of compatibility in
turn cannot impact the performance scalability or reliability of the
equipment attaining this sophisticated level of interoperability is highly
challenging and requires significant testing to ensure compatibility


                                       4

        cost effectiveness exponential growth in ip traffic and intense price
competition in the telecommunications market is increasingly requiring service
providers to seek solutions that significantly reduce the capital expenditures
required to build and operate their networks in addition to the basic cost of
equipment such as routers service providers incur substantial ancillary costs
in terms of space required to deploy the equipment power consumption and
ongoing operations and maintenance service providers therefore want to deploy
dense and varied equipment configurations in limited amounts of rack and floor
space therefore in order to continue to scale their networks toward higher
data speeds in a cost effective manner service providers need the ability to
mix and match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities
without significantly increasing the consumption of space or power

        there is a clear need for next generation routers that can support high
speeds and offer new ipbased services network operators are eagerly seeking
new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within
their networks and reduce the cost of their architectures


the juniper networks solution

        we developed marketed and sold the first commercially available
purposebuilt internet backbone router optimized for the specific high
performance needs of service providers as the need for core bandwidth
continued to increase the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the
network was created our products are designed to address the needs at the core
and at the edge of the network by combining the features of highperformance
asicbased packet forwarding technology our junos internet software and an
internetoptimized architecture

        our product platforms share common software and services and common
asic technology for full compatibility and scalability critical service
provider applications including highspeed access peering and hosting are
served by our platforms physical interfaces are interchangeable between
platforms increasing user flexibility and allowing common sparing our solution
provides several key benefits to our customers carrier class reliability wire
speed performance scalability interoperability flexibility reduced
complexity and cost effectiveness

        junos internet software our internet software called junos is
designed to meet the ip network routing operations and control requirements of
the worlds largest service providers and is an integral embedded component of
our product family system architecture the ability of junos to manage the
complex network sharing relationships among service providers allows our
products to be placed at critical points in the core of a service providers
network the junos internet software allows our products to have widespread
network placement due to its interoperability with ciscos internetwork
operating system or ios currently the most broadly deployed routing operating
system

        unconstrained by legacy routing software we developed junos using a
modular design in which distinct functions are implemented as separate modules
with well defined interfaces and interactions simplifying troubleshooting and
maintenance junos operates in protected memory mode these features keep
functionality distinct and minimize the impact of any failure that may occur to
the specific software application in which the failure occurs also we believe
junos software modularity will enable the continuous upgrade of new enhanced
capabilities while protecting reliability and compatibility with existing
networks

        high performance asicbased packet forwarding technology our products
utilize high performance asicbased technology the result is a platform that is
substantially faster than todays general purpose microprocessor based routers
in its ability to process and forward ip packets allowing our products to
deliver high performance at wire speed the ability to enhance and implement
large scale asics will be a longterm differentiator for us particularly as the
sophistication required to forward traffic across higher speed networks
increases we expect to continue to leverage our existing asic technology in
future products and continue to capitalize on our advanced asic design
capabilities

        internet optimized architecture as purposebuilt internet backbone
routers our products employ an architecture designed exclusively for the
internet the system architecture provides a clean separation between the
routing and packetforwarding functions separating these two functions enables
us to develop independently a fullfeatured routing protocol and traffic
engineering functionality through our junos internet software and wire speed
packet forwarding performance through high performance asics furthermore with
the routing and forwarding functions segregated the products do not sacrifice
performance even when there is a failure in the network when a failure occurs
junos detects the failure and is


                                       5

able to quickly converge to the new state of the network while the asics
continue to forward packets at wire speed until they receive updated routes from
junos

the juniper networks strategy

        our objective is to become the primary supplier of high performance
internet backbone infrastructure the key elements of our strategy are described
below

        maintain and extend technology leadership our asic technology junos
internet software and internetoptimized architecture have been key elements to
establishing our technology leadership we believe that these elements are
highly leverageable into future products we are currently developing we intend
to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the internet
infrastructure market through continued significant investment to enhance the
feature richness of our products and to develop future differentiated offerings
for service providers

        leverage early lead as supplier of purposebuilt internet
infrastructure from inception we have focused solely on designing and building
internet infrastructure for service providers we have integrated purposebuilt
software and hardware into an internet optimized architecture that specifically
meets service providers needs and have seen significantly positive initial
responses from our existing and potential customers we believe that many of
these customers will deploy internet backbone infrastructure equipment from only
a few vendors the purposebuilt advantages of our products provide us with a
timetomarket lead which is a critical advantage in gaining rapid penetration
as one of these selected vendors once our products are widely deployed in a
service providers network as the primary or even secondary internet backbone
infrastructure equipment we believe we create a significant barrier to entry to
potential competitors who do not currently offer commerciallyviable next
generation routing solutions

        work very closely with key customers in developing our products
including our junos internet software we worked very closely with customers to
design and build a product specifically to meet their complex needs since junos
has been available and used by our customers for over two years we understand
clearly the challenges facing these carriers enabling us to subsequently design
additional features and capabilities into both our software and hardware we
believe our close relationships with and constant feedback from our customers
have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date we plan
to continue to work very closely with our key customers to implement
enhancements to current products as well as to design future products that
specifically meet their evolving needs we are also actively involved with these
customers in developing key standards such as mpls and are an active
participant in standards organizations such as the internet engineering task
force and the optical internetworking forum

        increase penetration at major service providers our initial focus has
been to penetrate several of the largest service providers where operators have
the technical sophistication resources and desire to test and evaluate our
solution against potential alternatives we believe that there is a significant
opportunity to further penetrate these large and complex networks given the
advantages of our products as the growth of the internet requires these major
service providers to continue to build their networks and replace outdated
equipment we will pursue further opportunities to capture greater market share
within these large accounts

        leverage early successes to penetrate new customers rapidly we believe
that the internet infrastructure equipment buying patterns of the medium and
smallersized service providers typically lag behind those of the larger service
providers since the network challenges that the large service providers face
today are likely to be the problems encountered by smaller service providers in
the near future we believe smaller service providers are likely to deploy
equipment similar to larger service providers furthermore smaller service
providers often lack the technical resources to thoroughly test different
vendors products therefore they typically piggyback on larger service
providers evaluation efforts by purchasing the same platforms deployed by the
larger service providers since we have begun to sell to several of the largest
service providers we intend to leverage this success by allocating our
marketing efforts towards a greater number of medium and smallersized service
providers

        enable new ipbased services our platform enables service providers to
build networks cost effectively and to offer new differentiated services for
their customers more efficiently than conventional products while we believe
that current service providers are likely to be the largest and most successful
ip network operators in the near term many new service providers are likely to
emerge oriented around the delivery of ipbased services these services which
include web hosting outsourced internet and intranet services vpns outsourced
enterprise applications and voiceover ip are costeffectively enabled by our
internet infrastructure platform although the market for our products today is
driven primarily by the need for traditional internet network capacity as other
ipbased services and applications continue to grow in importance the total
potential market for our products will continue to grow commensurately

technology

        our core technology consists of our internet backbone router
architecture junos internet software and asic hardware expertise our
generalpurpose architecture was initially embodied in the m40 but also is
designed to serve as the platform for our m20 m160 m5 m10 and for future
generations of products

product architecture

        the architecture of our products is exemplified by the m40 the m40
architecture delivers the forwarding rates and network control necessary to
scale internet backbones rapidly and reliably the m40 system includes a routing
engine or re and a packet forwarding engine or pfe the clean separation of
the routing and forwarding functions ensures that the two functions do not
compete for the same resources

        the routing engine the re consists of the junos internet software
operating on an intelbased platform the junos internet software features
internetscale protocol support with flexible policy software that enables
maximum control over the acceptance modification and advertisement of route
prefixes in addition the junos internet software offers a range of
configuration management tools that simplify the configuration process and help
protect against operator error the re conducts the processing intensive
activity of maintaining the routing table from which the forwarding table
residing in the pfe is derived the re is connected to the pfe through a
dedicated 100 mbps link after constructing or updating the forwarding table
the re downloads a copy of the table to the pfe updates to the forwarding table
are done atomically in small incremental steps so that packet forwarding is not
interrupted by routing changes

        the packet forwarding engine the m40 delivers wire speed packet
forwarding using our asic designs all links between asics are oversized
dedicated channels and the pfe architecture is free from the bottlenecks faced
by traditional crossbar switches which use intelligent agent software to
perform both routing and forwarding functions over multiple connections to
either parts of the network bottlenecks can occur in a crossbar switch because
the routing and forwarding functions are not separated the heart of the pfe is
the internet processor asic

        all lookup rates reflect longestmatch route table lookups for all
packets and all lookups are performed in hardware there is no caching
mechanism which is a mechanism by which critical information such as
destinations for traffic is stored in rapidly accessible memory to make the
process of looking up traffic destinations faster in addition there is no risk
of cache misses in the system which can result in slower storage access and thus
considerably slower traffic delivery in addition the forwarding table can be
updated without affecting forwarding rates the internet processor is
programmable to support up to four different forwarding tables layer 2 andor
layer 3 simultaneously supported forwarding protocols currently include
unicast and multicast ipv4 and mpls finally the internet processor maintains
its performance regardless of length of lookups or table size


                                       7
page   8

        the pfe also features a shared memory system with singlestage
buffering so packets are written to and read from memory only once
singlestage buffering greatly reduces the complexities and throughput delays
associated with multistage buffering systems the pooled memory is distributed
across the flexible pic concentrator or fpc cards allowing memory to scale as
interfaces are added the internet processor also features prefix accounting
mechanisms that operate at rates in excess of 20 mpps

junos internet software traffic engineering and control

        junos internet software offers a full suite of internetscale
internettested routing protocols protocols and software tools which are used
to control and direct network traffic are critical to an internet backbone
routing solution software control is made more important by the fact that the
size and complexity of backbone networks are increasing at a time when service
providers are looking to differentiate themselves through valueadded service
offerings

        junos internet software features implementations of all major internet
protocols including bgp4 dvmrp pim isis open shortest path first isis
and open shortest path first are algorithms broadly used in enterprise networks
and by service providers to determine and update the running state of the
network and available destinations in the network these implementations were
developed inhouse by our design team which has extensive experience in
addressing the scaling issues of rapidly growing service providers

        junos internet software also provides a new level of traffic engineering
capabilities with its implementation of mpls developed in conjunction with the
internet engineering task force our mpls capability offers enhanced visibility
into traffic patterns and the ability to control the path traffic takes through
the network path selection enables service providers to engineer traffic for
efficient use of network capacity and avoidance of congestion we expect mpls
and its traffic engineering capabilities to become a crucial tool for service
providers as they scale their networks

        junos internet software features a modular design with separate
programs running in protected memory space in conjunction with an independent
operating system unlike monolithic unprotected operating system designs which
are prone to system wide failure the protected modular approach improves
reliability by ensuring that modifications made to one module have no unwanted
sideeffects on other sections of the software in addition having clean
software interfaces between modules facilitates software development and
maintenance enabling faster response to customer needs and delivery of new
features

        junos internet software has been extensively tested in multiple service
provider networks to ensure compatibility with ciscos ios since each major
service providers network is different this extensive testing is necessary to
ensure seamless introduction into existing service provider environments

customers

        our customers include end users value added resellers and an original
equipment manufacturer we recognize revenue from the shipment of products at
the time of shipment unless we have future obligations for network
interoperability or if we have to obtain customer acceptance in those cases we
defer recognition of the revenue and related costs until we have met our
obligations

        one customer worldcom inc accounted for approximately 18 of our
recognized revenues for the year ended december 31 2000

sales and marketing

        we sell and market our products primarily through our direct sales
organization valueadded resellers and an original equipment manufacturer

        direct sales our north american direct sales organization is divided
into regional operations with our direct sales efforts focused on the largest
service providers the direct sales account managers cover the market on an
assigned account basis and work as a team with account oriented systems
engineers they are directed by a regional operations manager who reports to the
north american vice president of sales we also have technical


                                       8
page   9

engineers that consult with and provide our customers with guidance and
assistance on the evolution of their networks as it relates to the deployment of
our products these consulting engineers also help in defining the features that
are required for our products to be successful in specific applications a key
feature of our sales effort is the relationship we establish at various levels
in our customers organization our sales team maintains contact with key
individuals who have service planning and infrastructure buildout
responsibility

        value added resellers we have complemented our direct sales effort in
the united states through the addition of several highly focused value added
resellers our arrangements with value added resellers typically have been
nonexclusive and provide the value added reseller with discounts based upon the
volume of their orders

        original equipment manufacturer partner we have established a strategic
distribution relationship with ericsson we believe that ericsson has
significant customer relationships in place and offers products which complement
ours ericsson will provide the first level of support to its customers our
agreement with ericsson allows it to distribute our products on a worldwide
nonexclusive basis with discounts based upon the volume of orders it receives

        international resellers in order to further our international sales
objectives we have established a number of country specific value added
resellers these resellers have expertise in deploying complex internet
infrastructure equipment in their respective markets and provide the first level
of support required by our international customers in addition we have
established strategic value added reseller relationships with alcatel and nortel
to sell and service our products on a worldwide nonexclusive basis

        as of december 31 2000 we employed 290 people in our sales and
marketing organizations

customer service and support

        we believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the
successful installation and ongoing support of our products and we have hired
support engineers with proven internet experience to provide those services we
offer the following services 24 hours a day seven days a week technical
assistance online telephone and onsite professional services educational
services logistics services and webbased information

        we offer a variety of flexible and comprehensive support programs
including basic hardware and software warranty services next day onsite parts
and labor 24 hours a day seven days a week same day parts and labor and
onsite resident engineers we deliver these services directly to major end
users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities
of our partners and third party organizations we also train our partners in the
delivery of education and support services

        customer service and support provide front line product support and is
the problem resolution interface to our partners and direct end users if
customer service and support are unable to resolve an issue themselves they
duplicate the problem scenario and provide the failure information such as
logs dumps traces and system configuration to appropriate subject matter
experts in our engineering department

        based on the severity of the problem and the impact to our customers
network there are strict escalation guidelines to ensure that the appropriate
technical resource and management attention is brought to bear on the problem in
a timeframe commensurate with problem priority the overall goal is to fix the
problem at the appropriate level in the right timeframe in order to ensure our
customers satisfaction

        as of december 31 2000 we employed 134 people in our customer service
and support organization with the majority located in our sunnyvale california
corporate headquarters

research and development

        we have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience
in the fields of high end computing network system design internet routing
protocols and embedded software these individuals have been drawn from leading
computer data networking and telecommunications companies in addition to
building complex hardware and software systems the engineering team has
experience in delivering very large highly integrated asics and extremely
scalable internet software


                                       9
page   10

        our research and development department is organized into teams that
work in parallel on several projects in a manner similar to the development of
successive generations of complex microprocessors as a result we will seek to
offer our customers next generation products as they are needed

        we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to
our strategy of enhancing our core technology developing additional
applications incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness
of our product and service offerings we are leveraging our first generation
asics developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customer
applications and continuing to develop next generation technology to support the
anticipated growth in network bandwidth requirements we continue to expand the
functionality of our junos internet software to improve performance and
scalability and to provide an enhanced user interface

        our research and development process is driven by the availability of
new technology market demand and customer feedback we have invested
significant time and resources in creating a structured process for undertaking
all product development projects this process involves all functional groups
and all levels within our company following an assessment of market demand our
research and development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional
product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales
organizations this process is designed to provide a framework for defining and
addressing the steps tasks and activities required to bring product concepts
and development projects to market

        as of december 31 2000 we employed 305 people in our research and
development organization

        our research and development expenses totaled 878 million for the year
ended december 31 2000 415 million for the year ended december 31 1999 and
240 million for the year ended december 31 1998

manufacturing

     our manufacturing operation is entirely outsourced we have developed
manufacturing relationships with solectron and celestica under which we have
subcontracted our manufacturing activity this subcontracting activity extends
from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material
procurement final assembly test control and shipment to our customers we
design specify and monitor all of the tests that are required to meet internal
and external quality standards these arrangements provide us with the following
benefits

         we operate without dedicating any space to manufacturing operations

         we conserve the working capital that would be required for funding
          inventory

         we can adjust manufacturing volumes quickly to meet changes in demand
          and

         we can quickly deliver products to customers with turnkey
          manufacturing and drop shipment capabilities

        our asics are manufactured by ibm who is responsible for all aspects of
the production of the asics using our proprietary designs

competition

        competition in the internet infrastructure market is intense the market
historically has been dominated by cisco systems inc with other companies
such as nortel networks and lucent technologies inc providing products to a
smaller segment of the market in addition a number of public and private
companies have announced plans for new products to address the same problems
which our products address

        cisco traditionally has been the dominant supplier of solutions to this
market we believe this is the result of its early leadership position in the
enterprise router market as the internet has grown rapidly cisco has leveraged
this position and has developed a broad product line of routers which support
all major local area and wide area interfaces we believe that our ability to
compete with cisco depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are
superior in meeting the needs of service providers and are extremely compatible
with ciscos current and future products although we believe that we are
currently among the top providers of internet infrastructure solutions
worldwide we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully
with cisco currently the leading provider in this market


                                       10
page   11

        we expect that over time large companies with significant resources
technical expertise market experience customer relationships and broad product
lines such as lucent and nortel will introduce new products which are designed
to compete more effectively in this market as a result we expect to face
increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly
more resources than we have although we believe that our technology and the
purposebuilt features of our products make them unique and will enable us to
compete effectively with these companies we cannot assure you that we will be
successful

        many of our current and potential competitors such as cisco lucent and
nortel have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their
products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage
customers from purchasing our products also many of our current and potential
competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that
could be leveraged increased competition could result in price reduction fewer
customer orders reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which
could seriously harm our operating results

        there are also many small public and private companies which claim to
have products with greater capabilities than our products consolidation in this
industry has begun with one or more of these smaller private companies being
acquired by large established suppliers of internet infrastructure products
and we believe it is likely to continue as a result we expect to face
increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly
more resources than we have

        several companies also provide solutions which can substitute for some
uses of routers for example high bandwidth asynchronous transfer mode atm
switches are used in the core of certain major backbone service providers atm
switches can carry a variety of traffic types including voice video and data
using fixed 53 byte cells companies that use atm switches are enhancing their
products with new software technologies such as multiprotocol label switching
or mpls which can potentially simplify the task of mixing routers and switches
in the same network these substitutes can reduce the need for large numbers of
routers

intellectual property

        our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our
internally developed technology and knowhow we have two patents issued relating
to high speed switching devices these patents will expire in 2016 in addition
we have over 40 patent applications pending in the united states relating to the
design of our products our engineering teams have significant expertise in asic
design and we own all rights to the design of the asics which form the core of
our products our junos internet software was developed internally and is
protected by united states and other copyright laws

        while we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark law to
protect our technology we also believe that factors such as the technological
and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product
enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and
maintaining a technology leadership position there can be no assurance that
others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our
technology

        our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary
intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights while
we have filed patent applications we cannot be certain that these applications
will issue into patents that we will be able to obtain the necessary
intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our
intellectual property rights

employees

        as of december 31 2000 we had 927 fulltime employees 305 of whom
were engaged in research and development 290 in sales and marketing 134 in
customer support and 198 in finance administration it and operations none of
our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced any work
stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

        our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued
service of our key technical sales and senior management personnel none of
whom is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined
period of time the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees
could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and
results of operations our future success also depends on our continuing ability
to attract train and


                                       11
page   12

retain highly qualified technical sales and managerial personnel competition
for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain
our key personnel in the future

                                  risk factors

we face intense competition that could reduce our market share or slow the rate
of increase in market share

        competition in the internet infrastructure market is intense this
market has historically been dominated by cisco with other companies such as
nortel networks and lucent technologies providing products to a smaller segment
of the market in addition a number of other small public and private companies
have announced plans for new products to address the same problems which our
products address if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and
future competitors we could be required to reduce prices resulting in reduced
gross margins and we could experience loss of market share or a reduction in
the rate of increase of market share each of which could materially and
adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition

our success depends on our ability to develop products and product enhancements
that will achieve market acceptance

        we cannot ensure that we will be able to develop new products or product
enhancements in a timely manner or at all any failure to develop new products
or product enhancements could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales
of our present and future products which would significantly harm the business
and financial results even if we are able to develop and commercially introduce
new products and enhancements there can be no assurance that new products or
enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance any failure of our
future products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect the business
and financial results


our failure to increase our revenues would prevent us from maintaining
profitability

        although our net revenues have grown from 1026 million for the year
ended december 31 1999 to 6735 million for the year ended december 31 2000
we cannot be certain that our revenues will continue to grow we have large
fixed expenses and expect to continue to incur significant and increasing sales
and marketing engineering and product development and administrative expenses
and there can be no assurances that net revenues will continue to grow or that
we will maintain profitability

our limited operating history makes forecasting difficult

        as a result of our limited operating history it is difficult to
accurately forecast revenues and there is limited meaningful historical
financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses in addition our
operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high
percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the
shortterm if we do not achieve our expected revenues our operating results
will be below our expectations and those of investors and market analysts which
could cause the price of the common stock to decline

        in addition timing of deployment of our products can vary widely and
depends on various factors customers with large networks usually expand their
networks in large increments on a periodic basis we expect to receive
significant orders on an irregular basis because of our limited operating
history we cannot predict these sales and development cycles these long
cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically
place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenues and operating
results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter

        further we have experienced and expect to continue to experience in the
foreseeable future limited visibility as to our customers spending plans and
capital budgets this limited visibility complicates the forecasting process
further

although our customer base has increased substantially there is still a limited
number of customers which comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any
decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect

        we expect that a large portion of our net revenues will continue to
depend on sales to a limited number of customers any downturn in the business
of these customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales
to such customers which could adversely affect our net revenues and results of
operations


                                       12

if we fail to manage expansion effectively we could seriously harm our business
financial condition and prospects

        our ability to successfully implement our business plan develop and
offer our products and manage expansion in a rapidly evolving market requires a
comprehensive and effective planning and management process we continue to
increase the scope of our operations domestically and internationally and have
grown headcount substantially the growth in business headcount and
relationships with customers and other third parties has placed and will
continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources
we will need to continue to improve our operational managerial and financial
controls reporting systems and procedures and will need to continue to expand
train and manage our work force worldwide

the long sales and implementation cycles for our products as well as our
expectation that customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead
times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from
quarter to quarter

        a customers decision to purchase our products involves a significant
commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification
process as a result our sales cycle may be lengthy throughout the sales
cycle we often spend considerable time educating and providing information to
prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of the products even after
making the decision to purchase our customers tend to deploy the products
slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the
skill set of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of
the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and software
configuration necessary to deploy the products customers with large networks
usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis
accordingly we expect to receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts
on an irregular basis because of our limited operating history we cannot
predict these sales and development cycles these long cycles as well as our
expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with
short lead times may cause our revenues and operating results to vary
significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly
changing market and if we are unable to hire additional personnel our ability
to sell products could be harmed

        our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive
officers and other key engineering sales marketing and support personnel none
of the officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any
specific term

        we also will need to continue to hire engineering and other personnel in
the future and we believe our success depends in large part upon our ability
to attract and retain these key employees competition for these persons is
intense especially in the san francisco bay area the loss of the services of
any of our key employees the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel
in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineers
could delay the development and introduction of our products

        in addition we believe that our future success is dependent upon
establishing successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners
we have entered into agreements with several value added resellers some of whom
also sell products that compete with our products we cannot be certain that we
will be able to reach agreement with additional resellers on a timely basis or
at all or that they will devote adequate resources to selling our products

we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key
components


                                       13
page   14

        with the current demand for electronic products component shortages are
possible and the predictability of the availability of such components is
limited we currently purchase several key components including asics from a
single source we may not be able to develop an alternate or second source in a
timely manner which could hurt our ability to deliver product to customers if
we are unable to buy these components on a timely basis we may not be able to
deliver product to our customers which would seriously impact present and
future sales which would in turn adversely affect our business

we currently depend on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have longterm
supply contracts and if we unexpectedly have to qualify a new contract
manufacturer we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships

        we depend on third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our
products we do not have a longterm supply contract with such manufacturers and
if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships
or if one or more of them should experiences delays disruptions or quality
control problems in our manufacturing operations our ability to ship products
to our customers could be delayed which could adversely affect our business and
financial results

if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur
additional costs or experience manufacturing delays

        we provide forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturers up to
six months prior to scheduled delivery of products to our customers if we
overestimate our requirements the contract manufacturer may have excess
inventory which would increase our costs if we underestimate our requirements
the contract manufacturer may have an inadequate inventory which could
interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and
revenues in addition lead times for materials and components we order vary
significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier contract
terms and demand for each component at a given time we also may experience
shortages of certain components from time to time which also could delay the
manufacturing of our products

the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading
price of our common stock

        our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter
to quarter due to a number of factors including many which are outside of our
control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate

        the factors that may impact the unpredictability of our quarterly
results include the long sales and implementation cycle and the continuing
increase in operating expenses in anticipation of increased revenues as a
result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of operating results are
not a good indication of future performance it is likely that in some future
quarters operating results may be below the expectations of public market
analysts and investors in this event the price of our common stock may fall
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a
high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the short
term as a result a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for the reasons
set forth above or for any other reason could cause significant variations in
our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial
operating losses

if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks installations
will be delayed or cancelled and could result in substantial product returns
which could harm our business

        our products are designed to interface with our customers existing
networks each of which has different specifications and utilizes multiple
protocol standards many of our customers networks contain multiple generations
of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and
evolved our products must interoperate with all of the products within these
networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers
requirements if we find errors in the existing software used in our customers
networks we must modify our junos internet software to fix or overcome these
errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing
software and hardware if our products do not interoperate with those of our
customers networks installations could be delayed orders for our products
could be cancelled or our products could be returned this would also seriously
harm our reputation which could seriously harm our business and prospects
because our products are complex and are deployed in complex environments they
may have errors or defects that we find only after full deployment which could
seriously harm our business


                                       14

        our products are highly complex and designed to be deployed in very
large and complex networks although we have thoroughly tested our products
because of the nature of the product it can only be fully tested when deployed
in very large networks with high amounts of traffic to date our products have
been deployed only on a limited basis consequently our customers may discover
errors or defects in the hardware or the software after it has been fully
deployed if we are unable to fix errors or other problems that may be
identified in full deployment we could experience among other things loss of
or delay in revenues and loss of market share loss of customers diversion of
development resources and increased service and warranty costs

customer product liability claims based on errors in our software or mistakes in
performing our services could result in costly litigation against us

        we may be subject to claims based on errors in our software or mistakes
in performing our services including claims relating to damages to our
customers internal systems our contracts with our customers generally contain
provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims
such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special
consequential and incidental damages we believe our product liability insurance
is adequate to cover potential product liability claims however a product
liability claim whether successful or not could seriously impact our capital
reserves harm our reputation and direct the attention of key personnel away
from our business any of which could harm our business

problems arising from use of our products in conjunction with other vendors
products could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition

        service providers typically use our products in conjunction with
products from other vendors as a result when problems occur it may be
difficult to identify the source of the problem these problems may cause us to
incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our
engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant
customer relations problems

our products are new and face rapid technological changes and evolving standards
and if we do not respond in a timely manner our business could be harmed

        the internet infrastructure market is characterized by rapid
technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer
requirements and evolving industry standards in developing our products we
have made and will continue to make assumptions with respect to which
standards will be adopted by our customers and competitors if the standards
adopted are different from those which we have chosen to support market
acceptance of our products may be significantly reduced or delayed and our
business will be seriously harmed in addition the introduction of products
embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could
render our existing products obsolete

        in addition in order to introduce products embodying new technologies
and new industry standards we must be able to gain access to the latest
technologies of our suppliers such as ibm any failure to gain access to the
latest technologies could harm our business and operating results

our failure to establish and maintain key customer relationships may result in
delays in introducing new products or cause customers to forego purchasing our
products

        our future success will also depend upon our ability to develop and
manage key customer relationships in order to introduce a variety of new
products and product enhancements that address the increasingly sophisticated
needs of our customers our failure to establish and maintain these customer
relationships may adversely affect our ability to develop new products and
product enhancements in addition we may experience delays in releasing new
products and product enhancements in the future material delays in introducing
new products and enhancements or our inability to introduce competitive new
products may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase
those of our competitors which could seriously harm our business

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could incur substantial costs in
defending ourselves


                                       15
page   16

        companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with
competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair
hiring practices we have received claims of this kind in the past and we cannot
assure you that we will not receive claims of this kind in the future as we seek
to hire qualified personnel or that those claims will not result in material
litigation we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against
these claims regardless of their merits

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our
intellectual property rights from thirdparty challenges

        we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade
secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property
rights we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our
employees consultants and corporate partners and control access to and
distribution of our software documentation and other proprietary information
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may
attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be
certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our
technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our
proprietary rights as fully as in the united states

necessary licenses of thirdparty technology may not be available to us or may
be very expensive

        from time to time we may be required to license technology from third
parties to develop new products or product enhancements we cannot assure you
that third party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable
terms if at all the inability to obtain any thirdparty license required to
develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain
substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater
cost either of which could seriously harm our business financial condition and
results of operations

we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights
which could seriously harm our business

        in recent years there has been significant litigation in the united
states involving patents and other intellectual property rights although we are
not involved in any intellectual property litigation we may be a party to
litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of
an alleged infringement of others intellectual property claims for alleged
infringement and any resulting lawsuit if successful could subject us to
significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights
these lawsuits regardless of their success would likely be timeconsuming and
expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention any
potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more
of the following

         stop selling incorporating or using our products that use the
          challenged intellectual property

         obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a
          license to sell or use the relevant technology which license may not
          be available on reasonable terms or at all or

         redesign those products that use such technology

if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions our business may be
seriously harmed although we carry general liability insurance our insurance
may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify
us for all liability that may be imposed

we face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our
financial condition and results of operations

        we market sell and service our products in the united states and
internationally we have established offices throughout europe and in the asia
pacific region we will continue to expand our international operations and
enter new international markets this expansion will require significant
management attention and financial resources to develop successfully direct and
indirect international sales and support channels we may not be able to
maintain or increase international market demand for our products

        international operations are subject to inherent risks including
greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection
periods difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations the
impact of recessions in economies outside the united states unexpected changes
in regulatory requirements certification requirements reduced


                                       16

protection for intellectual property rights in some countries potentially
adverse tax consequences and political and economic instability

        our international revenues were 2358 million for the year ended
december 31 2000 and are denominated in us dollars consequently we do not
currently engage in currency hedging activities however a portion of our
international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future

any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial
condition

        we intend to make investments in complementary companies products or
technologies in the event of any such investments or acquisitions we could
issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership
incur debt assume liabilities incur amortization expenses related to goodwill
and other intangible assets or incur large and immediate writeoffs

        these acquisitions also involve numerous risks including problems
combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated
costs diversion of managements attention from our core business adverse
effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks
associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior
experience and potential loss of key employees particularly those of the
acquired organizations we cannot assure you that we will be able to
successfully integrate any businesses products technologies or personnel that
we might acquire in the future

risks related to the 475 subordinated convertible notes due march 15 2007

        last year the company completed an offering the debt offering of
475 subordinated convertible notes due march 15 2007 the convertible
notes in connection with the convertible notes the company is subject to
certain risks in addition to those described above those additional risks
include the following

                     substantial leverage and debt service
                obligations may adversely affect our cash flow

        as a result of the debt offering we have a substantial amount of
outstanding indebtedness as a result of this indebtedness our principal and
interest payment obligations have increased substantially there is the
possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the
principal of interest on and other amounts due with respect to the convertible
notes when due we may also add additional equipment loans and lease lines to
finance capital expenditures and may obtain additional longterm debt working
capital lines of credit and lease lines

            our substantial leverage could have significant negative
                            consequences including

         increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
          conditions

         limiting our ability to obtain additional financing

         requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash
          flow from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the
          amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes
          including capital expenditures

         limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in
          our business and the industry in which we compete and

         placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less
          leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to
          capital resources
