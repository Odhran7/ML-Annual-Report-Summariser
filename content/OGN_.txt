intellectual property 

patents trademarks and licenses

in particular organon considers the patents that cover the rod technology in nexplanon to be material to organons business such device patents will expire in 2027 in the united states and in 2025 in other countries around the world there are currently no contested proceedings or thirdparty claims that involve these patents organon has been granted a license from merck for nexplanon  implanon nxt that permits use of the underlying technology solely as a contraceptive implant containing only the active pharmaceutical ingredient currently used in the product additionally in december 2021 organon signed a supplemental license with merck that provides a limited expansion of the fields in which it may use the underlying technology of nexplanon  implanon nxt beyond contraception in exchange for milestone payments 

while the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product commercial benefits may continue to be derived from i latergranted patents on processes and intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product ii patents relating to the use or delivery of such product iii patents relating to novel compositions and formulations and iv in the 

table of conten ts 

united states and certain other countries market or data exclusivity that may be available under relevant law the effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it the growth of the market the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or similar laws and regulations in other countries 

additions to market or data exclusivity are sought in the united states and other countries through all relevant laws including laws increasing patent life some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by an increase in the number of incentives for and use of generic products additionally improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the united states and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation of international treaties 

for further information with respect to organons patents see the sections entitled risk factors and note 12 contingencies—patent litigation to the financial statements included in this report

competition 

the markets in which organon conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated organons competitors include other worldwide researchbased pharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers organons operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as organons products mature as well as technological advances of competitors industry consolidation patents granted to competitors competitive combination products new products of competitors the generic availability of competitors branded products and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or postmarketing surveillance in addition patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors and the outcome can be highly uncertain an adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown 

to remain competitive the additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control flexibility to meet buyer specifications an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service organon plans to acquire and market products through external alliances such as licensing arrangements and collaborations and has designed its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions however the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements even for products protected by patents

other legislative changes 

in addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the aca was enacted these changes include automatic 2 aggregate reductions in medicare payments to providers which results in an overall reduction in physician reimbursement from 106 of average sales price asp to 1043 of asp this change is part of the federal budget sequestration under the budget control act of 2011 which went into effect in april 2013 the sequestration was temporarily halted from may 1 2020 to march 31 2022 as a result of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act and the protecting medicare and american farmers from sequester cuts act pmafsca the cares act extended sequestration through fiscal year 2030 and the pmafsca will phasein a 1 sequestration from april 1 2022 to june 30 2022 the pmafsca further provides that a 225 sequestration would apply to payments made during the first six months of fiscal year 2030 and a 3 sequestration would apply to payments made during the final six months of fiscal year 2030 organon cannot predict how these and future adjustments to sequestration and the way in which these laws impact physician reimbursement for organons products will affect organons profitability

organon also faces increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations government agencies and programs that could negatively affect organons sales and profit margins including in the united states i practices of managed care organizations federal and state exchanges and institutional and governmental purchasers and ii federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the aca for example in november 2020 the oig issued a final rule that would have effective january 1 2022 eliminated the antikickback statute safe harbor for rebates paid to medicare part d plans or to pharmacy benefit managers pbms on behalf of such plans the effectiveness of this final rule was delayed as part of the infrastructure investment and jobs act which was signed into law on november 15 2021 and requires the secretary of health and human services not to implement administer or enforce the provisions of the final rule prior to january 1 2026 in addition on november 19 2021 the house of representatives passed a version of the build back better act that includes a provision prohibiting the implementation administration or enforcement of the final rule beginning on january 1 2026 as a result it remains to be seen whether and to what extent the provisions of this final rule will take effect while organon cannot anticipate the effects of these changes on the way organon currently contracts the new framework could significantly alter the way organon does business with part d plan sponsors and pbms on behalf of such plans 

in 2020 the fda issued a final rule implementing provisions of section 804 of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fdca which allows the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from canada through 

table of conten ts 

fdaauthorized timelimited programs sponsored by states or indian tribes and in certain future circumstances pharmacists and wholesalers at that time the fda also released a final guidance for industry detailing procedures for drug manufacturers to import fdaapproved prescription drug biological and combination products that were manufactured abroad and authorized and intended for sale in a foreign country a trade organization brought suit which remains pending in federal district court challenging the commercial importation final rule these changes could have a material adverse effect on organons business cash flow results of operations financial condition and prospects 

in the united states private sector consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products health plans and pbms have been consolidating into fewer larger entities thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance private thirdparty insurers as well as governments employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for organons products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue in addition to formulary tier copay differentials private health insurance companies and selfinsured employers have been raising copayments required from beneficiaries particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products private health insurance companies are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine these same management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payor has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable as the united states payor market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form pharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private thirdparty payors in addition other proposals that allow international reference pricing or under certain conditions the importation of medicines from other countries may be considered 

european union 

pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is not harmonized at the eu level but rather controlled by individual eu member states in addition a majority of countries in the eu attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine predetermined markets for published prices of drugs reference pricing may either compare a product’s prices in other markets external reference pricing or compare a product’s price with those of other products in a national class internal reference pricing the authorities then use the price data to set new local prices for brandname drugs including organons guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations some eu member states have established freepricing systems but regulate the pricing for drugs through profit control plans others seek to negotiate or set prices based on the costeffectiveness of a product or an assessment of whether it offers a therapeutic benefit over other products in the relevant class the downward pressure on health care costs in general particularly prescription drugs has become intense as a result increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products in some eu member states crossborder imports from lowpriced markets also exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within an eu member state 

additionally eu member states have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement in the eu reimbursement plans vary widely from eu member state to eu member state some eu member states provide that drug products may be marketed only after agreement on a reimbursement price some eu member states may require the completion of additional studies that compare the costeffectiveness of a particular product candidate to already available therapies or socalled health technology assessments hta to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval the hta of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in most eu member states the hta process which is governed by the national laws of these countries involves the assessment of the costeffectiveness public health impact therapeutic impact andor the economic and social impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national health care system of the individual country ultimately hta measures the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones the outcome of htas regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual eu member states a negative hta of one of organons products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or may force organon to reduce organons reimbursement price or offer discounts or rebates a negative hta by a leading and recognized hta body could also undermine organons ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a jurisdiction for example eu member states that have not yet developed hta mechanisms may rely to some extent on the hta performed in other countries with a developed hta framework to inform pricing and reimbursement decisions hta procedures require additional data reviews and administrative processes all of which increase the complexity timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement 

to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some eu member states organon may be required to conduct studies that compare the costeffectiveness of organons product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care there can be no assurance that any eu member state will allow favorable pricing reimbursement and market access conditions for any of organons products or that it will be feasible to conduct additional costeffectiveness studies if required

brexit 

in 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit as a result of that referendum and subsequent negotiations the uk left the eu on january 31 2020 a transitional period existed until december 31 2020 and during this period the eu and the uk operated as if the uk was an eu member state and the uk continued to participate in the eu customs union allowing for the freedom of movement for people and goods since january 1 2021 the uk has been treated as a third country ie not part of the eu single market or customs union and is no longer bound by any eu laws although the uk retained existing eu legislation in its national legislation however the northern irish protocol currently provides that certain eu laws have effect in northern ireland and that northern ireland is within the eu single market 

on december 24 2020 the eu and the uk agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement tca the tca sets out the new arrangements for trade of goods including medicines and vaccines which allows goods to continue to flow between the eu and the uk the tca provisionally applied from january 1 2021 and was permanently in force from may 1 2021 as a result of the tca organons operations have not been materially adversely affected by brexit 

japan 

in japan the pharmaceutical industry is subject to governmentmandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products furthermore the government can order repricings for specific products if it determines that use of such products will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable repricing rules 

china 

organons business in china has grown rapidly in the past few years and the importance of china to organons overall pharmaceutical business has increased accordingly continued growth of organons business in china is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products sustained access for organons current inline products and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls in recent years the chinese government has introduced and implemented several structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs since 2017 there have been multiple new policies introduced by the government to improve access to innovation reduce the complexity of regulatory filings and accelerate the review and approval process this has led to a significant increase in the number of new products being approved each year additionally in 2017 the chinese government updated the national reimbursement drug list for the first time in eight years while the mechanism for drugs being added to the list evolves inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands in 2020 drugs were added to the national reimbursement drug list through doubledigit price reductions 

while pricing pressure has always existed in china health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volumebased procurement vbp in 2019 the government implemented the vbp program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic substitutes with a generic quality consistency evaluation approval mature products that have entered into the first six rounds of vbp have had on average a price reduction of approximately 50 organon expects vbp to be a semiannual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward 

other markets 

organons focus on other markets has continued governments in many other markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property including in exceptional cases threats of compulsory licenses that aim to put pressure on the price of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in constrained market access to innovative medicine organon anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to varying degrees in such markets 

beyond pricing and market access challenges other conditions in certain countries outside the united states can affect organons efforts to continue to grow in these markets including potential political instability changes in trade sanctions and embargoes significant currency fluctuation and controls financial crises limited or changing availability of funding for health care credit worthiness of health care partners such as hospitals due to covid19 and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for organon further organon may engage thirdparty agents to assist in operating in such markets which may affect organons ability to realize continued growth and may also increase organons risk exposure 

in addressing cost containment pressures organon engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care organon advocates with government policymakers to encourage a longterm approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures 

table of conten ts 

access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings in markets with historically low rates of health care spending organon encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms to improve their citizens access to appropriate health care including medicines 

regulation of organons products 

the pharmaceutical and medical device industries are also subject to regulation by regional country state and local agencies around the world focused on standards and processes for determining drug and device safety and effectiveness as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement 

of particular importance is the fda in the united states which administers requirements covering the testing approval safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals and medical devices in some cases the fda requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the united states at the same time the fda has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the breakthrough therapy designation and established other expedited programs to support the development review and approval of medicines where there is unmet medical need in serious and lifethreatening conditions the fda has also undertaken efforts to bring generic and biosimilar competition to market more efficiently and in a timelier manner 

the eu has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification approval for marketing labeling advertising manufacturing wholesale distribution integrity of the supply chain pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring of medicinal products for human use these provide mandatory standards throughout the eu which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the eu member states in particular eu regulators may approve products subject to several postauthorization conditions examples of typical postauthorization commitments include additional pharmacovigilance the conduct of clinical trials the establishment of patient registries physician or patient education and controlled distribution and prescribing arrangements noncompliance with postauthorization conditions pharmacovigilance and other obligations can lead to regulatory action including the variation suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations or other enforcement or regulatory actions including the imposition of financial penalties organons policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives consequently organon believes that they will not have any material effect on organons business 

organon believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations including launching new drugs and devices in this regulatory environment 

fda regulation 

drugs and biologics 

industry practice and government regulations in the united states and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds suitable for pharmaceutical use through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation before a new drug may be marketed in the united states recorded data on preclinical and clinical investigations are included in the new drug application nda for a drug or the biologics license application bla for a biologic and submitted to the fda for the required approval 

once scientists identify internal technology development opportunities or external technology licensing opportunities to enable improvement of existing products or development of new products preclinical testing with that compound is commenced preclinical testing includes laboratory testing and safety studies in animals to gather data on chemistry pharmacology immunogenicity and toxicology and must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations pending acceptable preclinical data organon will submit an investigational new drug ind application to the fda through a combination of internal and external resources which includes the results of preclinical testing information about the drug composition and manufacturing and organons plan for clinical testing on humans after submission of the ind organon must wait 30 days before initiating clinical testing so that the fda can review the ind and determine that clinical testing will not expose human subjects to unreasonable risk the fda may impose a full or partial hold on an ind before or after it goes into effect requiring that organon halt clinical testing in accordance with the hold once an ind goes into effect organon will then initiate clinical testing under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with established regulatory requirements including good clinical practice regulations the clinical testing typically begins with phase 1 studies which are designed to assess safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans if favorable additional larger phase 2 studies are initiated to determine evidence of the efficacy of the compound in the affected population and define appropriate dosing for the compound as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound’s usefulness in some situations the clinical program incorporates adaptive design methodology to use accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of the ongoing clinical study as it continues without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial one type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive phase 2a  2b trial design a twostage trial design consisting of a phase 2a proofofconcept stage and a phase 2b doseoptimization finding stage 

table of conten ts 

if data from the phase 2 trials are satisfactory organon commences largescale phase 3 trials to confirm the compound’s efficacy and safety another type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive phase 2  3 trial design a study that can include an interim analysis and an adaptation that changes the trial from having features common in a phase 2 study such as multiple dose groups to a design similar to a phase 3 trial an adaptive phase 2  3 trial design can reduce timelines by eliminating activities which would be required to start a separate study upon completion of phase 3 trials if satisfactory organon submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing there can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed after a product receives marketing authorization the fda may require organon to perform postmarketing studies or phase 4 studies which may involve additional clinical trials nonclinical testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products or to provide additional information regarding treatment or a drug’s risks benefits or best use 

in the united states upon completion of clinical testing a complete nda or bla is submitted to the fda within 60 days after receipt the fda determines if the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review or instead if the fda will issue a refuse to file determination the fda also assesses at that time whether the application will be granted a priority review or standard review pursuant to the prescription drug user fee act the fda review period target for ndas or original blas is either six months for priority review or 10 months for a standard review from the time the application is deemed sufficiently complete an additional two months is added to these timelines for new molecular entities once the review timelines are determined the fda will generally act upon the application within those timelines unless a major amendment has been submitted either at organons own initiative or the fda’s request to the pending application if this occurs the fda may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information but by no more than three months these timelines are not binding and the fda may not meet them in particular cases the fda can act on an application either by issuing an approval letter or by issuing a complete response letter crl stating that the application will not be approved in its present form and describing all deficiencies that the fda has identified should organon wish to pursue an application after receiving a crl absent an appeal organon is able to resubmit the application with information that addresses the questions or issues identified by the fda to support approval resubmissions are subject to review period targets which vary depending on the underlying submission type and the content of the resubmission 

the fda has four primary program designations—fast track breakthrough therapy accelerated approval and priority review—to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of serious or lifethreatening conditions the fast track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with fda reviewers during the product’s development and the ability for the manufacturer to do a rolling submission of the ndabla a rolling submission allows completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the fda on an ongoing basis the breakthrough therapy designation provides manufacturers with the same features of the fast track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the fda to involve senior managers and experienced staff in the review the accelerated approval designation allows the fda to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product’s clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer to conduct required postapproval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit as a condition of approval the fda will require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform phase 4 or postmarketing studies to verify and describe the predicted clinical benefit and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures the priority review designation means that the fda’s goal is to take action on the ndabla within six months compared to 10 months under standard review with two months added to these periods for new molecular entities 

in addition the biologics price competition and innovation act provides for an abbreviated pathway for obtaining fda approval of biologic drugs that satisfy certain criteria if a manufacturer can show that its proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from the fdaapproved reference product it can rely in part on the fda’s previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for obtaining approval this can potentially lead to a faster and less costly approval process for these products because it generally means that the biosimilar manufacturer does not need to conduct as many clinical trials 

after the nda or bla has been approved a drug can be marketed in the united states and remains subject to postmarketing drug safety monitoring requirements any significant changes to an approved drug such as changes in formulation labeling dosage strength or certain manufacturing changes require approval by the fda through a supplemental application and for certain significant categories of changes prior approval by the fda additionally further development of an approved drug for a new use dosage strength or a new or different form must be conducted under a new ind organons activities after approval are subject to the fda’s requirements governing among other things drug establishment registration and listing labeling and advertising and current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations which set forth minimum requirements for the methods facilities and controls used in manufacturing processing and packing of a drug product postapproval reports of product quality defects and adverse events are maintained and submitted to the fda in accordance with its 

table of conten ts 

regulations the fda conducts routine inspections of drug manufacturing facilities to monitor compliance with these requirements noncompliance with cgmp or other regulatory requirements can lead to regulatory action including issuance of warning letters to organon or issuance of safety alerts press releases or other communications containing warnings about the products suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations suspension of any ongoing clinical trials or other enforcement or regulatory actions including seeking injunction or imposing civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines 

the fda regulates the advertising and promotion of organons products to ensure that the claims organon makes are consistent with its regulatory approvals that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims and that organons promotional labeling and advertising are neither false nor misleading in any respect 

as a manufacturer and distributor of drug products organons activities are regulated under various federal and state statutes including the drug quality and security act of 2013 the dqsa and state manufacturer and wholesaler laws 

title ii of the dqsa known as the drug supply chain security act calls for the establishment of a nationwide electronic system that tracks certain prescription drugs at each point in the supply chain to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled drugs into the market implementation began in 2015 and is scheduled to be completed by 2023 the fda has issued regulations and guidance implementing the dqsa which require manufacturers distributors and dispensers to comply with various regulatory requirements related to product identification product tracing product verification detection and response notification and wholesaler licensing 

under the controlled substances act the csa manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances must maintain registration with the drug enforcement agency dea and comply with various regulatory requirements including maintaining records and inventory reporting to the dea and meeting certain security and operational safeguards similar requirements exist in most states 

medical devices 

the fdas laws and regulations that govern medical devices include requirements for the design development testing manufacturing labeling clinical trials and premarket clearance and approval among other requirements medical devices are classified into three classes based on their risk class i devices present the least risk class ii devices present moderate risk and class iii devices are the highest risk the regulatory controls and requirements vary by the class of device all classes of devices are subject to general controls which include establishment registration and device listing compliance with the design controls and good manufacturing practice requirements of the quality system regulation medical device reporting reporting of recalls corrections and removals and labeling and promotional requirements most class i devices do not require any review by the fda prior to marketing most class ii devices require the submission of a premarket notification under section 510k of the fdca prior to marketing class ii devices are also subject to special controls which are unique controls the fda establishes for each device type typically in the form of a guidance document that specifies requirements such as performance testing and labeling class iii devices require fda approval of a premarket approval application pma prior to marketing and are subject to conditions of approval which may include postmarket study requirements or restrictions on the sale and distribution of the device devices that have not previously been classified are automatically class iii however if the device is low or moderaterisk the manufacturer can submit a de novo classification request asking the fda to classify the device into class i or class ii and authorize the marketing of the device 

a 510k premarket notification must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device already on the market substantial equivalence means that the proposed device 1 has the same intended use as the predicate device and 2 either a has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or b has different technological characteristics but does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device and data demonstrate the proposed device is as safe and effective as the predicate device if the fda agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market it will grant 510k clearance to commercially market the device if the fda determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or if the fda has not classified the device the device is automatically a class iii device the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pma requirements or can request a classification into class i or ii via a de novo classification request a de novo classification request must describe the risks and benefits of the device and demonstrate that general controls for a class i device or general and special controls for a class ii device provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness in a pma the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective and the pma must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trial manufacturing and labeling data 

clinical trials are almost always required to support pmas and are sometimes required to support 510k premarket notifications such clinical testing must be conducted in compliance with the fdas investigational device exemption ide regulations and additional regulations pertaining to human research if the device is a significant risk device clinical trial sponsors must obtain the fdas approval of an ide application prior to commencing the study ide approval is not required for 

table of conten ts 

nonsignificant risk device studies all device clinical trials are subject to additional requirements including obtaining informed consent from study subjects and approval by institutional review boards monitoring recordkeeping reporting and submitting information regarding certain clinical trials to a public database maintained by the national institutes of health 

once a device has obtained fda clearance or approval certain modifications will require further premarket review before they can be implemented for 510kcleared devices or class ii devices authorized through the de novo classification pathway any change that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that involves a major change to the device’s intended use requires clearance of a new 510k premarket notification manufacturers are responsible for determining whether a modification meets this standard and for any changes the company determines do not require a 510k the rationale and information supporting the determination must be documented for pma approved devices major changes ie those affecting safety or effectiveness require fda approval of a pma supplement certain other changes including some labelling changes and some manufacturing changes may be implemented with prior notice to the fda other changes may be reported in periodic reports 

marketed devices are also subject to ongoing fda regulation requirements include those related to establishment registration and device listing labeling and advertising unique device identification and good manufacturing practice and design controls device manufacturers are also subject to the fda’s medical device reporting regulations which require a manufacturer to report to the fda if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur and the fda’s correction and removal reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda corrections or removals undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the fdca that may present a risk to health the fda conducts routine inspections of device manufacturing facilities to monitor compliance with these requirements noncompliance can lead to informal or formal enforcement action including untitled letterswarning letters fines injunctions consent decrees civil penalties recalls detention or seizure of organons products import refusals and criminal prosecution 

although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the fda organon may not promote its products for such offlabel uses and can only market its products for cleared or approved uses both the fda and the federal trade commission have authority over aspects of medical device promotion and prohibit false or misleading labeling and advertising other federal state or foreign enforcement authorities can also take action under other laws and regulations such as false claims laws if they consider organons business activities to constitute promotion of an offlabel use which could result in significant penalties including but not limited to criminal civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement and exclusion from participation in government health care programs 

the regulatory approval process outside the united states 

before organons pharmaceutical products can be marketed outside the united states they may be subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the united states the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials including requirements to conduct additional clinical trials product licensing safety reporting postauthorization requirements marketing and promotion interactions with health care professionals pricing and reimbursement may vary widely from country to country no action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate approval application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country the current approval process varies from country to country and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for fda approval in certain countries the sales price of a product must also be approved the pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product which would make launch of such products commercially unfeasible in such countries there are also regulations setting out requirements for medical devices in jurisdictions outside the united states these regulations set out requirements for placing devices on the market investigationstrials safety reporting marketing and promotion 

the european union 

the following section sets out an overview of the regulatory framework for medicinal products and medical devices in the eu these rules also apply in the additional member states of the european economic area eea namely iceland norway and liechtenstein 

drug and biologic development process 

like the united states the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the eu are subject to significant regulatory controls although the eu clinical trials directive 200120ec clinical trials directive sought to harmonize the eu clinical trials regulatory framework by setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the 

table of conten ts 

eu eu member states have transposed and applied the provisions of the clinical trials directive in a manner that is not always uniform this has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual eu member states therefore the eu has adopted regulation eu no 5362014 clinical trials regulation the clinical trials regulation will subject to certain transition periods that allow some clinical trials to continue to be governed under the clinical trials directive repeal and replace the clinical trials directive as of january 31 2022 

under the clinical trials directive before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each eu member state where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted by two separate entities the national competent authority nca and one or more ethics committees the nca of the eu member states in which the clinical trial will be conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial and the independent ethics committee must grant a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the clinical trial in the relevant eu member state before the commencement of the trial any substantial changes to the trial protocol or to other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be submitted to or approved by the relevant nca and ethics committees under the clinical trials directive all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the nca and to the ethics committees of the eu member state where they occur 

however under the new clinical trials regulation the approval of clinical trials in the eu will be simplified and streamlined for example the sponsor will submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the clinical trials information system as part of the application process the sponsor will propose a reporting eu member state which will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application the reporting eu member state shall consult and coordinate with the other concerned eu member states if an application is rejected it can be amended and resubmitted through the eu portal if an approval is issued the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned eu member states however a concerned eu member state can in limited circumstances declare an optout from an approval in such a case the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that eu member state the clinical trials regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the eu database 

national laws regulations and the applicable good clinical practice and good laboratory practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials including the international council for harmonization of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use guidelines on good clinical practice gcp 

during the development of a pharmaceutical product the ema and national regulators within the eu provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program at the ema level this is usually done in the form of scientific advice which is given by the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp on the recommendation of the scientific advice working party a fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure advice from the ema is typically provided based on questions concerning for example quality chemistry manufacturing and controls testing nonclinical testing and clinical studies and pharmacovigilance plans and riskmanagement programs advice is not legally binding for any future marketing authorization application maa of the product concerned in the eu the pediatric regulation ec no 19012006 pediatric regulation sets out the requirements for testing medicinal products in pediatric populations in most eu member states companies are also required to have an approved pediatric investigation plan before enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial 

drug and biologic marketing authorization procedures 

in the eu pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization ma mas can be obtained through the centralized procedure the mutual recognition procedure the decentralized procedure or a national procedure the latter is available only for pharmaceutical products sold in a single eu member state only the primary method organon uses to obtain a ma of pharmaceutical products in the eu is through the centralized procedure 

the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single ma by the european commission ec which is valid for all eu member states and after respective national implementing decisions in the three additional eea member states the centralized procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products including pharmaceutical products derived from biotechnological processes orphan pharmaceutical products advanced therapy pharmaceutical products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of aids cancer neurodegenerative disorders diabetes autoimmune and viral diseases 

under the centralized procedure the timeframe for the evaluation of an maa by the ema’s chmp is in principle 210 days from receipt of a valid maa however this timeline excludes clock stops which occur when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the chmp so the overall process typically takes a year or more applications may be eligible for accelerated assessment if the chmp decides the product is of major 

table of conten ts 

interest for public health and therapeutic innovation on request the chmp can reduce the time frame to 150 days if the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment the chmp will provide a positive opinion regarding the application only if it meets certain quality safety and efficacy requirements however the ec has final authority for granting the ma and it must issue the decision within 67 days after receipt of the chmp opinion 

following the uks exit from the eu on january 1 2021 the uk medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra converted centralized mas into uk mas that apply in great britain as under the northern irish protocol the eu centralized mas continue to apply in northern ireland ma holders of the centralized mas had the right to optout of the conversion until january 21 2021 however this would mean that these products would not be licensed to be marketed in great britain for those with converted mas the holder of these mas had to submit baseline data to the mhra and pay the national ma fee for eu mas that were granted after january 1 2021 these mas will not be automatically converted into uk mas however the mhra offer some streamlined routes for authorization for example for two years from january 1 2021 the mhra may rely on the decision of the ec on the approval of a new centralized ma when granted an ma that applies in great britain 

if the centralized procedure is not used then applicants can obtain national marketing authorizations this can be if a pharmaceutical product falls under the optional scope of the centralized procedure and the applicant opts to use a national decentralized  mutual recognition procedure or if the centralized procedure would not apply the purely national marketing authorization procedure permits a company to apply to the competent authority of a single eu member state and if successful to obtain a ma that is valid only in this eu member state however if the applicant wants a ma in several eu member states it must use the decentralized or mutual recognition procedure as applicable to obtain a suite of national mas 

the decentralized marketing authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for an ma to the competent authorities in several eu member states simultaneously for a pharmaceutical product that has not yet been authorized in any eu member state this procedure is available for pharmaceutical products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure the competent authority of a single eu member state the reference eu member state is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report the competent authorities of the other eu member states the concerned eu member states are subsequently required to grant ma for their territories based on this assessment the only exception to this is where the competent authority of an eu member state considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product in these circumstances the matter is submitted to the coordination group for mutual recognition and decentralized procedures  human for review 

where a pharmaceutical product has already been authorized for marketing in an eu member state this national authorization can be recognized in another eu member state through the mutual recognition procedure the eu member state that has already granted a ma is the reference eu member state the holder of the ma then asks the reference eu member state to either prepare or update an assessment report as with the decentralized procedure the assessment report is shared with the concerned eu member states these eu member states must grant the ma unless the exception on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health applies 

similar to accelerated approval regulations in the united states conditional mas can be granted in the eu by the ec in exceptional circumstances a conditional ma can be granted for pharmaceutical products where although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product have not been supplied a number of criteria are fulfilled i the benefit  risk balance of the product is positive ii it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data postauthorization iii an unmet medical need will be fulfilled by the grant of the marketing authorization and iv the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the pharmaceutical product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required a conditional ma must be renewed annually until it is eventually converted into a standard ma when the holder fulfills any obligations imposed and the data supports that the benefits outweigh its risks 

alternatively where the applicant can show it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions because the condition is too rare the state of scientific knowledge andor it would be contrary to medical ethics the ec may grant an ma in exceptional circumstances mas granted under exceptional circumstances will be reviewed annually to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh the risks however they will usually not result in a normal ma as the data to support its granting will never be generated 

all new maas must include a risk management plan rmp describing the risk management system that organon will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product the regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the ma rmps and periodic safety update reports psurs are routinely available to third parties requesting access subject to limited redactions 

table of conten ts 

normal mas ie  not including conditional mas and those granted under exceptional circumstances have an initial duration of five years after these five years the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the riskbenefit balance once renewed the ma is valid for an unlimited period unless the ec or the national competent authority decides on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance to proceed with one additional fiveyear renewal applications for renewal must be made to the ema at least nine months before the fiveyear period expires 

data and market exclusivity for drugs and biologics 

as in the united states it may be possible to obtain a period of market and  or data exclusivity in the eu that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic hybrid or biosimilar product in the case of marketing exclusivity even if the pharmaceutical product has already received an ma and for data exclusivity prohibiting another applicant from relying on the ma holder’s pharmacological toxicological and clinical data in support of another ma for the purposes of submitting an application new medicinal products authorized in the eu on the basis of a standalone application ie  on the basis of a dossier containing a complete suite of preclinical tests and clinical trials qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity an additional noncumulative oneyear period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period the first eight years of the 10year marketing exclusivity period the ma holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies this product is referred to as the reference medicinal product 

the data exclusivity period begins on the date of the reference medicinal products first ma in the eu after eight years a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the data in the reference medicinal product’s dossier however a generic product cannot launch until two or three if the reference medicinal product was authorized for an additional indication years later or a total of 10 or 11 years after the first ma in the eu of the reference medicinal product 

another noncumulative oneyear period of data exclusivity can be obtained where an application is made for a new indication for a wellestablished substance provided that significant preclinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication one year of data exclusivity is also available for data generated where a change of classification ie  from prescriptiononly to over the counter of a pharmaceutical product has been authorized on the basis of significant pretrial tests or clinical trials however this data exclusivity only protects the new switch data ie  when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of market authorization for a change of classification of the same substance a competent authority will not refer to the results of those tests or trials for one year 

however data and market exclusivity are not monopoly rights therefore another company could also market another version of the pharmaceutical product if such company can complete a full maa with their own complete database of pharmaceutical tests preclinical studies and clinical trials without relying on the other initial applicant’s data and obtain ma of its product 

postapproval regulation of drugs and biologics 

similar to the united states both ma holders and manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the ema the ec and  or the national competent authorities of the eu member states this oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing licenses and marketing authorizations it includes control of compliance with eu good manufacturing practices rules manufacturing authorizations pharmacovigilance rules and requirements governing advertising promotion sale distribution recordkeeping importing and exporting of pharmaceutical products 

failure by organon or by any of its thirdparty partners including suppliers manufacturers and distributors to comply with eu laws and the related national laws of individual eu member states governing the conduct of clinical trials manufacturing approval marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products and marketing of such products both before and after grant of marketing authorization statutory health insurance bribery and anticorruption or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative civil or criminal penalties these penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization product withdrawals and recalls product seizures suspension withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization total or partial suspension of production distribution manufacturing or clinical trials operating restrictions injunctions suspension of licenses fines and criminal penalties 

the holder of an eu ma for a pharmaceutical product must also comply with eu pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of pharmaceutical products these pharmacovigilance rules can impose on holders of mas the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed pharmaceutical products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits including the possible requirement to conduct additional 

table of conten ts 

clinical studies or postauthorization safety studies to obtain further information on a medicine’s safety or to measure the effectiveness of riskmanagement measures which may be time consuming expensive and could impact organons profitability ma holders must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system ema reviews psurs for pharmaceutical products authorized through the centralized procedure if the ema has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has varied it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing ma for the product be suspended withdrawn or varied the agency can advise that the ma holder be obliged to conduct postauthorization phase iv safety studies the ema opinion is submitted to the ec for its consideration if the european commission agrees with the opinion it can adopt a decision varying the existing ma failure by the marketing authorization holder to fulfill the obligations in the ec’s decision can undermine the ongoing validity of the ma 

more generally noncompliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation suspension or withdrawal of the ma for the product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures 

the manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products in the eu is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable eu laws regulations and guidance including directive 200183ec directive 200394ec regulation ec no 7262004 and the european commission guidelines for good manufacturing practice gmp organon and its thirdparty manufacturers are also subject to other good manufacturing practices which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes stability testing record keeping and quality standards as defined by the ema the ec the national competent authorities of eu member states and other regulatory authorities companies may be subject to civil criminal or administrative sanctions if they fail to comply with these practices these include suspension of manufacturing authorization in case of noncompliance with the eu or eu member states’ requirements governing the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products 

compliance with eu gmp standards is required when manufacturing pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside the eu with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the eu the manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with gmp before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the eu or for use in a clinical trial manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with gmp similarly the distribution of pharmaceutical products into and within the eu is subject to compliance with the applicable eu laws regulations and guidelines including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the eu member states 

sales and marketing regulation of drugs and biologics 

the advertising and promotion of organons products is also subject to eu laws national laws of individual eu member states and industry selfregulatory codes of conduct concerning promotion of pharmaceutical products interactions with health care providers misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices 

while the laws in individual eu member states might vary somewhat in all eu member states these laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to pharmaceutical products comply with the product’s summary of product characteristics smpc as approved by the competent regulatory authorities the smpc is the document that provides information to health care providers concerning the safe and effective use of the pharmaceutical product it forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the pharmaceutical product promotion of a pharmaceutical product that does not comply with the smpc is considered to constitute offlabel promotion the offlabel promotion of pharmaceutical products is prohibited in the european union the applicable laws at the eu level and in the individual eu member states also prohibit the directtoconsumer advertising of prescriptiononly pharmaceutical products enforcement is done on a national basis in accordance with national rulescodes and is largely on the basis of selfregulation penalties for violations of the rules governing the promotion of pharmaceutical products vary between eu member states but could include public censure administrative measures fines and imprisonment these lawscodes may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of organons products to the general public and may also impose limitations on its promotional activities with health care professionals 

anticorruption legislation 

in the eu interactions between pharmaceutical companies and health care providers are also governed by strict laws regulations industry selfregulation codes of conduct and health care providers codes of professional conduct both at the eu level and in the individual eu member states across the eu the provision of benefits or advantages to health care providers to induce or encourage the prescription recommendation endorsement purchase supply order or use of pharmaceutical products is prohibited in the european union however the provision of benefits or advantages to health care 

table of conten ts 

providers is also governed by the national antibribery laws of the eu member states violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment 

while many eu member states permit companies to make payments to health care providers in some circumstances eg  when they are used as consultants certain eu member states required that such payments must be publicly disclosed moreover agreements with health care providers must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer his  her regulatory professional organization and  or the competent authorities of the individual eu member states these requirements are provided in the national laws industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the individual eu member states failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk public reprimands administrative penalties fines or imprisonment 

medical device regulation 

in the eu medical devices are regulated by the european union medical devices regulation eu 2017745 “mdr” which became applicable on may 26 2021 the mdr and its associated guidance document and harmonize standards and govern among other things device design and development preclinical and clinical or performance testing premarket conformity assessment registration and listing manufacturing labeling storage claims sales and distribution export and import and postmarket surveillance vigilance and market surveillance 

before a device can be placed on the market in the eu compliance with the mdr requirements must be demonstrated to affix the conformité européene mark ce mark to the product to demonstrate compliance with these requirements a conformity assessment procedure is required conducted either by the manufacturer for low risk medical devices only which are known as class i devices or by an organization designated by an eu member state to conduct conformity assessments known as a notified body for higher risk medical devices including class i devices that are sterile andor have a measuring function class iia class iib and class iii devices the notified body issues a certificate of conformity which entitles the manufacturer to affix the ce mark to its devices after having prepared and signed a related eu declaration of conformity 

clinical evidence is required for most medium and high risk devices in some cases a clinical study may be required to support a ce marking application a manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the clinical investigation requirements of the mdr eu member state requirements and current good clinical practices defined in harmonized standards and guidance documents 

after a device is placed on the market it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements for ce marked devices certain modifications to the device or quality system depending on the conformity assessment procedure used must be submitted to and approved by the notified body before placing the modified device on the market 

advertising and promotion of devices is governed by the mdr alongside national laws and guidance and is enforced on a countrybycountry basis by national competent authorities the mdr provides that devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are ce marked national rules and appetites for enforcement may vary 

economic operators including device manufacturers must register their establishments and devices in the european data base on medical devices eudamed database once available device manufacturers are also subject to mdr vigilance requirements which require that a manufacturer report to the relevant competent authorities any serious incident involving devices made available on the market and any field safety corrective action in respect of devices made available on the market or undertaken in a third country in relation to a device made available on the market 

postbrexit the mdr does not apply in the uk apart from northern ireland which under the northern irish protocol is bound by certain eu laws the medical device legislative framework in the uk is set out in the medical devices regulations 2002 the medical devices regulations 2002 replace the ce mark with a ukca marking although eu ce marks will be recognized until june 30 2023 require manufacturers outside the uk to appoint a uk responsible person if they place devices on the great british market and more wideranging device registration requirements 

other markets 

outside the united states the eu the eea and other european jurisdictions organon submits marketing applications to national regulatory authorities examples of such are the nmpa in china the ministry of health labour and welfare in japan health canada agência nacional de vigilância sanitária in brazil korea food and drug administration in south korea and therapeutic goods administration in australia each country has a separate and independent review process and timeline in many markets approval times can be longer as the regulatory authority requires approval in a major market

such as the united states or the eu and issuance of a certificate of pharmaceutical product from that market before initiating their local review process 

climate and environmental matters 

organon believes that climate change could present risks to its business some of the potential effects of climate change to organons business could include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements changes in supply due to regulatory requirements physical risks to organons facilities water limitations and disruptions to organons supply chain some potential risks are integrated into organons business planning including investment in reducing energy water use and greenhouse gas emissions organon does not believe these potential risks are material to its business at this time 

organon does not have knowledge of any compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on organons business expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities are estimated to be approximately 19 million in the aggregate for the years 2022 through 2026 for additional information please see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting estimates” and note 12 contingencies —environmental matters to the financial statements included in this report 

thirdparty agreements 

samsung bioepis development and commercialization agreement 

on february 18 2013 merck entered into a development and commercialization agreement with samsung bioepis as subsequently amended the samsung bioepis agreement all of the rights and obligations of merck under the samsung bioepis agreement were transferred to organon in connection with the spinoff the samsung bioepis agreement grants organon an exclusive license to commercialize the following prespecified biosimilars products with reference products in parenthesis developed by samsung bioepis adalimumab humira²  bevacizumab avastin²  infliximab remicade²  trastuzumab herceptin² and etanercept enbrel²  see business—organons biosimilars products for a description of each product and the geographic areas in which organon has an exclusive license for regulatory and commercialization activities 

under the samsung bioepis agreement samsung bioepis is responsible for preclinical and clinical development process development and manufacturing clinical trials and registration of product candidates organons access rights to each product under the samsung bioepis agreement last for ten years from each such product’s launch date on a marketbymarket basis unless the parties agree to extend the term the agreement expires upon the expiration of the last such tenyear period organon may terminate the agreement with respect to a particular region or product if a product fails to meet certain milestones in such region organon may terminate the agreement upon 60 days written notice to samsung bioepis for a particular presentation of a product in a region if samsung bioepis’s revenue share for such product presentation in such region exceeds a certain contractual threshold organon may also terminate the agreement upon 60 days’ written notice in the event of a third party infringement claim that samsung bioepis decides to litigate despite organons opposition to such litigation 

the agreement may be terminated by either party on 30 days written notice for a particular product or region if the parties fail to agree upon a strategy regarding thirdparty patents within six months following written notice by either party of the existence of such patents the agreement may also be terminated by either party upon written notice if the other party commits a material breach of its obligations by specified actions within its reasonable control and has not cured such breach within 90 calendar days after notice requesting cure of the breach 

the samsung bioepis agreement provides that gross profits are shared equally in all markets except for brazil where gross profits are shared 65 to samsung bioepis and 35 to organon the samsung bioepis agreement also provides for payment of certain milestone license fees associated with prespecified clinical and regulatory milestones to samsung bioepis payment of the supply price for each product to samsung bioepis and an upfront payment to samsung bioepis that was completed by merck at the commencement of the agreement as of december 31 2021 there were 25 million in potential future regulatory milestone payments remaining under the agreement for further information related to the samsung bioepis collaboration see note 4 samsung collaboration to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and the samsung bioepis agreement which is filed as an exhibit to this report

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating organon and deciding to invest in the common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect organon’s results of operations financial condition and the price of the common stock 

summary of risk factors 

the following is a summary of the principal risks that could significantly and negatively affect organons business prospects financial conditions or operating results for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing organons business please see below 

risks related to organons business 

• organon has a limited history of operating as an independent company and its historical financial results included elsewhere in this report are not necessarily representative of what its actual financial position or results of operations would have been as an independent company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results 

• key products generate a significant amount of organons profits and cash flows and any events that adversely affect the markets for organons leading products could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

• organon faces continued pricing pressure with respect to its products 

• organon faces intense competition from competitors products 

• organon has limited inhouse discovery and early research capabilities and will continue to rely on future acquisitions partnerships and collaborations to expand its innovative pipeline and early discovery and research capabilities which may limit its ability to discover or develop new products or expand its existing products into new markets to replace the sales of products that lose patent protection and therefore organon may not be able to maintain its current levels of profitability 

• organon may experience difficulties identifying acquisition opportunities or completing such transactions 

• organon or its partners may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of its product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials which would prevent or delay development regulatory approval or clearance and commercialization of organons product candidates 

• organon may be unable to market its pharmaceutical products or medical devices if it does not obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or marketing authorizations 

• developments following regulatory approval or marketing authorization may adversely affect sales of organons pharmaceutical products or medical devices 

• certain of organons products currently benefit from patent protection and market exclusivity when the patent protection and market exclusivity periods for such products expire a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products is generally experienced expiry of patent protection and market exclusivity for products that contribute significantly to organons sales will adversely affect its business 

• organon depends on its patent rights for the marketing of certain of its products and invalidation or circumvention of organons patent rights would adversely affect its business 

• organon is subject to minimum purchase obligations under certain supply agreements and if organon fails to meet those minimum purchase requirements its financial results may be unfavorably impacted 

• organon has incurred substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

table of conten ts 

• organon is subject to a number of restrictive covenants under its indebtedness including customary operating restrictions and financial covenants which could restrict organons ability to pay dividends or adversely affect its financing options and liquidity position 

risks related to the spinoff 

• as organon builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems organon could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions 

• merck may not satisfy its obligations under various transition agreements that have been or will be executed as part of the spinoff or organon may not have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transition agreements expire 

• potential indemnification liabilities to merck pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could adversely affect organon 

• there could be significant income tax liability if the spinoff or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes 

• contractual restrictions limit organons ability to engage in certain corporate transactions 

risks related to organons common stock 

• the price and trading volume of organons common stock may be volatile and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment in organon 

• organon cannot guarantee the timing amount or payment of any dividends on the common stock 

• certain provisions in organons amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of organon which could decrease the trading price of the common stock 

• certain provisions of agreements that organon entered into with merck may limit organons ability to operate its business 

• organons amended and restated bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by organons stockholders and the united states federal district courts as the exclusive forum for claims under the securities act which could limit organons stockholders ability to obtain what such stockholders believe to be a favorable judicial forum for disputes with organon or its directors officers or employees 

risks related to organons business 

organon has a limited history of operating as an independent company and its historical financial results included elsewhere in this report are not necessarily representative of what its actual financial position or results of operations would have been as an independent company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results 

prior to the spinoff merck performed various corporate functions for organon including information technology services research and development distribution support for operations legal payroll finance tax and accounting general administrative services and other support services organons historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from merck for these and similar functions that may be less than the comparable expenses organon would have incurred had it operated as a separate publicly traded company prior to the spinoff organon shared economies of scope and scale in costs employees vendor relationships and relationships with its partners while organon has entered into transition agreements that govern certain commercial and other relationships between it and merck those arrangements may not capture the benefits to organons business that resulted from being integrated with the other affiliates of merck 

key products generate a significant amount of organons profits and cash flows and any events that adversely affect the markets for organons leading products could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

organons ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of its key products such as nexplanon  cozaar®  hyzaar®  singulair® and the ezetimibe family of products as a result of 

table of conten ts 

organons dependence on key products any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products could adversely affect organons sales results of operations or cash flows these adverse events could include increased costs associated with manufacturing product shortages increased generic or overthecounter availability of organons products or competitive products the discovery of previously unknown side effects results of postapproval trials increased competition from the introduction of new more effective treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of these products for any reason organon also expects that competition will continue to adversely affect the sales of these products 

organon faces continued pricing pressure with respect to its products 

organon faces continued pricing pressure globally and particularly in mature markets from managed care organizations government agencies and programs that could adversely affect its sales and profit margins organon expects pricing pressure to continue in the future for example in the united states organon experiences significant pricing pressure from managed care groups institutional and governmental purchasers us federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the aca and state activities aimed at regulating prices and increasing price transparency changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the united states as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in further pricing pressures in addition in the united states larger customers have received higher rebates on drugs in certain highly competitive categories organon must also compete to be placed on formularies of managed care organizations and other payors exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the population covered by the managed care organization or other payor outside the united states numerous major markets including the eu the uk china and japan have pervasive government involvement in health care funding and in that regard extensive pricing and reimbursement mechanisms and processes for pharmaceutical products consequently in those markets organon is subject to government decisionmaking and budgetary actions with respect to its products in china pricing pressure from the chinese government has increased including through a series of health care reforms to accelerate generic substitution while pricing pressure has always existed in china health care reforms have increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through the government’s volumebased procurement vbp and generic quality consistency evaluation gqce programs in japan the pharmaceutical industry is subject to governmentmandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products furthermore the government can order repricing for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable repricing rules 

organon faces intense competition from competitors products 

organons products face intense competition from competitors products including lower cost generic versions of its products that have lost market exclusivity competitors products may be equally safe and as effective as organons products but sold at a substantially lower price than organons products alternatively organons competitors products may be safer or more effective more convenient to use have better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels or be more effectively marketed and sold than organons products organons efforts to compete with other companies or organons failure to maintain its competitive position could adversely affect its business cash flow results of operations financial condition or prospects 

organon has limited inhouse discovery and early research capabilities and will continue to rely on future acquisitions partnerships and collaborations to expand its innovative pipeline and early discovery and research capabilities which may limit its ability to discover or develop new products or expand its existing products into new markets to replace the sales of products that lose patent protection and therefore organon may not be able to maintain its current levels of profitability 

organon has limited inhouse discovery and early research staff and facilities and does not currently intend to extensively hire or acquire such staff or facilities in the near future instead organon intends to continue to rely on future acquisitions partnerships and collaborations with third parties to expand its innovative pipeline existing portfolio and innovation and early research capabilities organon intends to grow its business through new indications or formulations of its existing products or expansion of existing products into new markets or new geographies however organon expects that its ability to do so could be limited by the scope of its limited intellectual property licenses for certain womens health products for example a license from merck for nexplanon permits use of the underlying technology solely as a contraceptive implant containing only the active pharmaceutical ingredient currently used in the product additionally in december 2021 organon signed a supplemental license with merck that provides a limited expansion of the fields in which organon may use the underlying technology of nexplanon beyond contraception in exchange for milestone payments organon may not be able to offset any sales losses for products that lose or do not have exclusivity by growing sales in other markets if organon cannot produce sufficient revenues from expansion into new products new indications or formulations of its existing products or expansion of existing products into new markets or new geographies then organon may not be able to maintain its current levels of profitability and this could adversely affect organons business cash flow results of operations financial condition or prospects 

table of conten ts 

organon may experience difficulties identifying acquisition opportunities or completing such transactions 

organon intends to continue pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships to expand its product offerings and geographic presence as part of its business strategy organon may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and organon may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition license arrangement or strategic partnerships such opportunities may relate to products technologies or operations with which organon has limited or no historical experience for example organon has not historically engaged in the medical device business but in june 2021 organon completed the acquisition of alydia health a commercialstage medical device company in identifying evaluating and selecting acquisition targets organon may encounter intense competition from other companies having a business objective similar to organons many of these companies are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting these types of strategic acquisitions moreover some of these competitors may possess greater financial technical human and other resources than organon does in addition certain provisions of the tax matters agreement which are intended to preserve the intended tax treatment of the spinoff and certain related transactions may discourage delay or prevent acquisition proposals or otherwise limit organons ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions including mergers or consolidations for a period of time following the spinoff even if organon is successful in making acquisitions the products and technologies organon acquires may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than it originally anticipated organon could experience negative effects on its results of operations and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges organon could experience difficulties in integrating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and personnel with diverse backgrounds if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with organons existing business its business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

organon may be unable to market its pharmaceutical products or medical devices if it does not obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or marketing authorizations 

organons activities including the manufacturing and marketing of its pharmaceutical products and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal and state governmental authorities in the united states including the food and drug administration fda and by foreign regulatory authorities including in the eu the uk china and japan in the united states the fda administers requirements covering the laboratory testing clinical trials approval safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals and medical devices regulation of organons pharmaceutical products outside the united states also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and in many cases reduction in the cost of drugs in addition regulatory authorities such as the fda the ema the mhra chinas national medical products administration nmpa and japan’s ministry of health labour and welfare have increased their focus on safety when assessing the benefitrisk balance of drugs these regulatory authorities including in china and japan also have substantial discretion to require additional testing to delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and to otherwise preclude distribution and sale of a product organon currently markets one product in the united states regulated as a medical device the jada system acquired through organons acquisition of alydia health as described elsewhere in this report in the future organon also plans to sell its medical devices in additional major international markets and will be subject to the regulatory requirements imposed in those jurisdictions for example in order to sell medical devices in eu member countries organon will need to comply with the mdr foreign sales outside the eu including in the uk are subject to the foreign government regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and organon will need to obtain marketing authorization by the appropriate regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing activities in those countries 

organon cannot market its pharmaceutical products or medical devices or new indications or modifications to its existing products unless and until organon has obtained all required regulatory approvals or marketing authorizations in each relevant jurisdiction organons applications or submissions for regulatory approval or marketing authorization may be rejected or otherwise delayed by the fda or other foreign regulatory authorities for example the fda may issue complete response letters indicating that organons applications for its pharmaceutical products are not ready for approval once obtained organon must maintain approval or marketing authorization as long as it plans to market products in each jurisdiction where approval or marketing authorization is required the fda or other regulators may change their policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay regulatory approval or marketing authorization of organons future products or impact organons ability to modify its currently marketed products on a timely basis organons failure to obtain approval significant delays in the approval or marketing authorization process or its failure to maintain approval or marketing authorization in any jurisdiction will prevent organon from selling the products in that jurisdiction organon would not be able to realize revenues for its pharmaceutical products or medical devices in any jurisdiction where it does not have approval or marketing authorization

organon or its partners may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of organons pharmaceutical product candidates or medical devices in preclinical studies and clinical trials which would prevent or delay development regulatory approval or marketing authorization and commercialization of organon ’ s product candidates 

before obtaining regulatory approval from the fda or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for the sale of organons pharmaceutical product candidates organon must demonstrate through lengthy preclinical studies and clinical trials that its product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication obtaining marketing authorization for organons devices may also require preclinical and clinical trials preclinical and clinical trials are difficult to design and implement and can take many years to complete and their ultimate outcome is uncertain failure can occur at any time during the preclinical study and clinical trial processes accordingly there is a high risk of failure and organon may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval or marketing authorization of its product candidates 

organon may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of clinical trials that could delay or prevent receipt of regulatory approval or marketing authorization or organons ability to commercialize its product candidates including for example inability to recruit and enroll study subjects failure of its product candidates in preclinical studies or clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy receipt of feedback from the fda and other regulatory authorities that require organon to modify the design of its clinical trials and negative or inconclusive clinical trial results that may require organon to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon certain research andor development programs 

organon may be required to conduct additional preclinical studies clinical trials or other testing of its product candidates beyond those that it currently contemplates or organon may be unable to successfully complete preclinical studies or clinical trials of its product candidates or other testing in a timely manner if the results of these studies trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns organon may incur unplanned costs as well as delays in its efforts to obtain regulatory approval or marketing authorization even if organon receives such approval it may be more limited or restrictive than anticipated or be subject to additional postmarketing testing requirements 

developments following regulatory approval or marketing authorization may adversely affect sales of organons pharmaceutical products or medical devices 

even after a pharmaceutical product or medical device reaches the market organon continues to be subject to significant postmarketing regulatory requirements and oversight the regulatory approvals or marketing authorizations that organon may receive for its pharmaceutical products and medical devices will require the submission of reports to regulatory authorities and ongoing surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of its products may contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified groups warnings precautions or contraindications and may include burdensome postapproval study or risk management requirements in addition even after a pharmaceutical product or device has obtained marketing authorization the manufacturing processes labeling packaging distribution adverse event and device malfunction reporting storage advertising promotion import export recalls and recordkeeping for organons products will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements and organon will be subject to periodic inspections failure to comply with any of these requirements could subject organon to a variety of formal or informal enforcement actions by the fda or other regulators result in a recall or market withdrawal of organons products require organon to cease manufacturing and distribution of the products trigger product liability or other litigation or otherwise impact organons ability to realize revenues for its products 

likewise if previously unknown side effects adverse events malfunctions or other quality or safety concerns are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of organons products it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require it to take actions that could negatively affect sales including initiating corrections of a marketed product or removing the product from the market restricting organons distribution or applying for marketing authorization for labeling changes the fda could also require organon to conduct postmarketing studies of its products further organon is at risk for product liability and consumer protection claims and civil and criminal governmental actions related to its products research and marketing activities in addition dissemination of promotional materials through evolving digital channels serves to increase visibility and scrutiny in the marketplace 

certain developments may decrease demand for organons products including the following 

• scrutiny of advertising and promotion 

• negative results in postapproval phase 4 trials or other studies 

• review by regulatory authorities or other expert bodies of organons products that are already marketed based on new data or other developments in the field 

• the recall loss or modification of regulatory approval or marketing authorization of products that are already marketed and

• changing government regulations regarding safety efficacy quality or labeling 

certain of organons products currently benefit from patent protection and market exclusivity when the patent protection and market exclusivity periods for such products expire a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products is generally experienced expiry of patent protection and market exclusivity for products that contribute significantly to organons sales will adversely affect its business 

organon depends upon patents to provide it with exclusive marketing rights for certain of its products for some period of time loss of patent protection typically leads to a significant and rapid loss of sales for that product where lower priced generic versions of that drug become available in the case of current or future products that contribute significantly to organons sales a loss of market exclusivity could materially adversely affect its business cash flow results of operations financial condition or prospects for example the patent that provided united states market exclusivity for nuvaring expired in april 2018 and generic competition began in december 2019 organon experienced a rapid and substantial decline in nuvaring sales in the united states in 2020 as a result of this generic competition organon expects market exclusivity for nexplanon in the united states to expire in 2027 and market exclusivity for the majority of countries where nexplanon is commercialized outside the united states will expire in 2025 see business—products for details including the patent protection for certain of organons marketed products 

organon depends on its patent rights for the marketing of certain of its products and invalidation or circumvention of organons patent rights would adversely affect its business 

patent protections are important to the marketing of certain of organons products particularly certain of its womens health products in the united states and in most major foreign markets patents covering products that organon has introduced normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the successful marketing and sale of certain of its products 

even if organon succeeds in obtaining patents covering its products third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent organons patents and patent applications it is important for organons business to defend successfully the patent rights that provide market exclusivity for its products organon is involved in patent disputes relating to challenges to its patents or claims by third parties of infringement against it organon defends its patents both within and outside the united states including by filing claims of infringement against other parties in particular manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products from time to time file abbreviated new drug applications with the fda seeking to market generic forms of organons products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by it patent litigation and other challenges to organons patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive it of market exclusivity for a patented product or in some cases thirdparty patents may prevent organon from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area negatively affecting its business and results of operations 

additionally certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and negatively affect organons business and results of operations further court decisions relating to other companies’ patents potential legislation in both the united states and certain foreign markets relating to patents as well as regulatory initiatives may result in a more general weakening of intellectual property protection 

if one or more of organons important products lose patent protection in profitable markets sales of those products are likely to decline significantly as a result of generic versions of those products becoming available organons results of operations may be adversely affected by the lost sales unless and until it has launched commercially successful products that replace the lost sales in addition if products with intangible assets that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negatively affect product cash flows organon may recognize material noncash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products 

organon is subject to minimum purchase obligations under certain supply agreements and if organon fails to meet those minimum purchase requirements its financial results may be unfavorably impacted 

organon is subject to minimum purchase obligations under certain supply agreements which requires organon to purchase minimum amounts of materials critical to its product manufacturing over specified time periods if organon fails to meet these minimum purchase requirements it may still be required to pay for the cost of the minimum inventory purchases if organon is unable to offset these payments it could result in a lower margin during the year ended december 31 2021 organon recognized 24 million in cost of sales pertaining to estimated unavoidable losses associated with a longterm vendor supply contract conveyed as part of the spinoff organon is also aware of a limited number of other arrangements that have similar provisions which could result in these types of payments organon does not currently expect these payments to be material however in the aggregate they may become material if additional amounts are identified in the future and they could have a material adverse effect on organons financial condition results of operations or cash flows

the health care industry in the united states has been and will continue to be subject to increasing regulation and political action 

organon believes that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation and political and legal action at both the federal and state levels 

in 2010 the united states enacted major health care reform legislation in the form of the patient protection and the aca since enactment of that law various insurance market reforms have advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014 the aca also increased the mandated medicaid rebate applicable to most branded drugs from 151 to 231 of the products average manufacturer price expanded the rebate to medicaid managed care utilization and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340b drug discount program 

the aca also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 70 of the cost of the medicine including biosimilar products when medicare part d beneficiaries are in the medicare part d coverage gap ie the socalled donut hole also pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay an annual nontax deductible health care reform fee the fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs such as medicare and medicaid 

as discussed in business—competition and the health care environment there is significant uncertainty about the future of attempts to legislate health care reforms in the united states for example efforts to repeal modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca some of which have been successful create considerable uncertainties for organons business and other pharmaceutical manufacturers there also has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the us with respect to drug pricing practices there have been for example several recent us congressional inquiries hearings and proposed and enacted federal legislation and rules as well as executive orders designed to among other things reduce or limit the price of drugs congress also is currently considering a number of bills relating to drug pricing including the build back better act passed by the us house of representatives in november 2021 which if signed into law could among other things impose government negotiation of prices for medicare part d drugs as well as inflationbased rebates for medicare part b and part d drugs because organon cannot be certain of what provisions ultimately would be enacted into law organon also cannot predict how these or future federal legislative proposals will affect it 

in 2016 the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms issued the medicaid rebate final rule that implemented provisions of the aca effective april 1 2016 the final rule provided comprehensive guidance on the calculation of average manufacturer price and best price which are two metrics that determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state medicaid programs under this final rule among other provisions that have the effect of increasing medicaid rebate liability cms requires manufacturers to include sales to the us territories in the calculation of amp and best price however that provision has been delayed several times and currently is scheduled to take effect on january 1 2023 on december 31 2020 cms published a final rule on the medicaid program which among other things introduced for the first time a regulatory definition of the terms line extension and new formulation cms defined line extension as a new formulation of the drug but does not include an abusedeterrent formulation of the drug cms adopted an expansive definition of new formulation to include a change to the drug including but not limited to an extended release formulation or other change in release mechanism a change in dosage form strength route of administration or ingredients this expanded definition may result in certain of organons drugs being subject to a higher medicaid rebate liability the new definitions of line extension and new formulation took effect on january 1 2022 finally the provisions of this december 2020 final rule also may affect rebates owed under the medicaid drug rebate program in certain circumstances where accumulator adjustment or similar programs are applied to organons drugs and the value of its assistance programs which is intended for patients is not counted towards the patient’s deductible or other outofpocket costs 

in 2020 the fda issued a final rule implementing provisions of section 804 of the fdca which allows the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from canada through fdaauthorized timelimited programs sponsored by states or indian tribes and in certain future circumstances pharmacists and wholesalers at that time the fda also released final guidance for industry detailing procedures for drug manufacturers to import fdaapproved prescription drug biological and combination products that were manufactured abroad and authorized and intended for sale in a foreign country a trade organization brought suit which remains pending in federal district court challenging the commercial importation final rule these changes could have a material adverse effect on organons business cash flow results of operations financial condition and prospects changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the united states as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in further pricing pressures as an example health care reform has contributed to an increase in the number of patients in the medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates 

various executive and legislative actions in the united states have been proposed or may in the future be proposed to mandate reduced drug prices for example in november 2020 cms issued a final rule that was intended to be effective 

table of conten ts 

january 1 2021 which would have instituted a new pricing system for certain prescription drugs and biologic products covered by medicare part b whereby medicare would reimburse no more than the most favored nation price the rule was immediately challenged in at least four federal courts and has been temporarily enjoined from going into effect the department of health and human services has indicated that the most favored nation or mfn model will not be implemented without further rulemaking 

additionally in november 2020 the department of health and human services office of inspector general oig issued a final rule effective january 1 2022 that eliminates the antikickback statute safe harbor for rebates paid to medicare part d plans or to pharmacy benefit managers on behalf of such plans the effectiveness of this final rule was delayed as part of the infrastructure investment and jobs act which was signed into law on november 15 2021 and requires the secretary of health and human services not to implement administer or enforce the provisions of the final rule prior to january 1 2026 in addition on november 19 2021 the house of representatives passed a version of the build back better act that includes a provision prohibiting the implementation administration or enforcement of the final rule beginning on january 1 2026 as a result it remains to be seen whether and to what extent the provisions of this final rule will take effect while organon cannot anticipate the effects of these changes to the way that it currently contracts the new framework could significantly alter the way it does business with part d plan sponsors and pbms on behalf of such plans 

organon cannot predict the likelihood of additional future changes in the health care industry in general the pharmaceutical industry in particular or what impact they may have on its business cash flow results of operations financial condition or prospects 

organon is subject to a variety of united states other national and international laws and regulations and organon may face serious consequences for violations if it fails to meet the applicable legal and regulatory requirements 

organon is currently subject to a number of government laws and regulations and in the future could become subject to new government laws and regulations the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations or the negative results of noncompliance could adversely affect organons business cash flow results of operations financial condition or prospects the costs of compliance and penalties for noncompliance may be particularly significant with respect to health care reform initiatives in the united states or in other countries including additional mandatory discounts or fees new laws regulations and judicial or other governmental decisions affecting pricing reimbursement and market access or marketing within or across jurisdictions new and increasing data privacy regulations and enforcement particularly in the eu the uk the united states and china legislative mandates or preferences for local manufacturing of medical products emerging and new global regulatory requirements for reporting payments and other value transfers to health care professionals and health care organizations environmental regulations and emerging and new regulations on human rights and environmental matters in the supply chain and importation restrictions embargoes trade sanctions and legislative or other regulatory changes 

organon is also subject to anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the us domestic bribery statute contained in 18 usc § 201 the us travel act the usa patriot act the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act 2010 and other antibribery and corruption laws anticorruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees agents contractors and other thirdparty collaborators from authorizing promising offering providing soliciting or receiving directly or indirectly improper payments or anything else of value to or from persons in the public or private sector the fcpa also requires us public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls 

in addition to selling its products internationally organon currently engages third parties outside the united states and may engage additional third parties outside the united states to sell its products internationally and to obtain necessary permits licenses patent registrations and other regulatory approvals organon has direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or governmentaffiliated hospitals universities and other organizations organon can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its employees agents contractors and other thirdparty collaborators even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties imprisonment the loss of export or import privileges debarment tax reassessments preclusion from participating in public tenders breach of contract and fraud litigation reputational harm and other consequences 

organon has significant global operations which expose it to additional risks and any adverse event could adversely affect organons results of operations and financial condition 

the extent of organons operations outside the united states is significant for example in 2021 organon generated 49 billion in sales outside the united states representing approximately 80 of its total organon products sales risks inherent in conducting a global business include 

• changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing restrictions in key markets 

table of conten ts 

• multiple regulatory requirements that could restrict organons ability to manufacture and sell its products in key markets 

• multiple conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations tax laws tariffs employment laws regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals permits and licenses 

• trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements including the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the united states or other governments 

• financial risks such as foreign exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles difficulty collecting accounts receivable the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for organons products 

• volatility of commodity prices fuel shipping rates that impact the costs andor ability to supply organons products 

• diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries and 

• possible nationalization and expropriation 

in addition there may be changes to organons business and strategic position if there is instability disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including health epidemics or pandemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic riot civil insurrection or social unrest and natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease in addition organons operations and performance may be affected by political or civil unrest or military action as a result of global economic conditions some parties may delay or be unable to satisfy their payment or reimbursement obligations job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients ability to afford health care as a result of increased copay or deductible obligations greater cost sensitivity to existing copay or deductible obligations lost health care insurance coverage or for other reasons further with rising international trade tensions or sanctions organons business may be adversely affected following new or increased tariffs as well as the costs of materials products and commodities upon which organon rely as a result changes in international trade policy changes in trade agreements and the imposition of tariffs or sanctions by the us or other countries could materially adversely affect organons results of operations and financial condition 

in particular in february 2022 the armed conflict between ukraine and russia escalated which may adversely impact organons business specifically trade sanctions travel bans and assetfinancial freezes announced by the united states european union and other countries against russian entities and designated individual restrictions have impacted and may continue to impact many global businesses in direct and indirect ways including but not limited to product shipping delays supply shortages delays in regulatory approvals and audits and currency exchange rates such actions may negatively impact the financial institutions vendors manufacturers suppliers partners and other third parties with whom organon conducts business and therefore may negatively impact organon 

organon is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally many of which place restrictions on organons ability to transfer access and use personal data across its business 

the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve 

the gdpr and related implementing laws in individual eu or european economic area eea member states govern the collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the eu the gdpr increased responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that organon processes it also imposes several obligations and restrictions on the ability to process which includes collection storage and access analysis and transfer of personal data including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting the gdpr also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data potential notification of personal data breaches to the national data protection authorities potential consultation obligations to national data protection authorities for certain highrisk data processing and the security and confidentiality of the personal data there are also new accountability requirements such as maintaining a record of data processing potentially conducting data protection impact assessments and appointing data protection officers further the gdpr prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the eea that are not considered by the european commission to provide an adequate level of data protection including to the united states except if the data controller meets very specific requirements 

failure to comply with the requirements of the gdpr and the related national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed data protection authorities from the different eu member states may still enforce the gdpr differently reflecting variations that arise under nationallevel regulations and guidelines eg labor laws 

table of conten ts 

processing of national identification numbers which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the eu guidance at both eu level and at the national level in individual eu member states concerning implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised resulting in a challenging regulatory environment 

there is moreover a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the eu which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against organon harm to its reputation and adversely impact its business and operating results the uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that organon faces with regard to data protection regulation 

additional laws and regulations enacted in the united states such as the california consumer privacy act europe asia and latin america have increased enforcement and litigation activity in the united states and other developed markets as well as increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally organon has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving risks and facilitate the transfer of personal information across international borders which has been certified as compliant with and approved by the asia pacific economic cooperation crossborder privacy rules system 

organon depends on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure cyberattacks affecting organons it systems could result in exposure of confidential information the modification of critical data or the disruption of its worldwide operations including manufacturing and sales operations 

organon depends on sophisticated software applications complex information technology systems computing infrastructure and cloud service providers collectively it systems to conduct critical operations certain of these systems are managed hosted provided or used by third parties including merck pursuant to a transition services agreement to assist in conducting organons business disruption degradation destruction or manipulation of these it systems through intentional or accidental means by organons employees third parties with authorized access or cyber threat actors could adversely affect key business processes the size and complexity of organons it systems and those of organons thirdparty providers with whom its contracts make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions in addition organon and its thirdparty providers have experienced and expect to continue to experience phishing attempts scanning attempts of organons network and other attempts of unauthorized access to its computer environment such attacks are increasingly sophisticated and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise including state and quasistate actors criminal groups hackers and others these attacks could lead to loss of confidentiality integrity andor availability of organons data applications or systems 

in the ordinary course of business organon and its thirdparty providers collect store and transmit large amounts of confidential information including trade secrets or other intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information and organon must do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information the size and complexity of organon and its thirdparty providers systems and the large amounts of confidential information present on them also makes them potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by organons employees partners or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties maintaining the confidentiality integrity and availability of this confidential information including trade secrets or other intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information is important to organons competitive business position however such information can be difficult to protect and could be compromised 

while organon has taken steps to protect such information and to ensure that the thirdparty providers on which it relies have taken adequate steps to protect such information organons efforts to protect its data and it systems or the efforts of thirdparty providers to protect their it systems may not succeed a breach of organons it systems or its thirdparty providers it systems such as cloudbased systems or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure unapproved dissemination misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets proprietary information or other confidential information whether as a result of theft hacking fraud trickery or other forms of deception or for any other cause could enable others to produce competing products use organons proprietary technology or information andor adversely affect organons business position further any such interruption security breach or loss misappropriation andor unauthorized access use or disclosure of confidential information including personal information regarding organons patients and employees or the modification of critical data could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to organon and could result in loss of revenue or the loss of critical or sensitive information from organons or its thirdparty providers databases or it systems or result in financial legal business or reputational harm to organon and substantial remediation and recovery costs 

organon may experience difficulties delays or expenses in manufacturing certain of its products 

organon or its suppliers and other manufacturing partners may experience difficulties delays or expenses in connection with manufacturing organons products such as failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities delays related to the supply 

table of conten ts 

of key ingredients or other components of organons products increased costs of key materials packaging or operational procedures and other manufacturing or distribution problems including but not limited to changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity resulting from regulatory requirements changes in types of products produced and physical limitations that could impact supply in addition organon could experience difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes and public health crises and epidemicspandemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic manufacturing difficulties delays or shutdowns as well as difficulties obtaining materials of adequate quality and quantity can result in product shortages leading to lost sales a significant short or longterm financial impact government agency actions and reputational harm to organon which are difficult to predict 

the global covid19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact organons business operations financial performance results of operations and financial condition 

organons business and financial results have been negatively impacted by the outbreak of covid19 in 2021 the negative impact of covid19 on organon products sales was estimated to be approximately 400 million a significant amount of organons revenue is comprised of physician prescribed products which despite underlying demand have been affected by reduced access fewer medical visits and delays in elective procedures these impacts as well as the prioritization of covid19 patients at health care providers have resulted in reduced prescription of many products within established brands and womens health in particular nexplanon  throughout 2021 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts organons business going forward will depend on future developments which may include the duration of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or mitigate its impact the economic impacts of the pandemic and its impact on organons customers and suppliers new and emerging variants of the virus present additional uncertainty that could lead to further restrictions that may have a negative impact on organons operations and the larger economy 

even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided organon may experience significant impacts to its business as a result of its global economic impact including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future 

organon may be unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a costeffective price or organon may experience other supply difficulties that could adversely affect both its ability to deliver its products and its results of operations and financial condition 

organon acquires its components materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries including sometimes from itself for selfsupplied requirements organon endeavors to achieve either alone or by working closely with its suppliers continuity of organons inputs and supplies but it cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful for instance follistim and atozet¹ have been challenged by intermittent supply disruptions further while efforts are made to diversify certain of organons sources of components and materials in certain instances there is only a sole source or it would require months or years to establish an alternative supplier for many of organons components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used alternative sources or suppliers may exist but organon has made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier although organon does carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption it cannot assure investors that such measures will always be sufficient or effective further if organon does seek recovery or damages from such supplier for any supply shortages or disruptions such recovery or damages may be limited and not include indirect or consequential losses or any loss of revenue or lost profits organons ability to achieve continuity of its supply may also be affected by public health crises and epidemicspandemics a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect organons ability to manufacture and distribute its products in a timely or costeffective manner negatively impacting organons ability to sell its products 

organon may not realize benefits from its investments in emerging markets 

organon has been taking steps to increase its sales in emerging markets however organons efforts to expand sales in these markets may not succeed some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on health care in order for organon to successfully implement its emerging markets strategy organon must attract and retain qualified personnel organon may also be required to increase organons reliance on thirdparty agents within less developed markets in addition many of these countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and if such currencies devalue and organon cannot offset the devaluations its financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected 

for example organons business in china is growing and china is now organons second largest market thereby increasing the importance of china to organons overall pharmaceutical business continued growth of organons business in china depends upon ongoing development of a favorable regulatory environment sustained availability of organons currently marketed products within china and organons ability to mitigate the impact of any trade impediments or adverse pricing 

table of conten ts 

controls pricing pressure in china has increased as the chinese government has been taking steps to reduce costs including implementing health care reform that has led to the acceleration of generic substitution where available while pricing pressure has always existed in china health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through the governments vbp and gqce programs in 2019 the government implemented the vbp program through a tendering process for products that have generic substitutes with a gqce approval mature products that have entered into the first six rounds of vbp had on average a price reduction of approximately 50 organon expects vbp to be a semiannual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward 

furthermore the chinese government has started its efforts to unify the reimbursement price urp between gqceapproved generic products and the applicable originator products the urp policy will create additional pricing and volume pressure for pharmaceutical products that are subject to the program and may adversely affect organons business and results of operations 

in addition organon currently relies on a thirdparty manufacturer to import repackage and then sell a significant portion of its products in china china’s regulatory landscape continues to evolve including reform of the mah system and change of registration and licensing requirements for imported pharmaceutical products these regulatory changes may limit the ability for the thirdparty manufacturer to continue to sell organons products to downstream distributors the regulatory authority has not made it clear in the existing regulatory framework a pathway for selling these repackaged products to public hospitals if organon fails to identify a pathway forward its business in china may be adversely affected 

in addition organon plans to pivot in china from a primary focus on the public tender market to growth opportunities in the private retail segment a failure to make such pivot effectively or a failure to develop and maintain a presence in emerging markets could adversely affect organons business cash flow results of operations financial condition or prospects 

organon is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 

organon operates in multiple jurisdictions and virtually all of its sales outside the united states are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar additionally organon has historically entered into and will in the future enter into business development transactions borrowings or other financial transactions that may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure since organon cannot with certainty foresee and mitigate against such adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and inflation could negatively affect organons business cash flow results of operations financial condition or prospects 

in order to mitigate the adverse impact of these market fluctuations organon enters into hedging agreements from time to time while hedging agreements such as currency options and forwards and interest rate swaps may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not always successful as a result currency fluctuations among organons reporting currency the us dollar and other currencies in which organon does business will affect its operating results often in unpredictable ways 

reliance on thirdparty relationships and outsourcing arrangements could materially adversely affect organons business 

organon depends on third parties including other suppliers alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and thirdparty service providers for key aspects of organons business including development manufacture and commercialization of its products including supplying its products or key ingredients of its products and support for its it systems in addition in connection with the interim operating arrangements organon has been establishing following the spinoff organon may enter into agreements with thirdparties in certain jurisdictions including china to continue its business operations in compliance with local regulatory requirements failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory and other obligations to organon or the development of factors that materially disrupt the relationships between it and these third parties could adversely affect organons business 

the markets for organons products including the womens health market may not develop as successfully as expected 

organons focus on women’s health is a key component of its strategy organons ability to successfully execute its growth strategy in this area is subject to numerous risks including 

• uncertainty of the development of a market for such products 

• trends relating to or the introduction or existence of competing products technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective safer or easier to use than organons products technologies treatments or therapies 

table of conten ts 

• the perception of organons products as compared to other products 

• recommendation and support for the use of organons products or treatments by influential customers such as obstetricians gynecologists reproductive endocrinologists and treatment centers 

• changes in government policy or regulations could impair or repeal contraception coverage mandates under the aca or state laws which may affect payments to organon or impose additional coverage limitations or costsharing obligations on its patients 

• the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of organons products or treatments 

• competition including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories more recognizable names and more established distribution networks and 

• other technological developments 

if organon is unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for its womens health products organons business or prospects could be harmed 

biosimilars carry unique regulatory risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect organons results of operations and financial condition 

there are unique regulatory risks and uncertainties related to biosimilars the regulation of the testing approval safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling and marketing of biosimilars are subject to regulation by the fda the ema and other regulatory bodies these laws and regulations differ from and are not as wellestablished as those governing pharmaceutical products or the approval of generic pharmaceutical products in addition manufacturing biosimilars especially in large quantities is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living cells and microorganisms any changes to the regulatory framework governing biosimilars or in the ability of organons partners to manufacture an adequate supply of biosimilars may adversely affect organons ability to commercialize the biosimilars in its portfolio 

organon relies on its collaboration with samsung bioepis for the successful development and manufacture of organons biosimilars products and expects to do so for the foreseeable future 

organons current biosimilars portfolio consists entirely of products developed and manufactured by samsung bioepis for which it has worldwide commercialization rights with certain geographic exceptions specified on a productbyproduct basis organons access rights to each product under its agreement with samsung bioepis last for 10 years from each such products launch date on a marketbymarket basis see business—thirdparty agreements—samsung bioepis development and commercialization agreement organons ability to successfully commercialize products in its biosimilars portfolio may depend upon maintaining a successful relationship with samsung bioepis the success of organons commercialization activities may also depend in part on the performance operations and regulatory compliance of samsung bioepis and its suppliers over which organon does not have control organon cannot assure investors that its collaboration will be successful or that it will achieve the benefits of its collaboration 

organon has incurred substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect organons financial condition and results of operations  

at december 31 2021 organon had outstanding indebtedness of approximately 91 billion as described more fully in the notes its financial statements in addition organon may incur additional debt from time to time to finance acquisitions or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents that govern its indebtedness current or future levels of indebtedness may increase the possibility that organon will be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of such indebtedness 

organons ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for organons products if organons customers or suppliers are unable to pay amounts due to organon or there are other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect organons ability to access the capital markets these conditions may adversely affect organons ability to obtain and maintain its credit ratings 

table of conten ts 

organon is subject to a number of restrictive covenants under its indebtedness including customary operating restrictions and financial covenants which could restrict organons ability to pay dividends or adversely affect its financing options and liquidity position 

organons current indebtedness contains and any future indebtedness may contain customary operating restrictions and financial covenants this indebtedness may adversely affect organons ability to operate or grow its business or could have other material adverse consequences including by 

• limiting organons ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions 

• limiting organons ability to refinance its indebtedness on terms acceptable to organon or at all 

• restricting organons operations or development plans 

• requiring organon to dedicate a significant portion of its cash flows from operations to paying amounts due under its indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other corporate purposes 

• impeding organons ability to pay dividends 

• making organon more vulnerable to economic downturns or 

• limiting organons ability to withstand competitive pressures 

any of these restrictions on organons ability to operate its business in its discretion could adversely affect its business by among other things limiting organons ability to adapt to changing economic financial or industry conditions and to take advantage of corporate opportunities including opportunities to obtain debt financing repurchase stock refinance or pay principal on organons outstanding debt dispose of property complete acquisitions for cash or debt or make other investments in addition events beyond organons control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions could affect organons ability to satisfy applicable financial covenants and organon cannot assure you that it will satisfy them 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of organons current indebtedness or any future financing agreements including as a result of events beyond organons control may result in an event of default under these agreements which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these agreements and other agreements giving organons lenders and other debt holders the right to terminate any commitments they may have made to provide organon with further funds and to require organon to repay all amounts then outstanding 

risks related to the spinoff 

as organon builds its information technology infrastructure and transition its data to its own systems organon could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions 

in connection with the spinoff organon installed and implemented information technology infrastructure to support its critical business functions including accounting and reporting manufacturing process control quality and compliance systems customer service inventory control and distribution organon may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if it cannot transition effectively from merck’s existing transactional and operational systems data centers and the transition services that support these functions as organon replaces these systems organon may not be successful in implementing its new systems and transitioning its data and organon may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated organons failure to avoid operational interruptions as it implements the new systems and replace mercks information technology services or organons failure to implement the new systems and replace mercks services successfully could disrupt organons business or adversely affect its results of operations in addition if organon is unable to replicate or transition certain systems organons ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired 

merck may not satisfy its obligations under various transaction agreements that have been or will be executed as part of the spinoff or organon may not have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transition agreements expire 

in connection with the spinoff organon and merck entered into the separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including one or more transition services agreements manufacturing and supply agreements trademark license agreements intellectual property license agreements an employee matters agreement a tax matters 

table of conten ts 

agreement and certain other commercial or operating agreements these agreements are discussed in greater detail in the section entitled certain relationships and related transactions certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the distribution organon may rely on merck to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if merck is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations organon could experience operational difficulties or losses 

if organon does not have its own systems and services in place or if organon does not have agreements with other providers of these services when these agreements terminate organon may not be able to operate its business effectively and its profitability may decline organon is in the process of creating its own or engaging third parties to provide systems and services to replace many of the systems and services merck currently provides to organon organon may not be successful in effectively or efficiently implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from merck’s systems to organons these systems and services may also be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and services merck is expected to provide during the transition period 

potential indemnification liabilities to merck pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could adversely affect organon 

the separation and distribution agreement with merck covers among other things provisions governing the relationship between merck and organon with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make organon financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement including any pending or future legal matters these liabilities which could be material to organon include a general obligation to indemnify merck for litigation or governmental proceedings relating to organons products including but not limited to currently pending litigation relating to fosamax  nexplanon  and propecia  proscar  more specifically organons obligations to indemnify merck may in some cases include liability for antitrust litigation provided however organon will not be liable for the results of the antitrust litigation related to zetia or the product liability litigation in brazil related to vioxx²  for a description of the related legal matters see note 12 contingencies to the financial statements included in this report these indemnification liabilities are intended to ensure that as between merck and organon organon is responsible for all liabilities it assumes in connection with the spinoff and that organon pays for any liability incurred by merck including directors officers employees and agents related to organons failure to satisfy such obligations or otherwise in respect of the operation of its business or any breach by organon of the separation and distribution agreement or any ancillary agreement organons indemnity obligations to merck under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement may be substantial 

there could be significant income tax liability if the spinoff or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes 

prior to completion of the spinoff merck received the tax opinions from its tax advisors that concluded among other things that the distribution of all of the outstanding organon shares to merck stockholders and certain related transactions qualify as taxfree to merck and its stockholders under sections 355 and 368 of the us internal revenue code except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of organon common stock the tax opinions are not binding on the internal revenue service irs accordingly the irs may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the tax opinions the tax opinions rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from merck and organon regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters which if incomplete incorrect or not satisfied could alter the conclusions of the party giving such tax opinion 

if the spinoff is ultimately determined to be taxable the spinoff could be treated as a taxable dividend to merck’s shareholders for us federal income tax purposes and merck’s stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition merck would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of organon common stock exceeds merck’s tax basis in such stock on the date of the spinoff each of merck and organon generally will be responsible for any taxrelated losses imposed on merck or organon as a result of the failure of a transaction to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent that the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to mercks or organons respective stock assets or business or a breach of the relevant covenants made by merck or organon in the tax matters agreement 

contractual restrictions limit organons ability to engage in certain corporate transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to merck of the spinoff the tax matters agreement restricts organon from taking any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being taxfree for us federal income tax purposes in particular under the tax matters agreement for the twoyear period following the distribution organon is prohibited except in certain circumstances from among other things 

table of conten ts 

• entering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of above a certain percentage of organons stock or substantially all of its assets whether by merger or otherwise 

• merging consolidating or liquidating 

• selling or transferring of organons assets beyond certain thresholds 

• issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds 

• repurchasing organons capital stock 

• amending organons organizational documents in certain respects 

• ceasing to actively conduct certain businesses or causing organons applicable affiliates to cease to actively conduct certain of their businesses and 

• taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being taxfree 

these restrictions may limit organons ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that organon may believe to be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of organons business in addition organon is required to indemnify merck against any tax liabilities as a result of such actions even if organon did not participate in or otherwise facilitate such actions in the event the spinoff fails to be taxfree as a result of such actions organons indemnity obligation for merck’s tax liability under the tax matters agreement would be substantial and could materially affect its cash flow 

certain of organons executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous positions at merck 

because of their former positions with merck certain of organons executive officers and directors own shares of merck common stock and continue to participate in certain merck benefit programs even though organons board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent and organons executive officers who were previously employees of merck ceased to be employees of merck in connection with the spinoff some organon executive officers and directors continue to have financial interests in merck continuing ownership of merck common stock and continued participation in merck benefit programs could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest if organon and merck pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for organon and merck 

risks related to organons common stock 

the price and trading volume of organons common stock may be volatile and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment in organon 

the trading volume and market price of organons common stock may be volatile this volatility could negatively impact organons ability to raise additional capital or utilize equity as consideration in any acquisition transactions organon may seek to pursue and could make it more difficult for existing stockholders to sell their shares of the common stock at a price they consider acceptable or at all this volatility is caused by a variety of factors including among the other risks described in this report 

• organons liquidity and ability to obtain additional capital including the markets reaction to any capitalraising transaction organon may pursue 

• declining working capital to fund operations or other signs of financial uncertainty 

• any negative decisions by the fda or comparable regulatory bodies outside the united states regarding organons products and product candidates 

• market assessments of any strategic transaction or collaboration arrangement organon may pursue 

• sales of substantial amounts of organons common stock or the perception that substantial amounts of organons common stock may be sold by stockholders in the public market 

• changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or organons ability to meet those estimates 

table of conten ts 

• issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts or changed recommendations for organons common stock and 

• significant advances made by competitors that adversely affect organons competitive position 

in addition the stock market in general and the market for stock of companies in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of comparable companies in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company this type of litigation if instituted against organon could result in substantial costs and a diversion of its management’s attention and resources 

organon cannot guarantee the timing amount or payment of any dividends on the common stock 

organon currently expects that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of organons board of directors the board of directors decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as organons financial condition earnings corporate strategy capital requirements debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant organons ability to pay any dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets 

certain provisions in organons amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of organon which could decrease the trading price of the common stock 

organon is a delaware corporation and its amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law each contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with organons board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover specifically because organon has not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that stockholders may favor 

section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation may not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or their affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock 

in addition organons amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include additional provisions that may have antitakeover effects and may delay deter or prevent a takeover attempt that organons stockholders might consider in their best interests for example organons amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

• permit organons board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with such powers rights and preferences as the board of directors shall determine 

• subject to a threeyear sunset starting with organons first annual meeting of stockholders provide for a classified board of directors with each class serving a staggered threeyear term which could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult 

• provide that as long as organons board of directors is classified organons directors can be removed for cause only 

• prohibit stockholder action by written consent 

• provide that special meetings of stockholders can be called only by the board of directors 

• provide that vacancies on the board of directors could be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office even if less than a quorum or by a sole remaining director and 

• establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors 

organon believes these provisions will protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with organons board of directors and by providing its board of directors with more 

table of conten ts 

time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make organon immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that organons board of directors determines is not in the best interests of organon and its stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors in addition these limitations may adversely affect the prevailing market price and market for organons common stock if they are viewed as limiting the liquidity of its stock or discouraging takeover attempts in the future 

certain provisions of agreements that organon entered into with merck may limit organons ability to operate its business 

certain of the agreements that organon entered into with merck require mercks consent to any assignment by organon of its rights and obligations under the agreements the consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that stockholders may consider favorable 

organons amended and restated bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by organons stockholders and the united states federal district courts as the exclusive forum for claims under the securities act which could limit organons stockholders ability to obtain what such stockholders believe to be a favorable judicial forum for disputes with organon or its directors officers or employees 

organons amended and restated bylaws provide that unless organon selects or consents to the selection in writing of an alternative forum all internal corporate claims which include claims in the right of organon company i that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director officer employee or stockholder in such capacity or ii as to which the delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction upon the court of chancery will to the fullest extent permitted by law be exclusively brought in the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if such court does not have jurisdiction another state court or a federal court located within the state of delaware 

furthermore unless organon selects or consents to the selection of an alternative forum the federal district courts of the united states of america will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act organons exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder 

these exclusive provisions may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that he she or it believes to be favorable for disputes with organon or its directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits it is possible that a court could find these exclusive forum provisions inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings and organon may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could materially adversely affect organons business financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of its management and board of directors

key trends affecting our results of operations 

• generic competition  the majority of our established brands products are beyond market exclusivity however these products continue to represent a significant value opportunity arising from longterm sustainable revenue streams and wellestablished supply chains that together generate significant operating profit relative to low promotional and development expenses 

• sustained shift towards longacting reversible contraceptives  although daily contraceptive pills remain the largest market segment the longacting reversible contraceptives larc market segment which includes nexplanon ® etonogestrel implant sold as implanon nxt™ in some countries outside the us has experienced significant growth in the years leading up to 2019 due to a sustained shift from daily oral contraception to larc this was driven by payors providers and patients looking for options beyond commonly used daily contraceptive pills the covid19 pandemic negatively affected the larc segment during 2021 and 2020 due to clinic closures and the postponement of nonessential medical procedures during country lockdowns however larc segment growth quickly rebounded during months when clinic restrictions were removed and the sustained shift to larc is expected to continue with fundamental drivers unchanged 

• increased access to fertility solutions  we believe governments and payors are implementing favorable policies across major markets that in turn drive growth in the market for women’s health therapies for example in the united states there has been an increase in fertility insurance mandates and employer coverage albeit subject to certain exemptions 

• emergence of biosimilars  biologics continue to experience strong growth trends however given the high cost of many of these biologics treatments biosimilars are a more affordable alternative and represent a significant opportunity for patients providers and payors once a biologics product loses patent protection moreover a significant number of biologics are expected to lose exclusivity over the next decade representing a large opportunity for more biosimilar approvals 

• increased competitive pressures  the markets in which we conduct our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated our competitors include other worldwide researchbased pharmaceutical companies smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers

covid19 update 

organon remains focused on protecting the safety of its employees and supporting organon’s communities in response to the covid19 pandemic covid19related disruptions including patients’ inability to access health care providers prioritization of covid19 patients as well as social distancing measures have negatively affected our results 

the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic to organon sales was approximately 400 million in each of the years 2021 and 2020 our product portfolio is comprised of physician prescribed products mainly in established brands which have been affected by social distancing measures and fewer medical visits additionally our portfolio in womens health includes products that are physician administered which have been affected by limited access to physicians and healthcare centers these impacts as well as the prioritization of covid19 patients at health care providers resulted in reduced administration of many products within established brands particularly for respiratory and cardiovascular products and womens health product nexplanonimplanon nxt  throughout 2020 and 2021 

we believe that global health systems and patients continue to adapt to the evolving impacts of the covid19 pandemic and although we experienced recoveries during 2021 ongoing negative impacts persisted during most of 2021 principally affecting products within established brands and women’s health primarily nexplanonimplanon nxt  

operating expenses in 2021 were higher compared to 2020 primarily due to lower promotional and selling costs incurred in 2020 attributable to the covid19 pandemic as well as incremental costs associated with establishing organon as a standalone company 

operating results 

sales overview 

us plus international may not equal total due to rounding  

worldwide sales were 63 billion in 2021 a decrease of 3 compared with 2020 the sales decline is primarily due to ongoing generic competition for products within the established brands business particularly for cardiovascular products zetia and vytorin ezetimibe and simvastatin an expiration of a distribution agreement in december 2020 for rosuzet in korea lower sales of respiratory products including singulair montelukast and dulera mometasone furoate and formoterol fumarate dihydrate generic competition for women’s health product nuvaring etonogestrelethinyl estradiol vaginal ring and the generic etonogestrelethinyl estradiol vaginal ring as well as the negative impact of volumebased procurement vbp in china in addition the covid19 pandemic continued to negatively affect sales in 2021 across several markets the overall sales decline was offset by higher sales of womens health products nexplanonimplanon nxt  follistim aq follitropin beta injection and ganirelix acetate injection due to higher demand and higher sales of biosimilars resulting from the continued uptake of renflexis and ontruzant in the united states as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange 

worldwide sales were 65 billion in 2020 a decline of 16 compared with 2019 primarily due to generic competition for women’s health product nuvaring  and ongoing generic competition for products within the established brands business particularly for respiratory products singulair and nasonex and cardiovascular products zetia and vytorin  as described above the covid19 pandemic negatively affected sales in 2020 contributing to declines in established brands particularly respiratory and cardiovascular products as well as declines in women’s health products particularly nexplanon  follistim aq and orgalutran the sales decline was partially offset by revenue resulting from an arrangement for the sale of generic etonogestrelethinyl estradiol vaginal ring higher sales of biosimilars resulting from the continued uptake of renflexis in existing markets and the launch of ontruzant into new markets as well as higher sales of cardiovascular product atozet 

the loss of exclusivity loe negatively impacted sales by approximately 300 million for 2021 compared to 2020 based on the decrease in volume period over period additionally the vbp in china continues to unfavorably affect a number of our products with an impact to sales of approximately 170 million for 2021 compared to 2020 based on the decrease in volume period over period

women’s health 

contraception 

worldwide sales of nexplanonimplanon nxt  a singlerod subdermal contraceptive implant increased 13 in 2021 primarily due to favorable impact from pricing and increased demand in the united states favorable impact from the timing of tenders in latin america and higher demand and recovery from the covid19 pandemic in the international markets

cardiovascular 

combined global sales of zetia marketed in most countries outside of the united states as ezetrol  and vytorin marketed outside of the united states as inegy  medicines for lowering ldl cholesterol decreased 18 and 24 in 2021 and 2020 respectively primarily driven by lower sales of ezetrol in japan as well as lower sales of ezetrol and inegy in the eu the patent that provided market exclusivity for ezetrol in japan expired in september 2019 and generic competition began in june 2020 the eu patents for ezetrol and inegy expired in april 2018 and april 2019 respectively accordingly we are experiencing sales declines in these markets as a result of generic competition and expect the declines to continue higher demand for ezetrol in china during 2021 resulting from expanded access partially offset the sales decline 

sales of atozet ezetimibe and atorvastatin calcium marketed outside of the united states a medicine for lowering ldl cholesterol remained relatively flat 2021 primarily due to increased competition in germany partially offset by demand increase in france and the asia pacific region sales of atozet grew 16 in 2020 primarily due to higher demand in most markets particularly in the eu japan and other countries in the asia pacific region

costs expenses and other 



 calculation not meaningful 

cost of sales 

cost of sales includes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets which totaled 103 million in 2021 86 million in 2020 and 284 million in 2019 cost of sales increased 12 in 2021 primarily due to an increase in manufacturing and freight costs as well as certain costs related to tolling arrangements with merck which were not in place in 2020 during 2021 the company recognized 24 million in cost of sales pertaining to estimated unavoidable losses associated with a longterm vendor supply contract conveyed as part of the separation due to increased competition during 2021 which resulted in the loss of contract tenders in certain markets and pricing pressure the company recorded an impairment charge of 7 million related to a product right for a biosimilar product cost of sales decreased 7 in 2020 primarily attributable to the decline in amortization expense for the intangible assets of nasonex  clarinex and atozet  which were fully amortized at the end of 2019 

gross margin was 622 676 and 708 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the gross margin decline in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects stand up costs certain costs related to tolling arrangements with merck which have lower gross margin percentages compared to product sales higher amortization expense as well as the 24 million charge associated with the longterm vendor supply contract conveyed to organon and the 7 million of impairment charge related to a biosimilar product the gross margin decline in 2020 compared with 2019 reflects pricing pressure and product mix partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets as noted above 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 23 in 2021 due to costs incurred to establish organon as a standalone entity higher employee related costs and higher selling and promotional costs selling general and administrative expenses declined 6 in 2020 primarily due to lower selling and promotional costs reflecting lower travel and meeting expenses due in part to the impact of the covid19 pandemic these declines were partially offset by costs incurred to establish organon as a standalone entity 

research and development 

research and development expenses more than doubled in 2021 primarily due to the 79 million charge for the acquisition of forendo pharma the 25 million upfront payment related to the license agreement with obseva higher expenses related to clinical development and higher employee related costs incurred to establish organon as a standalone entity research and development expenses declined 5 in 2020 primarily due to lower costs from postmarketing research activities partially offset by higher spending associated with organon development programs 

restructuring costs 

certain of our operations have been affected by restructuring plans initiated by merck the decline in restructuring costs for 2021 and 2020 is due to lower allocated costs from merck currently organon does not have an established restructuring program see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

other income expense net 

for 2021 the increase in other income expense is primarily due to 258 million of interest expense related to the issuance of the debt instruments offset by lower allocated foreign exchange hedging losses as compared to 2020 the decrease in other income expenses for 2020 was primarily due to lower allocated foreign exchange hedging losses as compared to 2019 

taxes on income 

the effective income tax rates for 2021 2020 and 2019 were 117 180 and 106 respectively the decrease in effective interest rates for 2021 reflect the beneficial impact of foreign earnings the 75 million tax benefit relating to a portion of the nonus stepup of tax basis associated with organons separation from merck as well as the income tax benefit recognized in connection with the conclusion of the internal revenue service irs examination of merck’s 20152016 us federal income tax returns as a result of the examination conclusion we reflected an allocation from merck of 18 million in the consolidated financial statements representing our portion of the payment made to the irs our portion of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the years under examination exceeded the allocated adjustments relating to this examination period and therefore for the year ended december 31 2021 we have reflected a 29 million net tax benefit this net benefit reflects reductions in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and other related liabilities for tax positions relating to the years that were under examination 

incomeloss from discontinued operations 

the historical results of certain merck nonus legal entities that were contributed to organon in connection with the separation included operations related to other merck products that were retained by merck the merck retained products business of the transferred entities were contributed by organon to merck and its affiliates accordingly the historical results of operations of the merck retained products have been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 

there was no income or loss from discontinued operations net of taxes for 2021 loss from discontinued operations net of taxes for 2020 and 2019 was 96 million and 88 million respectively 

analysis of liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity and capital resources 

up to the date of separation on june 2 2021 organon participated in merck’s centralized treasury model which included its cash pooling and other intercompany financing arrangements we have historically generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations 

in april 2021 in connection with the separation organon finance 1 previously a subsidiary of merck issued €125 billion aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior secured notes due 2028 21 billion aggregate principal amount of 4125 senior secured notes due 2028 and 20 billion aggregate principal amount of 5125 senior unsecured notes due 2031 the notes were assumed by organon and the dutch coissuer in addition on june 2 2021 we entered into a credit agreement providing for a 30 billion us dollardenominated senior secured term loan due 2028 and a euro denominated senior secured term loan in the amount of €750 million due 2028 we also entered into a secured unsubordinated fiveyear revolving credit facility that provides for the availability of 10 billion of borrowings as of december 31 2021 there are no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility we distributed 90 billion of the 95 billion proceeds to merck in accordance with the terms of the separation 

after the distribution to merck of 90 billion in net debt proceeds and settlement of certain balances with merck and its affiliates we began operations as an independent company with approximately 900 million of cash and cash equivalents which included approximately 400 million of funds received from merck for the purchase of inventory from merck upon exit of certain interim operating model agreements this purchase was completed at the end of 2021 on december 23 2021 the company made a discretionary prepayment of 100 million on the us dollar denominated term loan at december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 737 million we expect to continue to fund our ongoing operating investing and financing requirements mainly through cash flows from operations available liquidity through cash on hand available capacity under our revolving credit facility and access to capital markets 

working capital of continuing operations was 12 billion at december 31 2021 and 348 million at december 31 2020 the increase in working capital of continuing operations was primarily driven by cash funding by merck in connection with the separation and an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by increases in employee benefits and payroll accruals and interest payable 

cash provided by operating activities was 22 billion in 2021 23 billion in 2020 and 30 billion in 2019 cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was unfavorably impacted by the decline in net income and an increase in accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable including amounts due to merck and accrued and other current liabilities cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was primarily impacted by the decline in net income 

cash used in investing activities was 481 million in 2021 250 million in 2020 and 88 million in 2019 cash used in investing activities in 2021 primarily reflects the asset acquisition of forendo and alydia health and the licensing agreement with obseva cash used in investing activities in 2020 reflects an increase in capital expenditures 

cash used in financing activities was 977 million in 2021 20 billion in 2020 and 29 billion in 2019 the change in cash used in financing activities in 2021 reflects the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt the payment of related debt issuance costs and related principal payment payment of dividends and the settlement of the transactions with merck in connection with the separation see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements the change in cash used in financing activities in 2020 reflects transactions with merck 

our ability to fund our operations and anticipated capital needs is reliant upon the generation of cash from operations supplemented as necessary by periodic utilization of our revolving credit facility our principal uses of cash in the future will be primarily to fund our operations working capital needs capital expenditures repayment of borrowings payment of dividends and strategic business development transactions 

capital expenditures were 192 million in 2021 255 million in 2020 and 92 million in 2019 capital expenditures in 2021 and 2020 reflect investment in new capital projects focused primarily on establishing organon as an independent company we estimate that we will continue to invest in new capital projects from 2022 to 2023 for ongoing projects to stand up organon principally related to investments in information technology 

in february 2022 the armed conflict between ukraine and russia escalated which may adversely impact organon’s business specifically trade sanctions travel bans and asset or financial freezes announced by the united states european union and other countries against russian entities and designated individual restrictions have impacted and may continue to impact many global businesses in direct and indirect ways including but not limited to product shipping delays supply shortages delays in regulatory approvals and audits currency exchange rates and exchange controls such actions may negatively impact the financial institutions vendors manufacturers suppliers partners and other third parties with whom organon conducts business organon will continue to monitor the impacts of the conflict which may negatively impact organon’s operations financial position or cash flows for the year ended december 31 2021 organon’s combined revenues of ukraine and russia were approximately 2 of total revenues 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2021 which require material cash requirements in the future consist of purchase obligations and lease obligations purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services which include inventory purchase commitments lease obligations exclude reasonably certain lease renewals that have not yet been executed as of december 31 2021 total payments due for purchase obligations and lease obligations are 15 billion and 251 million respectively and extend through 2030 contractual obligations due within the next twelve months are 349 million related to purchase commitments and 53 million related to lease obligations in addition organon is responsible for settlement of certain tax matters of which the company expects to pay approximately 20 million within the next year 

during 2021 organon paid cash dividends of 056 per share in february 2022 the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 028 per share on organon’s stock that was paid on march 17 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 28 2022 

we believe that our financing arrangements future cash from operations and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our future cash flow needs 

critical accounting estimates 

the audited annual consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and accordingly include certain amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments a discussion of accounting estimates considered critical because of the potential for a significant impact on the financial statements due to the inherent uncertainty in such estimates are disclosed below because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates revenue is recognized following a fivestep model i identify the customer contract ii identify the contract’s performance obligation iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation and v recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied revenue is reduced for grosstonet sales adjustments discussed below all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering applicable laws and regulations and definitive contractual agreements with private sector and public sector benefit providers these types of variable consideration are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts in addition revenues are recorded net of time value of money discounts if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience 

in the united states revenue is reduced by sales discounts issued to customers at the pointofsale through an intermediary wholesaler known as chargebacks or in the form of rebate amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector managed care and public sector medicaid and medicare part d customers additionally sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 

the provision for aggregate customer discounts in the united states covers chargebacks and rebates we determine the provision for chargebacks based on expected sellthrough levels by our wholesale customers to contracted customers as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels the provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers we use historical customer segment utilization mix sales forecasts changes to product mix and price inventory levels in the distribution channel government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers health maintenance organizations pharmacy benefit managers federal and state agencies and other customers to the amounts accrued 

we continually monitor our provision for aggregate customer discounts there were no material adjustments to estimates associated with the aggregate customer discount provision in 2021 2020 or 2019 

summarized information about changes in the aggregate customer discount accrual related to sales in the united states is as follows 



1 includes 2021 payments made by merck on behalf of organon for the period prior to the separation date 

accruals for chargebacks are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts receivable and accruals for rebates as current liabilities the accrued balances relative to these provisions included in accounts receivable and accrued and other current liabilities were 54 million and 275 million respectively at december 31 2021 41 million and 302 million respectively at december 31 2020 and were 52 million and 313 million respectively at december 31 2019 

outside of the united states variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a combination of commerciallydriven discounts in highly competitive product classes discounts required to gain or maintain reimbursement or legislatively mandated rebates in certain european countries legislatively mandated rebates are calculated based on an estimate of the government’s total unbudgeted spending and our specific payback obligation rebates may also be required based on specific product sales thresholds we apply an estimated factor against our actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate obligations associated with the sale 

we maintain a returns policy that allows our customers in the united states to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date generally three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration the estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns additionally we consider factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel product dating and expiration period whether products have been discontinued entrance in the market of generic competition changes in formularies or launch of overthecounter products among others outside of the united states returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our revenue recognition policy 

contingencies and environmental liabilities 

we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to our business including product liability intellectual property and commercial litigation as well as certain additional matters including governmental and environmental matters see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable 

we believe that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on us expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were 4 million in 2021 and are estimated at 19 million in the aggregate for the years 2022 through 2026 in management’s opinion the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled 24 million at both 

december 31 2021 and 2020 these liabilities are undiscounted do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters or the ultimate costs of remediation management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed 16 million in the aggregate management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity for any year 

impairments of longlived assets 

we assess changes in economic regulatory and legal conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of our property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets the judgments made in evaluating impairment of longlived intangibles can materially affect our results of operations 

we periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of our longlived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if such circumstances are determined to exist an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets or appropriate asset groupings is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists if the asset is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value if quoted market prices are not available we estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach 

goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired goodwill is evaluated for impairment as of october 1 each year or more frequently if impairment indicators exist by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the industry and market cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows and overall financial performance if we conclude it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value a quantitative fair value test is performed if carrying value is greater than fair value a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference up to the carrying value of goodwill we completed the annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2021 and concluded that no impairment to goodwill was necessary as the fair value of the reporting unit was significantly in excess of the carrying value 

other acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value assigned an estimated useful life and amortized primarily on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives when events or circumstances warrant a review we will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings potential risks leading to impairment could include loss of exclusivity occurring earlier than expected competition pricing reductions and other macroeconomic changes impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

taxes on income 

deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit we evaluate tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we recognize the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we do not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements we recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of taxes on income in the combined statement of income 

prior to the separation we did not maintain an income taxes payable to or from account as it is deemed to be settled with the tax paying entities in the respective jurisdictions these settlements are reflected as changes in accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheet however our consolidated balance sheet reflects balances with taxing authorities and the onetime transition tax resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 as well as for unrecognized income tax benefits along with related interest and penalties 

prior to the separation income tax expense and deferred tax balances in the consolidated financial statements were calculated on a separate tax return basis we relied on certain assumptions one of them that as a standalone basis we would not benefit from certain tax incentives that historically benefited merck we believe the assumptions supporting the allocation and presentation of income taxes on a separate return basis were reasonable 

inventory valuation 

inventories consist of currently marketed products and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value inventories are assessed regularly for impairment and valuation reserves are established when necessary based on a number of factors including but not limited to product obsolescence and changes in estimates of future product demand and expiry the determination of events and the assumptions utilized in our quantification of valuation reserves may require judgement no material adjustments have been required to our inventory reserve estimates for the periods presented adverse changes in assumptions utilized in our inventory reserve calculations could result in an increase to our inventory valuation reserves and higher cost of sales 

acquisitions 

business combinations are evaluated in order to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses the company makes certain judgments which include assessment of the inputs processes and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities if the company determines that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset or a group of similar assets the company accounts for the transaction as an asset acquisition in an asset acquisition acquired iprd with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the acquisition date product development milestones are recognized upon achievement and salesbased milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable of being achieved 

to be considered a business the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs businesses acquired are consolidated upon obtaining control the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair value if fair value cannot be determined the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable if these criteria are not met no asset or liability is recognized any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred 

the fair values of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management 

pension 

our pension plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets these significant assumptions are reviewed annually and are disclosed in note 14 of the consolidated financial statements 

for our pension plans the discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality fixedincome debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due 

the expected rate of return for the pension plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid in developing the expected rate of return the company considers longterm compound annualized returns of historical market data current market conditions and actual returns on the company’s plan assets using this reference information the company develops forwardlooking return expectations for each asset category and a weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment categories the expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate 

sharebased compensation 

we expense all sharebased payment awards to employees including grants of stock options over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of certain sharebased awards is determined using the blackscholes optionpricing model which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value this method incorporates various assumptions such as the riskfree interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the options

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our earnings cash flows and equity could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we had historically managed our foreign currency risk through merck foreign currency programs we are primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the euro swiss franc and japanese yen upon separation we established a balance sheet risk management program and a net investment hedge to mitigate against volatility of changes in foreign exchange rates each quarter subsequent to separation €175 billion of our eurodenominated debt was designated as a hedge of the net investment of eurodenominated subsidiaries see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information on organon’s risk management 

interest rate risk 

our longterm debt portfolio consists of both fixed and variablerate instruments for any variable rate debt interest rate changes in the underlying index rates will impact future interest expense we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest rate risk however we may consider entering into such contracts in the future 

we estimate a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates of our variable rate debt would not materially change annual interest expense
