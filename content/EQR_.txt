business objectives and operating and investing strategies

overview 

the company is one of the largest us publiclytraded owners and operators of high quality rental apartment properties with an established presence in boston new york washington dc southern california including los angeles orange county and san diego san francisco and seattle and an expanding presence in denver atlanta dallasft worth and austin we believe our markets are knowledge centers of the us economy that draw talented workers and employers that drive economic growth in the united states we believe the locations of our properties in these markets are attractive to these knowledge workers whom we hope to convert into satisfied longterm residents

equity residential is committed to creating communities where people thrive we carry this our corporate purpose through our relationships with our customers our employees our shareholders and the communities in which we operate it drives our commitments to sustainability diversity and inclusion the total wellbeing of our employees and being a responsible corporate citizen in the communities in which we operate which has been especially relevant as we faced unprecedented challenges like the novel coronavirus “covid19” pandemic 

we believe we have created an industry‐leading operating platform and balance sheet to run our properties our employees are focused on delivering remarkable customer service to our residents so they will stay with us longer be willing to pay higher rent for a great experience and will tell others about how much they love living in an equity residential property we utilize technology and other innovative methods of engagement with our residents to foster relationships and community improve the resident experience and operate our business more efficiently we pair that with disciplined balance sheet management that enhances returns and value creation while maintaining flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities we believe that our stakeholders value stability liquidity predictability and accountability and that is the mission to which we remain unwaveringly committed

 

despite the challenges we have faced with the covid19 pandemic we believe that the longterm prospects for our business remain strong our welllocated communities are in and around dynamic cities that we believe will continue to attract affluent longterm renters with the pandemic subsiding and cities reopening we are seeing strong demand from our affluent resident base  demonstrating the longterm attractiveness of our communities 

investment strategy

the company’s longterm strategy is to invest in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our riskadjusted total returns and balancing current cash flow generation with longterm capital appreciation we seek to meet this goal by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations over the longterm the markets we focus on generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to drive performance









we believe our strategy capitalizes on the preference of renters of all ages to live in the locations where we operate which typically are near transportation both public transit and convenient highway access entertainment employment centersuniversities and cultural and outdoor amenities furthermore we believe that demand for rental housing will continue to be driven primarily through household formations from the younger segments of our population including both millennials and generation z and to a lesser extent the aging baby boomer generation 







the company continues to allocate capital in order to optimize performance by balancing current cash flow growth with longterm capital appreciation most recently we have done so by adding expansion markets to our portfolio allocation that meet the same characteristics listed above expansion into these markets of denver atlanta dallasft worth and austin includes investments in both urban and suburban properties and is generally being funded by reducing exposure in selective established markets development also plays an important role in our capital allocation development activity is focused on our inhouse pipeline our strategic partnership with toll brothers inc and joint ventures with other thirdparty developers in both established and expansion markets 

operations and innovation

we attempt to balance occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized through our customized pricing system that uses market data on current and projected demand and availability to create both current and forward pricing daily for each apartment unit we manage we focus on the resident experience and leveraging operating efficiency which we believe drives our success in renewing our residents this focus has driven strong occupancy and a high percentage of residents renewing that is in line with prepandemic levels while achieving strong renewal rate growth

 

rapidly evolving t echnology continues to drive innovation in the rental industry  we have been and continue to be a leader in deploying and investing in property technology to serve our customers better and operate more efficiently having been a first mover in such important areas as revenue management and online leasing we are focused on technology that improves our operating margins and customer experience  we use a standardized purchasing system to control our operating expenses and a business intelligence platform that allows all our team members to quickly identify and address issues and opportunities  our operations benefitted from having many of these initiatives in place during the pandemic allowing us to interact with our customers in a safe and responsible manner including selfguided tours automated responses to customer inquiries and enhanced service and maintenance management   while we believe areas such as “smart home” technology and others will provide the foundation for current and future improvements to how we do business  we will continue to consider the cost and longevity of technology capital investments and their benefits  

our commitment to environmental social and governance “esg”

at equity residential we believe a focus on esg is a key way to programmatically address stakeholder concerns as part of our corporate purpose this needs to be a sustainable endeavor in which we provide resilient properties that will stand the test of time and remain attractive to our customers and the community without negatively impacting the environment we have a dedicated inhouse team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business including investment activities development property operations and property management activities multifamily housing is one of the most environmentallyfriendly uses of real estate as each property provides homes for hundreds of families in a denser shared environment we consider building locations based on walkability accessibility neighborhoods and parks we also design our communities to support amenities such as fitness centers and we select locations near shops restaurants outdoor amenities such as bikerunning paths and health clubs enabling a low carbon footprint lifestyle for our residents to live work and play

equity residential’s sustainability program actively manages environmental impacts and climaterelated risks and opportunities through optimized financially responsible capital investments and technologies we methodically focus on energy water and emissions to advance the program’s policies targets and resilience outcomes together we believe our program drives longterm asset value responsibly manages risks and engages our communities residents employees and shareholders as part of our broader esg strategy and commitment to good corporate citizenship and maximizing investment performance

to further strengthen our commitments to esg initiatives we issued two sustainable fixedincome instruments each a “green bond” designed to support projects that contribute to environmental sustainability in 2018 the company became the first multifamily reit ever to issue a green bond with the net proceeds of approximately 3967 million from the offering allocated to the development of a property in san francisco certified as leed platinum and the acquisition of two properties certified as leed silver in 2021 the company issued a second green bond and the net proceeds of approximately 4975 million from this offering are intended to be allocated to the development or acquisition of green buildings andor investments in renewable energy energy efficiency and sustainable water management additionally during 2021 the company began funding its 100 million investment in a new fund focused on early stage sustainability and climate change mitigation technology relevant to the built environment 

we are also intensely focused on the “social” and “governance” aspects of esg as detailed below we have a commitment to our employees’ engagement diversity and inclusion and wellness that is the foundation of our corporate purpose we also recognize that a successful company must incorporate the best corporate governance practices in order to better serve its stakeholders 

for additional information regarding our esg efforts see our 2021 environmental social and governance report at our website wwwequityapartmentscom this report which includes sustainability accounting standards board disclosures and incorporates recommendations from the task force on climaterelated financial disclosures was reviewed and approved by the corporate governance committee of our board of trustees which monitors the company’s ongoing esg efforts we continue to enhance our esg disclosure efforts including auditing the results outlined in the above report furthermore our annual proxy statements contain additional information on our esg efforts including detailed information regarding our corporate governance practices such annual proxy statements and the information contained therein are not part of or incorporated into this report except as otherwise provided herein

competition

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas with multiple housing choices including other multifamily properties the number of competitive housing choices or multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other housing providers that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and singlefamily housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors  for additional information with respect to competition

regulatory considerations

see item 1a risk factors  for information concerning the potential effects of governmental regulations including environmental regulations on our operations

 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors

general

this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units op units restricted units and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own such securities as our “security holders”

risks related to the ongoing covid19 pandemic

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the pace and degree of recovery as well as the emergence of new variants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

 

during the early stages of the covid19 pandemic governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states imposed measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on movement and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines social distancing and shelterinplace orders while many of the most stringent restrictions have been removed throughout our markets the ongoing covid19 pandemic has caused and could continue to cause severe economic market and other disruptions worldwide there can be no assurance that conditions will not deteriorate as a result of the pandemic

 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic could materially negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity in a number of ways including 



















 

















the extent of the ongoing covid19 pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration spread and intensity of covid19 and its variants the distribution effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines and testing and the pace and degree of recovery from the pandemic all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition it may also continue to heighten many of the other risks described below 

risks related to our business strategy

investing in real estate is inherently subject to risks that could negatively impact our business

investing in real estate is subject to varying degrees and types of risk while we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies including geographic diversification market research and proactive asset management among other techniques these risks cannot be eliminated factors that may impact cash flows and real estate values include but are not limited to

















the geographic concentration of our properties could have an adverse effect on our operations

while the company continues to diversify its portfolio with the addition of the expansion markets the company’s properties are still predominantly concentrated in our established coastal markets if one or more of these markets is unfavorably impacted by specific economic conditions local real estate conditions increases in social unrest increases in real estate and other taxes reduced quality of life deterioration of local or state government health rent control or stabilization laws localized environmental issues or naturalmanmade disasters the impact of such conditions may have a more negative impact on our results of operations than if our properties were more geographically diverse

within its markets the company is also predominantly concentrated in certain dense urban and suburban submarkets to the extent that these markets or submarkets within these markets become less desirable to operate in including changes in multifamily housing supply and demand our results of operations could be more negatively impacted than if we were more diversified within our markets or invested in a greater number of markets 

 

competition in multifamily housing may negatively affect operations and demand for the company’s properties or residents  

our properties face competition for residents from other existing or new multifamily properties condominiums single family homes and other living arrangements whether owned or rental that may attract residents from our properties or prospective residents that would otherwise choose to live with us as a result we may not be able to renew existing resident leases or enter into new resident leases or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases they may be at rates or terms that are less favorable than our current rates or terms resulting in a material impact on our results of operations

additionally our properties face competition for residents as a result of technology innovation therefore we may not be able to retain residents or attract new residents if we are unable to identify and cost effectively implement new relevant technologies and keep up with constantly changing resident demand for the latest innovations 

the shortterm nature of apartment leases exposes us more quickly to the effects of declining market rents potentially making our results of operations and cash flows more volatile 

generally our residential apartment leases are for twelve months or less if the terms of the renewal or releasing are less favorable than current terms then the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected given our generally shorterterm lease structure our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms in addition operating expenses associated with each property such as real estate taxes insurance utilities maintenance costs and employee wages and benefits may not decline as quickly or at the same rate as revenues when circumstances might cause a reduction of those revenues at our properties 

competition for acquisitions may prevent us from acquiring properties on favorable terms

we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition and development opportunities we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms 

operations from new acquisitions development projects and renovations may fail to perform as expected

we intend to actively acquire develop and renovate multifamily operating properties as part of our business strategy newly acquired developed or renovated properties may not perform as we expect we may overestimate the revenue or underestimate the expenses that these new or repositioned properties may generate the occupancy rates and rents at these properties may also fail to meet our expectations for these investments we may also underestimate the costs necessary to operate an acquired or developed property to the standards established for its intended market position land parcels acquired for development may lose significant value prior to the start of construction development and renovations are subject to even greater uncertainties and risks due to the complexities and lead time to build or complete these projects we may also underestimate the costs to complete a development property or to complete a renovation 

construction risks on our development projects could affect our profitability

we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties through both wholly owned and joint venture arrangements as part of our business strategy development often includes long planning and entitlement timelines subjecting the project to changes in market conditions it can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in our markets we may also experience an increase in costs due to general disruptions that affect the cost of labor andor materials such as supply chain disruptions trade disputes tariffs labor unrest geopolitical conflicts or other factors that create inflationary pressures we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons and as a result we may fail to recover expenses or option payments already incurred in exploring those opportunities we may also be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or thirdparty permits and authorizations these and other risks inherent in development projects including the joint venture risks noted below could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities 

 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

real estate investments often cannot be sold quickly due to regulatory constraints market conditions or otherwise as a result we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio including the diversification of our portfolio into the expansion markets as promptly as planned or in response to changing economic or other conditions we may also be unable to consummate dispositions in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all the capitalization ratesdisposition yields at which properties may be sold could also be higher than historic rates thereby reducing our potential proceeds from sale in some cases we may also determine that we will not recover the carrying amount of the property upon disposition this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could negatively affect our financial condition including our ability to make distributions to our security holders

we are subject to risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures

we currently and may continue to in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with unrelated third parties joint ventures create risks including the following 











at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners we also have in the past and could choose in the future to guarantee part of or all of certain joint venture debt we and our respective joint venture partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time or price that is unfavorable to us  to the extent we have commitments to on behalf of or are dependent on any such offbalance sheet commitments or if those commitments or their properties or leases are subject to material contingencies our liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in some instances our joint venture partners may also have competing interests or objectives that could create conflicts of interest similar to those noted above these objectives may be contrary to our compliance with the reit requirements and our reit status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with those requirements to the extent our partners do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures or they take actions inconsistent with the interests of the joint venture it could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition including distributions to our security holders

the company’s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against our assets under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the depreciated cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and writedown the depreciated cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize material asset impairment charges in the future these charges could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

corporate social responsibility specifically related to esg may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks

environmental sustainability social and governance evaluations remain highly important to some investors and other stakeholders certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk advisory services to investors have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon esg metrics many investors focus on positive esgrelated business practices and scores when choosing to allocate their capital and may consider a companys score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision investors increased focus and activism related to esg and similar matters may constrain our business operations or increase expenses or capital expenditures in addition investors may decide to 

 

refrain from investing in us as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of esg factors  we may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies although we have generally scored highly in these metrics to date there can be no assurance that we will continue to score highly in the future in addition the criteria by which companies are rated for esg efforts may change which could cause us to receive lower scores than in previous years a low esg score could result in a negative perception of the company exclusion of our securities from consideration by certain investors who may elect to invest with our competition instead andor cause investors to reallocate their capital away from the company all of which could have an adverse impact on the price of our securities 

risks related to our financing strategy and capital structure 

disruptions in the financial markets could hinder our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions

dislocations and disruptions in capital markets could result in increased costs or lack of availability of debt financing including under our commercial paper program and equity financing such events may affect our ability to refinance existing debt require us to utilize higher cost alternatives andor impair our ability to adjust to changing economic and business conditions capital market disruptions could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions or make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may unfavorably affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell such disruptions could cause the price of our securities to decline

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could decrease the market price of our common shares

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile investors in our common shares consequently may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases due to this volatility and not necessarily related to our operating performance or prospects additionally the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to the sale of substantial amounts of our common shares or the anticipation of the sale of such shares by large holders of our securities as well as our inclusion or exclusion from stock indices the issuance of additional common shares by the company or the perception that such issuances might occur could also cause significant volatility and decreases in the value of our shares

our financial counterparties may not perform their obligations

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets or other events could impair the ability of our counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations to us there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to provide borrowings under our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to perform their obligations when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected

rising interest rates can increase costs and impact the value of the company’s assets

the company is exposed to market risk from financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates such risks derive from the refinancing of debt exposure to interest rate fluctuations in floating rate debt and from derivative instruments utilized to swap fixed rate debt to floating rates or to hedge rates in anticipation of future debt issuances increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and the costs of refinancing existing debt higher interest rates could also result in increased capitalization rates which may lead to reduced valuations of the company’s assets

insufficient cash flow could affect our ability to service existing debt and create refinancing risk

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments we may not be able to refinance existing debt and if we can the terms of such refinancing may be less favorable than the terms of existing indebtedness our inability to refinance extend or repay debt with proceeds from other capital market transactions would negatively impact our financial condition if the debt is secured the mortgage holder may also foreclose on the property 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the company’s revolving credit facility would cause the corresponding borrowing costs to increase impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and potentially impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a 

 

downgrade below investment grade would likely cause us to lose access to the commercial paper markets and would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders’ requirements at the lower ratings level 

financial covenants could limit operational flexibility and affect our overall financial position

the terms of our credit agreements including our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued require us to comply with a number of financial covenants these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness and trigger a cross default of other debt

some of our properties are financed with taxexempt bonds or otherwise contain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions including affordability requirements which limit income from certain properties the company monitors compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit from financing properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities

we may change the dividend policy for our securities in the future   

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our securities as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends is at the discretion of the board of trustees and will depend on actual and projected financial conditions the company’s actual and projected liquidity and operating results the company’s projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities and such other factors as the company’s board of trustees deems relevant  the board of trustees may modify our dividend policy from time to time and any change in our dividend policy could negatively impact the market price of our securities

issuances or sales of our common shares or units may be dilutive

any additional issuance of common shares or units would reduce the percentage of our common shares and units owned by existing investors in most circumstances shareholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common shares or units in addition depending on the terms and pricing of additional offerings of our common shares or units along with the value of our properties our shareholders and unitholders could experience dilution in both the book value and fair value of their common shares or units as well as dilution in our actual and expected earnings per share funds from operations “ffo” per share and normalized ffo per share

regulatory and tax risks

the adoption of or changes in rent control or rent stabilization regulations and eviction regulations in our markets could have an adverse effect on our operations and property values 

a growing number of state and local governments have enacted and may continue to consider enacting andor expanding rent control rent stabilization or other regulations which limit or could continue to limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees either of which could have a retroactive effect we continue to see increases in governmental entities considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent forgiveness rent control or rent stabilization regulations or expand coverage of existing regulations in our markets these regulations may also make changes to andor expand eviction and other tenants’ rights regulations that may limit our ability to enforce residents’ or tenants’ contractual rental obligations such as eviction moratoriums  pursue collections or charge certain fees which could have an adverse impact on our operations and property values 

compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs   

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements building and zoning codes environmental and other esg regulations and federal state and local accessibility requirements including and in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing act noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance existing requirements could change and compliance with future requirements may require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

environmental problems are possible and can be costly

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require current or previous owners or operators of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances at such properties the owner or operator 

 

may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred third parties may also sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect the reporting of our operations

the company follows gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as authoritative for publicly held companies the fasb and the sec create and interpret accounting standards and may issue new accounting pronouncements or change the interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements  these changes could have a material impact on our reported consolidated results of operations and financial position

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could result in a decrease of our share price

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have a negative impact on our share price

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders

we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements for which there is limited judicial and administrative interpretation however are highly technical and complex therefore we cannot guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control to qualify as a reit our assets must be substantially comprised of real estate assets as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and related guidance and our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates and would have to pay significant income taxes unless the internal revenue service “irs” granted us relief under certain statutory provisions in addition we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit we would therefore have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders and would no longer be required to make distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant negative impact on the value of our securities 

in addition certain of our subsidiary entities have elected to be taxed as reits as such each must separately satisfy all of the requirements to qualify for reit status if a subsidiary reit did not satisfy such requirements and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be taxed as a regular corporation and its income would be subject to us federal income taxation failure to comply with these complex reit rules at the subsidiary reit level can have a material and detrimental impact to eqr’s reit status

 

gain on disposition of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business is subject to 100 tax 

any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax unless certain safe harbor exceptions set forth in the code apply we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the irs may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties are prohibited transactions while we believe the irs would not prevail in any such dispute if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 

we may be subject to legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition  

at any time us federal income tax laws governing reits or impacting real estate or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be enacted or amended we cannot predict if or when any new us federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation or any amendment to any existing us federal income tax law irs and us department of treasury regulations or other administrative guidance will be adopted or become effective and any such law regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively the company and our shareholders could be negatively impacted by any such change in or any new us federal income tax law regulations or administrative guidance

distribution requirements may limit our flexibility to manage our portfolio

in order to maintain qualification as a reit under the code a reit must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains to the extent the reit does not distribute all its net capital gain or distributes at least 90 but less than 100 of its reit taxable income it will be required to pay regular us federal income tax on the undistributed amount at corporate rates in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on amounts if any by which distributions we pay in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our net capital gains and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received we may incur a reduction in tax depreciation without a reduction in capital expenditures difficulties in meeting the 90 distribution requirement might arise due to competing demands for our funds or due to timing differences between tax reporting and cash distributions because deductions may be disallowed income may be reported before cash is received expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because the irs may make a determination that adjusts reported income in addition gain from the sale of property may exceed the amount of cash received on a leverageneutral basis a substantial increase to our taxable income may reduce the flexibility of the company to manage its portfolio through dispositions of properties other than through tax deferred transactions such as section 1031 exchanges or cause the company to borrow funds or liquidate investments on unfavorable terms in order to meet these distribution requirements if we do not dispose of our properties through tax deferred transactions we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax if we fail to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement and are unable to cure the deficiency we would cease to be taxed as a reit resulting in substantial taxrelated liabilities

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes

to remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than five percent of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares the “ownership limit” absent an exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may automatically be deemed void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the company’s ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company or our shareholders

under certain circumstances we have made andor may consider making in the future a tax election to treat certain distributions to shareholders made after the close of a taxable year as having been distributed during such closed taxable year this election which is provided for in the code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability in addition the company may be required to pay interest to the irs based on such a distribution

in order to retain liquidity and continue to satisfy the reit distribution requirements the company could issue shares rather than pay a dividend entirely in cash to shareholders the irs has published several rulings which have allowed reits to offer shareholders the choice between shares or cash as a form of payment of a dividend an “elective stock dividend” however reits are generally required to structure the cash component to be no less than 20 of the total dividend paid therefore it is possible that the total tax burden to shareholders resulting from an elective stock dividend may exceed the amount of cash received by the shareholder

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to reits prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an 

 

affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving sam zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

general risk factors

risk of pandemics or other health crisis 

a pandemic epidemic or other health crisis similar to the ongoing outbreak of covid19 affecting areas where our properties corporateregional offices or major service providers are located could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in our cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of our confidential information andor damage to our reputation and business relationships all of which could negatively impact our financial results

a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt payment collections and operations corrupt data or steal confidential information including information regarding our residents prospective residents employees and employees’ dependents 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures required employee awareness training and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems and systems maintained by thirdparty vendors with which we do business are vulnerable to damage from any number of sources we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails phishing attempts ransomware or other scams persons inside our organization or personsvendors with access to our systems and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems including property infrastructure our information technology networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

we may periodically collect and store personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing activities and we may collect and store personally identifiable information of our employees and their dependents in addition we often engage thirdparty service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology security and other business services to us the systems of these thirdparty service providers may contain defects in design or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise personally identifiable information although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology networks and those of our thirdparty providers and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others a engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems b conducting periodic testing and verification of information and data security systems including performing ethical hacks of our systems to discover where any vulnerabilities may exist c providing periodic employee awareness training around phishing and other scams malware and other cyber risks and d systematically deleting personally identifiable information that no longer is required the company also has a cyber liability insurance policy to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches and data privacy regulations which provides a policy aggregate limit and a per occurrence deductible cyber liability insurance generally covers among other things costs associated with the wrongful release through inadvertent breach or network 

 

attack of personally identifiable information however there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent a cyber incident or that our cyber liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover our losses in the event of a cyber incident 

a breach or significant and extended disruption in the function of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose residents and revenues result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws generate thirdparty claims result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personally identifiable and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers our insurers or any other responsible parties as a result there can be no assurance that our financial results would not be negatively impacted

we are also subject to laws rules and regulations in the united states such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” relating to the collection use and security of resident customer employee and other data evolving compliance and operational requirements under the ccpa and the privacy laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate may impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time our failure to comply with laws rules and regulations related to privacy and data protection could harm our business or reputation or subject us to fines and penalties

the audit committee is primarily responsible for oversight of the risk management process related to cybersecurity and typically meets no less often than annually with company information technology personnel to discuss recent trends in cyber risks and the company’s strategy to defend its business systems and information against cyber attacks as well as the company’s efforts to comply with data privacy laws such as the ccpa

our business and operations rely on specialized information technology systems the failure of or inadequacy of which could impact our business

our ability to identify implement and maintain appropriate information technology systems differentiates and creates competitive advantages for us in the operations of our business these systems often are developed and hosted by thirdparty vendors whom we rely upon for ongoing maintenance upgrades and enhancements while we maintain a rigorous process around selecting appropriate information technology systems and partnering with vendors our failure to adequately do so could negatively impact our operations and competitive position

we depend on our key personnel

we depend on the efforts of our trustees and executive officers if one or more of them resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our business and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

litigation risk could affect our business

we may become involved in legal proceedings claims actions inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business these legal proceedings may include but are not limited to proceedings related to consumer shareholder securities employment environmental development condominium conversion tort eviction and commercial legal issues litigation can be lengthy and expensive and it can divert managements attention and resources results cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable outcome in litigation could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations

insurance policies can be costly and may not cover all losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

the company’s property general liability and workers compensation insurance policies provide coverage with substantial per occurrence deductibles andor selfinsured retentions these selfinsurance retentions can be a material portion of insurance losses in excess of the base deductibles while the company has previously purchased incremental insurance coverage in the event of multiple noncatastrophic occurrences within the same policy year these substantial deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses and this additional multiple occurrences coverage may not be available at all or on commercially reasonable terms in the future we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate however there are certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program as a result our financial results could be adversely affected and may vary significantly from period to period

the company relies on thirdparty insurance providers for its property general liability workers compensation and other insurance and should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact their ability to pay claims under the company’s policies 

 

earthquake risk   our policies insuring against e arthquake losses have substantial deductibles which are applied to the values of the buildings involved in the loss with the geographic concentration of our properties  a single earthquake affecting a market may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property or market as well as anticipated future revenue 

terrorism risk the company has terrorism insurance coverage which excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses

catastrophic weather and natural disaster risk our properties may be located in areas that could experience catastrophic weather and other natural disasters from time to time including wildfires snow or ice storms hail windstorms or hurricanes drought flooding or other severe disasters these severe weather and natural disasters could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which may not be covered or could exceed our insurance coverage exposure to this risk could also result in a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions 

climate change risk to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located we may experience severe weather which may result in physical damage to or decrease the demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature significant property damage or destruction of our properties could result in addition climate change could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could adversely impact the value of our properties or result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the ownership limit described above while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have all of these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of the security holders

the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less direct property operating expenses including real estate taxes and insurance the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment properties

see the same store results section below for additional discussion of those results

 

property management expenses include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any thirdparty management companies these expenses increased approximately 43 million or 46 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 this increase is primarily attributable to increases in payrollrelated costs legal and professional fees and information technologyrelated costs specifically for various operating initiatives such as salesfocused improvements and service enhancements the expenses in 2020 were lower than normal due to the impact of covid19 

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 82 million or 170 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in payrollrelated costs partially offset by decreases in office rent as a result of the consolidation of space at the company’s corporate headquarters the expenses in 2020 were lower than normal due to the impact of covid19

depreciation expense which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 174 million or 21 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2020 and 2021 and development properties placed in service during 2021 partially offset by inplace leases for 2019 acquisitions being fully depreciated as of december 31 2020 and the company being a net seller during 2020 which resulted in lower depreciation in the current period

net gain on sales of real estate properties increased approximately 5404 million or 1016 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily as a result of a higher sales volume with the sale of fourteen consolidated apartment properties in 2021 as compared to the sale of six consolidated apartment properties in the same period in 2020 

impairment increased approximately 168 million during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 due to an impairment charge in 2021 on one land parcel held for development compared to no impairment charges taken during 2020

interest and other income increased approximately 197 million during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase is primarily due to a gain of 234 million on the sale of various investment securities that occurred during 2021 but not during 2020 partially offset by decreases in insurancelitigation settlement proceeds and other noncomparable items that occurred during 2020 but not during 2021

other expenses increased approximately 18 million or 101 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in various litigation and environmental reservessettlements and an increase in ground lease finance charges partially offset by a decrease in advocacy contributions

interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 928 million or 248 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 the decrease is primarily due to lower debt extinguishment costs as well as lower overall interest rates and debt balances in 2021 as compared to 2020 the effective interest cost on all indebtedness excluding debt extinguishment costsprepayment penalties for the year ended december 31 2021 was 352 as compared to 394 in 2020 the company capitalized interest of approximately 159 million and 102 million during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately 342 million during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily as a result of the sale of two land parcels in 2020 as compared to no sales in 2021

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in partially owned properties increased approximately 31 million or 209 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020  primarily as a result of higher noncontrolling interest allocations from higher gains on the sale of one partially owned apartment property in 2021 as compared to the sale of one partially owned apartment property in 2020 

for comparison of the year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2019 refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  included in the company’s and the operating partnership’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020

despite the significant impact from the pandemic on our business which is reflected in the results for the year ended december 31 2021 a strong recovery continues across our portfolio robust economic growth coupled with reopening of cities drove our operations to recover rapidly with significant demand for our apartments in all of our markets this has led to high physical occupancy increased pricing power and a material reduction in leasing concessions key operating drivers for this performance during 2021 include





 



despite strong rent collections throughout the pandemic the financial impact from a small subset of our residents and nonresidential tenants not paying has led to higher levels of bad debt than we have historically experienced we continue to work with our residents and nonresidential tenants on meeting their financial obligations during the year ended december 31 2021 the company received governmental rental assistance payments paid on behalf of residents of approximately 347 million with approximately 163 million of that received in the fourth quarter of 2021 despite receipt of these payments our reserves and bad debt remained elevated in 2021 our bad debt allowance policies remain consistent with those in place before the pandemic

shortterm liquidity and cash proceeds

the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility and commercial paper program currently the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions 

the following table presents the company’s balances for cash and cash equivalents restricted deposits and the available borrowing capacity on its revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 and 2020 amounts in thousands

 



 

credit facility and commercial paper program

the company has a 25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing november 1 2024 the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 7500 million by adding lenders to the facility obtaining the agreement of existing lenders to increase their commitments or incurring one or more term loans the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a spread currently 0775 or based on bids received from the 

 

lending group and the company pays an annual facility fee currently 0125 both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the company’s senior unsecured credit rating

financial flexibility

eqr and erpop currently have an active universal shelf registration statement for the issuance of equity and debt securities that automatically became effective upon filing with the sec in june 2019 and expires in june 2022 per the terms of erpop’s partnership agreement eqr contributes the net proceeds of all equity offerings to the capital of erpop in exchange for additional op units on a oneforone common share per op unit basis or preference units on a oneforone preferred share per preference unit basis

the company has an atthemarket “atm” share offering program which allows eqr to issue common shares from time to time into the existing trading market at current market prices or through negotiated transactions including under forward sale arrangements the current program matures in june 2022 and gives eqr the authority to issue up to 130 million shares all of which remain outstanding as of december 31 2021 pending the settlement of the outstanding forward sale agreements these forward sale agreements allow the company at its election to settle the agreements by issuing common shares in exchange for net proceeds at the thenapplicable forward sale price specified by the agreement or alternatively to settle the agreements in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of common shares or cash issuances of shares under these forward sale agreements are classified as equity transactions accordingly no amounts relating to the forward sale agreements are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

 

until settlement occurs prior to any settlements the only impact to the consolidated financial statements is the inclusion of incremental shares if any within the calculation of diluted net income per share using the treasury stock method see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion the actual forward price per share to be received by the company upon settlement will be determined on the applicable settlement date based on adjustments made to the initial forward price to reflect the thencurrent overnight federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of the company’s common shares over the term of the forward sale agreement   

as of february 11 2022 the company had entered into such forward sale agreements under this program for a total of approximately 17 million common shares at a weighted average initial forward price per share of 8325 as of february 11 2022 no shares under the forward sale agreements had been settled these forward sale agreements must be settled by march 2023

the company may repurchase up to 130 million common shares under its share repurchase program no open market repurchases have occurred since 2008 and no repurchases of any kind have occurred since february 2014 as of february 11 2022 eqr has remaining authorization to repurchase up to 130 million of its shares 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by erpop’s longterm senior debt ratings and shortterm commercial paper ratings as well as eqr’s longterm preferred equity ratings as of february 11 2022 the ratings are as follows

definitions

the definition of certain terms described above or below are as follows 



















 



















 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2021

the company has identified the significant accounting policies below as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented

impairment of longlived assets

the company evaluates its longlived assets including its investment in real estate for indicators of impairment at least quarterly the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions legal regulatory and environmental concerns the company’s intent and ability to hold the related asset as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted assessing impairment can be complex and involves a high degree of subjectivity in determining if indicators are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or the fair value of an asset in particular these estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions including the estimation of future rental revenues operating expenses discount and capitalization rates and our intent and ability to hold the related asset all of which could be affected by our expectations about future market or economic conditions assumptions are primarily subject to propertyspecific characteristics especially with respect to our intent and ability to hold the related asset while these propertyspecific assumptions can have a significant impact on the undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of a particular asset our evaluation of the reported carrying values of longlived assets during the current year were not particularly sensitive to external or market assumptions

acquisition of investment properties

the company allocates the purchase price of properties that meet the definition of an asset acquisition to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their relative fair values using assumptions primarily based upon propertyspecific characteristics in making estimates of relative fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired or developed and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assetsliabilities acquired

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company is exposed to market risk from financial instruments primarily from changes in interest rates such risks derive from the refinancing of debt maturities from exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt and from derivative instruments utilized to swap fixed rate debt to floating or to hedge rates in anticipation of future debt issuances our operating results are therefore affected by changes in shortterm interest rates primarily libor and securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” indices which directly impact borrowings under our revolving credit facility and interest on secured and unsecured borrowings contractually tied to such rates shortterm interest rates also indirectly affect the discount on notes issued under our commercial paper program additionally we have exposure to longterm interest rates particularly us treasuries as they are utilized to price our longterm borrowings and therefore affect the cost of refinancing existing debt or incurring additional debt

in the us the alternative rates reference committee the “arrc” a group of market participants convened in 2014 to help ensure a successful transition away from usd libor has identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its preferred alternative rate as part of the transition process that is now under way libor is no longer published for certain tenors and key usd settings are expected to be discontinued by june 2023 libor is the primary basis for determining interest payments on borrowings on the company’s 25 billion revolving credit facility this facility contains provisions that establish a process for entering into an amendment to replace libor under certain circumstances we are closely monitoring the evolution of practices in the credit market and we do not expect such transition to have a material impact on the company’s financial position or cash flows

the company monitors and manages interest rates as part of its risk management process by targeting adequate levels of floating rate exposure and an appropriate debt maturity profile from time to time we may utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure and to comply with the requirements of certain lenders but not for trading or speculative purposes

the company had total variable rate debt of 06 billion representing 73 of total debt and 08 billion representing 100 of total debt as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher in 2021 and 2020 and average balances coincided with year end balances our annual interest expense would have been 61 million and 81 million higher respectively unsecured notes issued under the company’s commercial paper program are treated as variable rate debt for the purposes of this calculation even though they do not have a stated interest rate given their shortterm nature the effect of derivatives if applicable is also considered when computing the total amount of variable rate debt

changes in interest rates also affect the estimated fair market value of our fixed rate debt computed using a discounted cash flow model as of december 31 2021 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of 77 billion or 927 of total debt with an estimated fair market value of 84 billion if interest rates had been 100 basis points lower as of december 31 2021 the estimated fair market value would have increased by approximately 6372 million as of december 31 2020 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of 72 billion or 900 of total debt with an estimated fair market value of 82 billion if interest rates had been 100 basis points lower as of december 31 2020 the estimated fair market value would have increased by approximately 6866 million

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to these changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

business objectives and operating and investing strategies

overview 

the company is one of the largest us publiclytraded owners and operators of highquality rental apartment properties with a portfolio primarily located in urban and dense suburban communities in and around boston new york washington dc southern california including los angeles orange county and san diego san francisco seattle and denver our markets continue to be the primary knowledge centers of the us economy drawing the talented workers and employers that drive economic growth in the united states our properties are located in places that are attractive to knowledge workers whom we hope to convert into satisfied longterm residents

we believe we have created a bestinclass operating platform to run our properties our employees are focused on delivering remarkable customer service to our residents so they will stay with us longer be willing to pay higher rent for a great experience and will tell others about how much they love living in an equity residential property we utilize technology and other innovative methods of engagement to foster relationships and community improve the resident experience and operate our business more efficiently our disciplined balance sheet management enhances returns and value creation while maintaining flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities we believe that our stakeholders value stability liquidity predictability and accountability and that is the mission to which we remain unwaveringly committed

 

equity residential is committed to creating communities where people thrive we carry this  our corporate purpose  through our relationships with our customers our employees our shareholders and the communities in which we operate it drives our commitment to sustainability diversity and inclusion total wellbeing of our employees and being a responsible corporate citizen in the communities in which we operate  which is especially relevant when we face unprecedented challenges like the novel coronavirus “covid19” pandemic  

despite the challenges we have faced with the covid19 pandemic we believe that the longterm prospects for our business remain strong our welllocated communities are in and around dynamic cities that we believe will continue to attract high quality longterm renters when the pandemic subsides we believe urban centers will reenergize and once again provide significant networking and other benefits for current and prospective residents who may have temporarily deferred but not abandoned their desire to live in vibrant major us metropolitan areas

investment strategy

the company’s longterm strategy is to invest in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our riskadjusted total returns by balancing current cash flow generation with longterm capital appreciation we seek to meet this goal by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations over the longterm we also consider governmental fiscal health politicalregulatory risk and resiliency of our targeted markets the markets we focus on generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to drive performance











we believe our strategy capitalizes on the preference of renters of all ages to live in the locations where we operate that typically are near to transportation both public transit and convenient highway access entertainment and cultural amenities demand for rental housing is driven primarily by household formations from the millennial segment and increasingly from the generation z segment of our population millennials born between 1981 and 2000 total approximately 78 million people and are disproportionately renters they also tend to remain renters longer due to societal trends favoring delays in marriage and having children we believe we will continue to see demand from this group as the largest subsegment of this cohort is now turning 30 years old while the median age of our resident is 33 years old after the millennials comes generation z which comprises the more than 70 million people born between 2001 and 2014 reports also show a growing trend among aging baby boomers a demographic of more than 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964 toward apartment rentals 

overall our highquality resident tends to work in the highest earning sectors of the economy and is not rent burdened creating the ability to raise rents more readily in good economic times and reducing risk during downturns many of these workers are employed in the fields of science technology engineering and mathematics or stem jobs they have experienced significantly lower job loss during covid19 once it subsides we believe we are extremely well positioned to benefit for many years to come as a result of the significant impact the various generations discussed above will have on rental housing 

over the last decade the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio into urban and highly walkable closein suburban assets while we continue to look for opportunities to expand our portfolio in these locations it is our intention over time to further diversify our portfolio into select new markets that share the same characteristics as our current markets and to optimize the mix of our properties located in urban vs dense suburban submarkets within our existing markets

operations and innovation

we attempt to balance occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized through our customized pricing system that uses market data on current and projected demand and availability to create both current and forward pricing daily for each apartment unit we manage we believe our success prior to the pandemic in renewing our residents is due to our focus on the resident experience this focus has driven the strong occupancy and renewal rate growth that we have achieved over the last several years prior to the covid19 pandemic which we would expect to return once the pandemic subsides

 

t echnology continues to driv e innovation in the rental industry and to evolve at a rapid pace  we have been and continue to be a leader in deploying and investing in property technology to serve our customers better and operate more efficiently having been a first mover in such important areas as revenue management and online leasing we are focused on technology that improves our operating margin s and customer experience while also meeting the current needs of our customers  including addressing the challenges of the pandemic  we use a standardized purchasing system to control our operating expenses and a business intelligence platform that allows all our team members to quickly identify and address issues and opportunities   our operations benefitted from having many of these initiatives in place during the pandemic  allowing us to interact with our customers in a safe and responsible manner including selfguided tours  automated responses to customer inquiries and enhanced service and maintenance management  while we believe areas such as “smart home” technology and others will provide the foundation for current and future improvements to how we do business  w e will continue to consider the cost and longevity of technology capital investments versus the benefits  

our commitment to environmental social and governance “esg”

at equity residential we believe a focus on esg is a key way to programmatically address stakeholder concerns as part of our corporate purpose this needs to be a sustainable endeavor in which we provide properties that will stand the test of time and remain attractive to our customers and the community without negatively impacting the environment we have a dedicated inhouse team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business including investment activities development property operations and property management activities multifamily housing is one of the most environmentallyfriendly uses of real estate as each property provides homes for hundreds of families in a denser shared environment we consider building locations based on walkability accessibility neighborhoods and parks we also design our communities to support amenities such as fitness centers and we select locations near shops healthy restaurants and health and wellness programs enabling a low carbon footprint lifestyle for our residents to live work and play

our sustainability goals help us focus efforts and drive outcomes to create a more sustainable future for all we are especially focused on energy consumption water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we invest in developing and renovating our properties with a focus on reducing waste energy and water use by investing in energysaving technology such as those for irrigation lighting hvac and renewable energy while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets

we are also intensely focused on the “social” and “governance” aspects of esg as detailed below we have a commitment to our employees’ engagement diversity and wellness that is the foundation of our corporate purpose we also recognize that a successful company must incorporate the best corporate governance practices in order to better serve its stakeholders

competition

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas with multiple housing choices including other multifamily properties the number of competitive housing choices or multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other housing providers that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and singlefamily housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors  for additional information with respect to competition

regulatory considerations

see item 1a risk factors  for information concerning the potential effects of governmental regulations including environmental regulations on our operations

 




 item 1a risk factors

general

this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units op units restricted units and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own such securities as our “security holders”

risks related to the covid19 pandemic

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic the outbreak has led governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states to impose measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on movement and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines social distancing and shelterinplace orders the covid19 pandemic has also caused and may likely continue to cause severe economic market and other disruptions worldwide there can be no assurance that conditions will not continue to deteriorate as a result of the pandemic

 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread could materially negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity in a number of ways including 























 























the extent of the covid19 pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration spread and intensity of the outbreak and the rollout and effectiveness of vaccines all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below due to the speed with which the situation is continuing to develop we are not able at this time to estimate the effect of these factors on our business but the adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be material 

risks related to our business strategy

investing in real estate is inherently subject to risks that could negatively impact our business

investing in real estate is subject to varying degrees and types of risk while we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies including geographic diversification market research and proactive asset management among other techniques these risks cannot be eliminated factors that may impact cash flows and real estate values include but are not limited to

















 

the geographic concentration of our properties could have an adverse effect on our operations 

the company’s properties are concentrated in our primarily coastal markets and located in and around dynamic cities that we believe attract high quality longterm renters 

if one or more of our markets is unfavorably impacted by specific economic conditions local real estate conditions increases in social unrest increases in real estate and other taxes reduced quality of life deterioration of local or state government health rent control or stabilization laws localized environmental issues or naturalmanmade disasters the impact of such conditions may have a more negative impact on our results of operations than if our properties were more geographically diverse

within its primarily coastal markets the company is also concentrated in certain dense urban and suburban submarkets to the extent that these markets or submarkets within these markets become less desirable to operate in including changes in multifamily housing supply and demand our results of operations could be more negatively impacted than if we were more diversified within our markets or invested in a greater number of markets 

for example the urban core submarkets of new york city san francisco ca and boston ma have been more adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic in comparison to our other markets due to our concentrations in these submarkets we have experienced larger decreases in rental income from elevated rent concessions and lower occupancy than we might have otherwise

failure to generate sufficient revenue could limit our ability to make financing payments or distributions to security holders

a decrease in cash flows due to declines in rental revenue could negatively affect our ability to make financing payments and distributions to our security holders significant expenditures associated with each property such as real estate taxes insurance utilities maintenance costs and employee wages and benefits may also negatively impact cash flows and these expenditures may not decline as quickly or at the same rate as revenues when circumstances might cause a reduction of those revenues at our properties

competition in multifamily housing may negatively affect operations and demand for the company’s properties or residents

our properties face competition for residents from other existing or new multifamily properties condominiums single family homes and other living arrangements whether owned or rental that may attract residents from our properties or prospective residents that would otherwise choose to live with us as a result we may not be able to renew existing resident leases or enter into new resident leases or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases they may be at rates or terms that are less favorable than our current rates or terms resulting in a material impact on our results of operations

additionally our properties face competition for residents as a result of technology innovation therefore we may not be able to retain residents or attract new residents if we are unable to identify and cost effectively implement new relevant technologies and to keep up with constantly changing resident demand for the latest innovations 

the shortterm nature of apartment leases exposes us more quickly to the effects of declining market rents potentially making our revenue more volatile 

generally our residential apartment leases are for twelve months or less if the terms of the renewal or reletting are less favorable than current terms then the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected given our generally shorterterm lease structure our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms

competition for acquisitions may prevent us from acquiring properties on favorable terms

we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition and development opportunities we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms 

operations from new acquisitions development projects and renovations may fail to perform as expected

we intend to actively acquire develop and renovate multifamily operating properties as part of our business strategy newly acquired developed or renovated properties may not perform as we expect we may also overestimate the revenue or underestimate the expenses that a new or repositioned project may generate the occupancy rates and rents at these properties may fail to meet the expectations underlying our investment development and renovations are subject to greater uncertainties and risks due to complexities and lead time in estimating costs we may underestimate the costs necessary to operate an acquired property to the 

 

standards established for its intended market position  we may also underestimate the costs to complete a development property or to complete a renovation 

construction risks on our development projects could affect our profitability

we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties as part of our business strategy development often includes long planning and entitlement timelines subjecting the project to changes in market conditions it can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in our markets we may also experience an increase in costs due to general disruptions that affect the cost of labor andor materials such as trade disputes tariffs labor unrest andor geopolitical conflicts we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons and as a result we may fail to recover expenses or option payments already incurred in exploring those opportunities we may also be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or thirdparty permits and authorizations these and other risks inherent in development projects could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic or other conditions we may be unable to consummate such dispositions in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all in some cases we may also determine that we will not recover the carrying amount of the property upon disposition this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could negatively affect our financial condition including our ability to make distributions to our security holders

the company’s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against our assets under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the depreciated cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and writedown the depreciated cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize material asset impairment charges in the future these charges could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures

we currently and may continue to in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities joint ventures create risks including the following 









at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners we also have in the past and could choose in the future to guarantee part of or all of certain joint venture debt we and our respective joint venture partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time or price that is unfavorable to us  in some instances joint venture partners may also have competing interests or objectives that could create conflicts of interest similar to those noted above these objectives may be contrary to our compliance with the reit requirements and our reit status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with those requirements to the extent our partners do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures or they take actions inconsistent with the interests of the joint venture it could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition including distributions to our security holders

 

corporate social responsibility specifically related to esg may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

sustainability social and governance evaluations remain highly important to investors and other stakeholders certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk advisory services to investors have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon esg metrics many investors focus on positive esgrelated business practices and scores when choosing to allocate their capital and may consider a companys score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision investors increased focus and activism related to esg and similar matters may constrain our business operations or increase expenses in addition investors may decide to refrain from investing in us as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of esg factors we may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies although we have generally scored highly in these metrics to date there can be no assurance that we will continue to score highly in the future in addition the criteria by which companies are rated for esg efforts may change which could cause us to receive lower scores than in previous years a low esg score could result in a negative perception of the company exclusion of our securities from consideration by certain investors who may elect to invest with our competition instead andor cause investors to reallocate their capital away from the company all of which could have an adverse impact on the price of our securities

risks related to our financing strategy and capital structure 

disruptions in the financial markets could hinder our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions

dislocations and disruptions in capital markets could result in increased costs or lack of availability of debt financing including under our commercial paper program and equity financing such events may affect our ability to refinance existing debt require us to utilize higher cost alternatives andor impair our ability to adjust to changing economic and business conditions capital market disruptions could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions or make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may unfavorably affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell such disruptions could cause the price of our securities to decline

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could decrease the market price of our common shares

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile investors in our common shares consequently may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases due to this volatility and not necessarily related to our operating performance or prospects additionally the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to the sale of substantial amounts of our common shares or the anticipation of the sale of such shares by large holders of our securities the issuance of additional common shares by the company or the perception that such issuances might occur could also cause significant volatility and decreases in the value of our shares

our financial counterparties may not perform their obligations

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets or other events could impair the ability of our counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations to us there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to provide borrowings under our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to perform their obligations when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected

rising interest rates can increase costs

the company is exposed to market risk from financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates such risks derive from the refinancing of debt exposure to interest rate fluctuations in floating rate debt and from derivative instruments utilized to swap fixed rate debt to floating rates or to hedge rates in anticipation of future debt issuances increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and the costs of refinancing existing debt

insufficient cash flow could affect our ability to service existing debt and create refinancing risk

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments we may not be able to refinance existing debt and if we can the terms of such refinancing may be less favorable than the terms of existing indebtedness our inability to refinance extend or repay debt with proceeds from other capital market transactions would negatively impact our financial condition if the debt is secured the mortgage holder may also foreclose on the property 

 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the company’s revolving credit facility would cause the corresponding borrowing costs to increase impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and potentially impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would likely cause us to lose access to the commercial paper markets and would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders’ requirements at the lower ratings level

financial covenants could limit operational flexibility and affect our overall financial position

the terms of our credit agreements including our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued require us to comply with a number of financial covenants these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness and trigger a cross default of other debt

some of our properties are financed with taxexempt bonds or otherwise contain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions including affordability requirements which limit income from certain properties the company monitors compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit from financing properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities

we may change the dividend policy for our securities in the future   

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our securities as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends is at the discretion of the board of trustees and will depend on actual and projected financial conditions the company’s actual and projected liquidity and operating results the company’s projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities and such other factors as the company’s board of trustees deems relevant  the board of trustees may modify our dividend policy from time to time and any change in our dividend policy could negatively impact the market price of our securities

issuances or sales of our common shares or units may be dilutive

any potential additional issuance of common shares or op units would reduce the percentage of our common shares and op units owned by investors in most circumstances shareholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common shares or units in addition depending on the terms and pricing of additional offerings of our common shares or units along with the value of our properties our shareholders and unitholders could experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common shares or units as well as dilution in our actual and expected earnings per share funds from operations “ffo” per share and normalized ffo per share

regulatory and tax risks

the adoption of or changes in rent control or rent stabilization regulations and eviction regulations in our markets could have an adverse effect on our operations and property values 

a growing number of state and local governments have enacted and may continue to consider enacting andor expanding rent control or rent stabilization regulations which have limited and could continue to limit in broadening ways our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees either of which could have a retroactive effect we continue to see increases in governments considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent forgiveness rent control or rent stabilization regulations or expand coverage of existing regulations in our markets these regulations may also make changes to andor expand eviction and other tenants’ rights regulations that may limit our ability to enforce residents’ or tenants’ contractual rental obligations such as eviction moratoriums  pursue collections or charge certain fees which could have an adverse impact on our operations and property values 

compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs   

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements building and zoning codes and federal state and local accessibility requirements including and in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing act noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance existing requirements could change and compliance with future requirements may require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require current or previous owners or operators of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances at such properties the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred third parties may also sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect the reporting of our operations

the company follows gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as authoritative for publicly held companies the fasb and the sec create and interpret accounting standards and may issue new accounting pronouncements or change the interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements  these changes could have a material impact on our reported consolidated results of operations and financial position

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could result in a decrease of our share price

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have a negative impact on our share price

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders

we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements for which there is limited judicial and administrative interpretation however are highly technical and complex therefore we cannot guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control to qualify as a reit our assets must be substantially comprised of real estate assets as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and related guidance and our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates including for years prior to 2018 any alternative minimum tax and would have to pay significant income taxes unless the internal revenue service “irs” granted us relief under certain statutory provisions in addition we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit we would therefore have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders and would no longer be required to make distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant negative impact on the value of our securities 

in addition certain of our subsidiary entities have elected to be taxed as reits as such each must separately satisfy all of the requirements to qualify for reit status if a subsidiary reit did not satisfy such requirements and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be taxed as a regular corporation and its income would be subject to us federal income taxation failure to comply with these complex reit rules at the subsidiary reit level can have a material and detrimental impact to eqr’s reit status

 

gain on disposition of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business is subject to 100 tax 

any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax unless certain safe harbor exceptions set forth in the code apply we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the irs may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties are prohibited transactions while we believe the irs would not prevail in any such dispute if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 

we may be subject to legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition  

at any time us federal income tax laws governing reits or impacting real estate or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be enacted or amended we cannot predict if or when any new us federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation or any amendment to any existing us federal income tax law irs and us department of treasury regulations or other administrative guidance will be adopted or become effective and any such law regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively the company and our shareholders could be negatively impacted by any such change in or any new us federal income tax law regulations or administrative guidance

distribution requirements may limit our flexibility to manage our portfolio

in order to maintain qualification as a reit under the code a reit must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains to the extent the reit does not distribute all its net capital gain or distributes at least 90 but less than 100 of its reit taxable income it will be required to pay regular us federal income tax on the undistributed amount at corporate rates in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on amounts if any by which distributions we pay in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our net capital gains and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received we may incur a reduction in tax depreciation without a reduction in capital expenditures difficulties in meeting the 90 distribution requirement might arise due to competing demands for our funds or due to timing differences between tax reporting and cash distributions because deductions may be disallowed income may be reported before cash is received expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because the irs may make a determination that adjusts reported income in addition gain from the sale of property may exceed the amount of cash received on a leverageneutral basis a substantial increase to our taxable income may reduce the flexibility of the company to manage its portfolio through dispositions of properties other than through tax deferred transactions or cause the company to borrow funds or liquidate investments on unfavorable terms in order to meet these distribution requirements if we fail to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement and are unable to cure the deficiency we would cease to be taxed as a reit resulting in substantial taxrelated liabilities

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes

to remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than five percent of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares the “ownership limit” absent an exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may automatically be deemed void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the company’s ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company or our shareholders

under certain circumstances we have made andor may consider making in the future a tax election to treat certain distributions to shareholders made after the close of a taxable year as having been distributed during such closed taxable year this election which is provided for in the code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability in addition the company may be required to pay interest to the irs based on such a distribution

in order to retain liquidity and continue to satisfy the reit distribution requirements the company could issue shares rather than pay a dividend entirely in cash to shareholders the irs has published several rulings which have allowed reits to offer shareholders the choice between shares or cash as a form of payment of a dividend an “elective stock dividend” however reits are generally required to structure the cash component to be no less than 20 of the total dividend paid therefore it is possible that the total tax burden to shareholders resulting from an elective stock dividend may exceed the amount of cash received by the shareholder

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to reits prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested 

 

shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving sam zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

general risk factors

risk of pandemics or other health crisis 

a pandemic epidemic or other health crisis similar to the recent outbreak of covid19 affecting areas where our properties corporateregional offices or major service providers are located could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in our cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of our confidential information andor damage to our reputation and business relationships all of which could negatively impact our financial results

a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt payment collections and operations corrupt data or steal confidential information including information regarding our residents prospective residents employees and employees’ dependents 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures required employee awareness training and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems and systems maintained by thirdparty vendors with which we do business are vulnerable to damage from any number of sources we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails phishing attempts ransomware or other scams persons inside our organization or personsvendors with access to our systems and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems including property infrastructure our information technology networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees and their dependents in addition we engage thirdparty service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology security and other business services to us the systems of our thirdparty service providers may contain defects in design or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise personally identifiable information although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology networks and those of our thirdparty providers and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others a engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems b conducting periodic testing and verification of information and data security systems including performing ethical hacks of our systems to discover where any vulnerabilities may exist and c providing periodic employee awareness training around phishing and other scams malware and other cyber risks the company also has a cyber liability insurance policy to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches and data privacy regulations which provides a policy aggregate limit and a per occurrence deductible cyber liability insurance generally covers among other things costs associated with the wrongful release through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information however there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent a cyber incident or that our cyber liability insurance coverage will be sufficient in the event of a cyber incident

a breach or significant and extended disruption in the function of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose residents and revenues result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws generate thirdparty 

 

claims result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personally identifiable and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers our insurers or any other responsible parties as a result there can be no assurance that our financial results would not be negatively impacted 

we are also subject to laws rules and regulations in the united states such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” relating to the collection use and security of resident customer employee and other data evolving compliance and operational requirements under the ccpa and the privacy laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate may impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time our failure to comply with laws rules and regulations related to privacy and data protection could harm our business or reputation or subject us to fines and penalties

the audit committee is primarily responsible for oversight of the risk management process related to cybersecurity and typically meets no less often than annually with company information technology personnel to discuss recent trends in cyber risks and the company’s strategy to defend its business systems and information against cyber attacks as well as the company’s efforts to comply with data privacy laws such as the ccpa

our business and operations rely on specialized information technology systems the failure of or inadequacy of which could impact our business

our ability to identify implement and maintain appropriate information technology systems differentiates and creates competitive advantages for us in the operations of our business these systems often are developed and hosted by third party vendors whom we rely upon for ongoing maintenance upgrades and enhancements while we maintain a rigorous process around selecting appropriate information technology systems and partnering with vendors our failure to adequately do so could negatively impact our operations and competitive position

we depend on our key personnel

we depend on the efforts of our trustees and executive officers if one or more of them resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our business and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

litigation risk could affect our business

we may become involved in legal proceedings claims actions inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business these legal proceedings may include but are not limited to proceedings related to consumer shareholder securities employment environmental development condominium conversion tort eviction and commercial legal issues litigation can be lengthy and expensive and it can divert managements attention and resources results cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable outcome in litigation could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations

insurance policies can be costly and may not cover all losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

the company’s property general liability and workers compensation insurance policies provide coverage with substantial per occurrence deductibles andor selfinsured retentions these selfinsurance retentions can be a material portion of insurance losses in excess of the base deductibles while the company has previously purchased incremental insurance coverage in the event of multiple noncatastrophic occurrences within the same policy year these substantial deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses and this additional multiple occurrences coverage may not be available at all or on commercially reasonable terms in the future we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate however there are certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program as a result our financial results could be adversely affected and may vary significantly from period to period

the company relies on thirdparty insurance providers for its property general liability workers compensation and other insurance and should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact their ability to pay claims under the company’s policies 

earthquake risk our policies insuring against earthquake losses have substantial deductibles which are applied to the values of the buildings involved in the loss with the geographic concentration of our properties a single earthquake affecting a market may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property or market as well as anticipated future revenue 

 

terrorism risk the company has terrorism insurance coverage which excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses 

catastrophic weather and natural disaster risk our properties may be located in areas that could experience catastrophic weather and other natural disasters from time to time including wildfires snow or ice storms windstorms or hurricanes flooding or other severe disasters these severe weather and natural disasters could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which may not be covered or could exceed our insurance coverage exposure to this risk could also result in a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions 

climate change risk to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located we may experience severe weather which may result in physical damage to or decrease the demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature significant property damage or destruction of our properties could result in addition climate change could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the ownership limit described above while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have all of these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of the security holders

covid19 impact

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 a pandemic the continued rapid development and fastchanging nature of the covid19 pandemic creates many unknowns that have had and could continue to have a significant future impact on the company its duration severity and the extent of the adverse health impact on the general population our residents and employees the rollout and effectiveness of vaccines and the potential longterm changes in customer preferences for living in our communities are among the many unknowns these among other items have impacted the economy the unemployment rate and our operations and could materially affect our future consolidated results of operations financial condition liquidity investments and overall performance for additional details see item 1a risk factors  

we have been supporting our residents and employees during the covid19 pandemic by





 







while the pandemic remains a significant health threat cities continue to work towards safely reopening their economies and to managing closures in ways that create the least amount of economic impact we expect that employers will bring back employees to their offices deliberately and safely we believe proximity to employment and to entertainment and social amenities in urban centers will continue to have value employers also continue to invest in the future committing to longterm office obligations in our markets where they continue to create collaborative work environments

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company collected approximately 97 of its expected residential revenues in the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 we believe that 2021 will be a year of recovery for the company operating trends are improving and we believe that the first half of 2021 will be the low point in our financial results our affluent wellemployed resident base remains drawn to our nation’s great cities and we expect demand to accelerate and pricing to continue to improve as vaccines are widely administered and cities become more active

see note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s real estate transactions

the company’s guidance assumes consolidated rental acquisitions will be approximately equal to consolidated rental dispositions for the full year ending december 31 2021 we currently budget spending approximately 2200 million on development costs during the year ending december 31 2021 primarily for properties currently under construction certain of these costs are expected to be funded by thirdparty construction mortgages and joint venture partner obligations work at all of our development projects continues with no material delays after some construction disruptions due to covid19

same store results

properties that the company owned and were stabilized see definition below for all of both 2020 and 2019 the “2020 same store properties” which represented 73585 apartment units impacted the company’s results of operations the 2020 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs

the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less direct property operating expenses including real estate taxes and insurance the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment properties

 

the following tables provide a rollforward of the apartment units included in same store properties and a reconciliation of apartment units included in same store properties to those included in total properties for the year ended december 31 2020

the following table provides guidance for our expected full year 2021 same store operating performance



although 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business we believe that initial signs of improvement have emerged and are optimistic that 2021 will be a year of recovery we have begun to see improvements across our portfolio for both urban and suburban properties in physical occupancy and pricing notably this is the first time this has occurred since july 2020 we continue to test price sensitivity in many markets by reducing both the value and quantity of leasing concessions being granted and are beginning to raise rents from recent prior months while forward trends are improving our reported results for 2021 particularly in the first half will continue to be severely impacted by the pandemic however we believe our results will steadily improve through the second half of 2021 as recovery accelerates in the meantime the company remains focused on the following performance indicators







in summary the operating environment remains challenging but we are beginning to see what we believe are signs of improvement see below for specific discussion on operating performance by geographic market



 















 

d espite strong rent collections throughout the pandemic its economic impact on a small subset of our residents and nonresidential tenants has led to higher levels of bad debt than we have historically experienced we continue to work with our residents and nonresidential tenants on payment plans and collections and our bad debt allowance policies remain consistent we expect our reserves and bad debt expense to remain elevated in 2021 see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of leases at december 31 2020

we anticipate same store expenses to increase between 30 to 40 for 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase in same store expenses is expected to be primarily due to the following items

 



 



 



 

 



 

the company anticipates same store noi to decline for the full year 2021 by approximately 150 to 120 as a result of the same store revenue and expense expectations discussed above given the continued uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic we anticipate the possibility of greater variability around the midpoint up or down within these ranges than we would typically experience in the normal course of business

nonsame storeother results

nonsame storeother noi results for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased approximately 224 million compared to the same period of 2019 these results consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2019 and 2020 operations from the company’s development properties and operations prior to disposition from 2019 and 2020 sold properties this difference is due primarily to

the following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings per shareunit for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 

 



 

the decrease in consolidated noi is primarily a result of the company’s lower noi from same store properties largely due to the economic impact from the covid19 pandemic and disposition activity the following table presents the changes in the components of consolidated noi for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019

 



 



property management expenses include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any thirdparty management companies these expenses decreased approximately 15 million or 16 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 this decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in payrollrelated costs inclusive of lower performance bonuses travel costs and trainingconference costs partially offset by increases in 

 

information technology related costs specifically for various operating initiatives such as salesfocused improvements and service enhancements as well as increases in legal and professional fees  the company suspended the majority of all travel and trainingconference activities as a result of the covid19 pandemic   the company anticipates that property management expenses will approximate 965 million to 985 million for the year ending december 31 2021 

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses decreased approximately 45 million or 84 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to decreases in payrollrelated costs inclusive of lower performance bonuses as a result of the company’s executive succession program during the past two years decreases in travel costs and trainingconference activities which were mostly suspended as a result of the covid19 pandemic and decreases in office rent as a result of the consolidation of space at the company’s corporate headquarters the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 530 million to 550 million for the year ending december 31 2021

depreciation expense which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets decreased approximately 103 million or 12 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to the company being a net seller during 2020 which resulted in lower depreciation from properties sold in 2019 and 2020 as compared to the additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2019 and 2020 and development properties placed in service during 2019

net gain on sales of real estate properties increased approximately 842 million or 188 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of the sale of six consolidated apartment properties sold for a higher gain in 2020 as compared to the sale of eleven consolidated properties in 2019

interest and other income increased approximately 27 million or 854 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase is primarily due to higher insurancelitigation settlement proceeds and other noncomparable items that occurred during 2020 but not during 2019 partially offset by decreases in shortterm investment income on cash and restricted deposit accounts in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to a lower rate environment and lower overall invested balances

other expenses decreased approximately 07 million or 37 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in various consulting costs related to a data analytics project which was completed in 2019 and litigation and environmental settlements partially offset by increases in advocacy contributions and pursuit costs in 2020 as compared to 2019 

interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 277 million or 69 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease is primarily due to lower overall debt balances outstanding between the periods as a result of deploying disposition proceeds to repay and discharge debt as well as lower overall interest rates partially offset by higher debt extinguishment costs in 2020 as compared to 2019 the effective interest cost on all indebtedness excluding debt extinguishment costsprepayment penalties for the year ended december 31 2020 was 394 as compared to 420 in 2019 the company capitalized interest of approximately 102 million and 69 million during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the company anticipates that interest expense excluding debt extinguishment costsprepayment penalties will approximate 2700 million to 2765 million and capitalized interest will approximate 145 million to 165 million for the year ending december 31 2021

income and other tax expense increased approximately 31 million during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to various alternative minimum tax credit refunds recognized in 2019 that did not occur in 2020 

income from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 692 million during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of a 695 million gain on the sale of two unconsolidated properties in 2019 that did not occur in 2020 

net gain on sales of land parcels increased approximately 322 million during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a higher gain on the sale of two land parcels in 2020 as compared to the sale of two land parcels in 2019 

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in partially owned properties decreased approximately 116 million during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019  primarily as a result of noncontrolling interest allocations related to the sale of one partially owned apartment property in 2020 as compared to no sales in 2019 

for comparison of the year ended december 31 2019 to the year ended december 31 2018 refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  included in the company’s and the operating partnership’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019

shortterm liquidity and cash proceeds

the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility and commercial paper program currently the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions

the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains provisions that establish a process for entering into an amendment to replace libor under certain circumstances such as the anticipated phaseout of libor by the end of 2021 at this time it cannot be determined with certainty what interest rates may succeed libor if any and how any successor or alternative rates for libor may affect borrowing costs or the availability of variable interest rate borrowings

 

the company ma y borrow up to a maximum of 10 b illion under its commercia l paper program subject to market conditio ns the notes will be sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness while the covid19 pandemic initially caused temporary disruption s in the commercial paper market in march 2020 the company has maintained access to this market and expects to continue to be able to do so in the future

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in three major categories and several subcategories













all replacements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above





 













all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects may be restricted by other thresholds ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset

the third major category is renovations which primarily consists of expenditures for kitchens and baths designed to reposition the apartment unitsproperties for higher rental levels in their respective markets all renovation expenditures are depreciated over a tenyear estimated useful life

for the year ended december 31 2020 our actual capital expenditures to real estate included the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts

the covid19 pandemic has led us to temporarily slow our capital expenditures including our renovation activities to those deemed essential governmental movement restrictions social distancing requirements and in some cases difficulty in procuring materials and labor make continuing these activities more difficult

the company estimates that during 2021 it will spend approximately 1950 per same store apartment unit or 1500 million of total capital expenditures to real estate for same store properties included in these total expected expenditures are approximately 250 million for apartment unit renovation expenditures on approximately 1250 same store apartment units at an average cost of approximately 20000 per apartment unit renovated the anticipated total capital expenditures to real estate for same store properties represent a higher absolute and per unit dollar amount as compared to 2020 but a lower absolute and per unit dollar amount as compared to 2019 as the company anticipates slowly returning its capital expenditure activity to more normalized precovid19 levels

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 201 million the company expects to fund approximately 21 million in total nonreal estate capital additions in 2021 these anticipated fundings are significantly lower than in 2020 primarily due to corporate office renovations completed during 2020

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investment in real estate for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions legal regulatory and environmental concerns the company’s intent and ability to hold the related asset as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted assessing impairment can be complex and involves a high degree of subjectivity in determining if indicators are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or the fair value of an asset in particular these estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions including the estimation of future rental revenues operating expenses discount and capitalization rates and our intent and ability to hold the related asset all of which could be affected by our expectations about future market or economic conditions these estimates can have a significant impact on the undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset

acquisition of investment properties

the company allocates the purchase price of properties that meet the definition of an asset acquisition to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their relative fair values in making estimates of relative fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in 

 

connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company is exposed to market risk from financial instruments primarily from changes in interest rates such risks derive from the refinancing of debt maturities from exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt and from derivative instruments utilized to swap fixed rate debt to floating or to hedge rates in anticipation of future debt issuances our operating results are therefore affected by changes in shortterm interest rates primarily london interbank offered rate “libor” and securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” indices which directly impact borrowings under our revolving credit facility and interest on secured and unsecured borrowings contractually tied to such rates shortterm interest rates also indirectly affect the discount on notes issued under our commercial paper program additionally we have exposure to longterm interest rates particularly us treasuries as they are utilized to price our longterm borrowings and therefore affect the cost of refinancing existing debt or incurring additional debt

the company monitors and manages interest rates as part of its risk management process by targeting adequate levels of floating rate exposure and an appropriate debt maturity profile from time to time we may utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure and to comply with the requirements of certain lenders but not for trading or speculative purposes see also note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments

the company had total variable rate debt of 08 billion representing 100 of total debt and 14 billion representing 153 of total debt as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher in 2020 and 2019 and average balances coincided with year end balances our annual interest expense would have been 81 million and 138 million higher respectively unsecured notes issued under the company’s commercial paper program are treated as variable rate debt for the purposes of this calculation even though they do not have a stated interest rate given their shortterm nature the effect of derivatives if applicable is also considered when computing the total amount of variable rate debt

changes in interest rates also affect the estimated fair market value of our fixed rate debt computed using a discounted cash flow model as of december 31 2020 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of 72 billion or 900 of total debt with an estimated fair market value of 82 billion if interest rates had been 100 basis points lower as of december 31 2020 the estimated fair market value would have increased by approximately 6866 million as of december 31 2019 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of 77 billion or 847 of total debt with an estimated fair market value of 82 billion if interest rates had been 100 basis points lower as of december 31 2019 the estimated fair market value would have increased by approximately 6644 million

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to these changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results

 

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

business objectives and operating and investing strategies

overview

the company is one of the largest us publiclytraded owners of rental apartments with a portfolio of properties primarily located in boston new york washington dc seattle san francisco southern california including los angeles orange county and san diego and denver continued high wage job and income growth positive demographics and a consumer preference for a rental lifestyle in our highly desirable markets has created a supportive backdrop for our business our markets continue to draw skilled knowledge workers that drive economic growth in the united states this in turn attracts employers to our markets seeking to locate and expand their businesses and employ this talented pool of workers resulting in strong demand for our product 

we believe we have created a bestinclass operating platform to run our properties our employees are focused on delivering remarkable customer service to our residents so they will stay with us longer be willing to pay higher rent for a great experience and will tell their friends about how much they love living in an equity residential property increasingly we are using technology to improve this resident experience and to operate our business more efficiently our disciplined balance sheet management enhances returns and value creation while maintaining capacity to take advantage of future opportunities we are committed to sustainability diversity and inclusion the total wellbeing of our employees and being a responsible corporate citizen in the communities in which we operate these “equity values” are deeply embedded in our culture we believe that our stakeholders value stability liquidity predictability and accountability and that is the mission to which we remain unwaveringly committed

 

investment strategy 

the company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets primarily urban and highdensity suburban locations with the goal of maximizing our riskadjusted total returns by balancing current cash flow generation with longterm capital appreciation we seek to meet this goal by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations over the longterm these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to drive performance













we believe our strategy capitalizes on the increasing preference of renters of all ages to live in the urban core of cities or dense suburban locations near transit entertainment and cultural amenities currently demand for rental housing is driven primarily by household formations from the millennial segment of our population also known as the echo boom generation that now comprises the largest segment of the us population these young adults born between 1981 and 2000 currently total approximately 78 million people and are disproportionately renters we also expect this demographic to remain renters longer due to societal trends favoring delays in marriage and having children we believe we will continue to see demand from this group as the largest subsegment of this cohort is now turning 29 years old while the median age of our resident is 33 years old following the millenials is generation z which comprises the more than 70 million people born between 2001 and 2014 reports also show a growing trend among aging baby boomers a demographic of more than 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964 toward apartment rentals we believe we are extremely well positioned to benefit for many years to come as a result of the significant impact these generations will have on rental housing

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio into urban and highly walkable closein suburban assets while we continue to look for opportunities to expand our portfolio in these locations we also have been exploring other markets that share these same characteristics such as denver these markets feature strong high wage job growth high single family home prices and a very attractive lifestyle for our target demographic which we believe will lead to longterm outperformance for a rental market 

operations and innovation

we balance occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized through our customized pricing system that uses market data on current and projected demand and availability to create both current and forward pricing daily for each apartment unit we manage we believe our great success with renewal rate growth is due to our motivation to retain our residents with a relentless focus on customer service highly satisfied residents stay longer and say great things about us we also use a standardized purchasing system to control our operating expenses and a business intelligence platform that allows all our team members to quickly identify and address issues and opportunities

the technology driving the rental industry continues to evolve at a rapid pace and we have long been a leader in deploying and investing in property technology to serve our customers better and operate more efficiently as a first mover in such important areas as revenue management online leasing centralized procurement and internet listing services we are focused on technology that improves our operating margin and customer experience currently we are focused on areas such as selfguided tours enabled by technology automated responses to customer inquiries data analytics to drive expense savings and revenue improvements and “smart home” technology we believe these areas will provide the foundation for current and future improvements to how we do business

 

focus on our employees 

the company has a strong rich culture with a commitment to our “equity values” of diversity  inclusion “total wellbeing” which brings together physical financial career social and community wellbeing into a cohesive whole sustainability and social responsibility we actively elevate and support these values when employees’ voices are heard and we embrace each other regardless of our differences when we give back to our communities when we care for and preserve our environment and when we encourage and enable our employees and their families to thrive in all areas of wellbeing our employeeled equity values council leads our efforts on these values by acting as change agents to drive initiatives and create awareness we engage our stakeholders for feedback on key issues and environmental social and governance “esg” factors help guide our investment and operating strategy additionally executive compensation is based in part on meeting these important equity values goals and our board of trustees takes an active role in overseeing these matters

our goal is to create and sustain an inclusive environment where diversity will thrive employees will want to work and residents will want to live the equity values council drives new diversityfocused initiatives for recruitment career development and education we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions we survey our employees annually to identify strengths and opportunities in employee satisfaction we continue to maintain high engagement scores in these surveys and find our employees say they are proud to work at the company value one another as colleagues believe in our mission and values and feel their skills meet their job requirements the company was honored with a glassdoor employees’ choice award recognizing the company as one of the 100 best places to work in 2019 among all united states large companies was in the top 50 on the overall list and was the highest rated real estate company in this survey indeed also recognized the company as a toprated workplace in many of our markets

our commitment to esg

our purpose is creating communities where people thrive this needs to be a sustainable endeavor in which we provide properties that will stand the test of time and remain attractive to our customers and the community without negatively impacting the environment we have a dedicated inhouse team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business including investment activities development property operations and property management activities multifamily housing is one of the most environmentallyfriendly uses of real estate as each property provides homes for hundreds of families in a denser shared environment we invest in locations that are highly walkable and transitfriendly enabling a low carbon footprint lifestyle for our residents to live work and play

our sustainability goals help us focus efforts and track progress we are especially focusing on energy consumption water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we invest in developing and renovating our properties with a focus on reducing waste energy and water use by investing in energysaving technology such as those for irrigation lighting hvac and renewable energy while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s results of operations and liquidity

competition

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors  for additional information with respect to competition

environmental considerations

see item 1a risk factors  for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations

 




 item 1a risk factors

general

this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units op units restricted units and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own such securities as our “security holders”

risks related to our business strategy

investing in real estate is inherently subject to risks that could negatively impact our business

investing in real estate is subject to varying degrees and types of risk while we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies including geographic diversification market research and proactive asset management among other techniques these risks cannot be eliminated factors that may impact cash flows and real estate values include but are not limited to

















competition in multifamily housing may negatively affect operations and demand for the company’s properties or residents

our properties face competition for residents from other existing or new multifamily properties condominiums single family homes and other living arrangements whether owned or rental that may attract residents from our properties or prospective residents that would otherwise choose to live with us as a result we may not be able to renew existing resident leases or enter into new resident leases or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases they may be at rates or terms that are less favorable than our current rates or terms resulting in a material impact on our results of operations

failure to generate sufficient revenue could limit our ability to make financing payments or distributions to security holders

a decrease in cash flows due to declines in rental revenue could negatively affect our ability to make financing payments and distributions to our security holders significant expenditures associated with each property such as real estate taxes insurance utilities maintenance costs and employee wages and benefits may also negatively impact cash flows and not decline as quickly or at the same rate as revenues when circumstances might cause a reduction at our properties

the shortterm nature of apartment leases expose us more quickly to the effects of declining market rents potentially making our revenue more volatile 

generally our residential apartment leases are for twelve months or less if the terms of the renewal or reletting are less favorable than current terms then the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected given our generally shorter term lease structure our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms

 

the geographic concentration of our properties could have an adverse effect on our operations 

the company’s properties are highly concentrated in our primarily coastal markets if one or more of our markets is unfavorably impacted by specific economic conditions local real estate conditions increases in real estate and other taxes rent control or stabilization laws or localized environmental issues or naturalmanmade disasters the impact of such conditions may have a more negative impact on our results of operations than if our properties were more geographically diverse

additionally within its primarily coastal markets the company is highly concentrated in certain dense urban and suburban submarkets to the extent that these particular submarkets become less desirable to operate in including changes in multifamily housing supply and demand our results of operations could be more negatively impacted than if we were more diversified within our markets 

operations from new acquisitions development projects and renovations may fail to perform as expected

we intend to actively acquire develop and renovate multifamily operating properties as part of our business strategy newly acquired developed or renovated properties may not perform as we expect we may also overestimate the revenue or underestimate the expenses that a new or repositioned project may generate the occupancy rates and rents at these properties may fail to meet the expectations underlying our investment development and renovations in particular are subject to greater uncertainties and risks due to complexities and lead time in estimating costs we may underestimate the costs necessary to operate an acquired property to the standards established for its intended market position we may also underestimate the costs to complete a development property or to complete a renovation 

competition for acquisitions may prevent us from acquiring properties on favorable terms

we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition and development opportunities we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions we may be unable to consummate such dispositions in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all in some cases we may also determine that we will not recover the carrying amount of the property upon disposition this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could negatively affect our financial condition including our ability to make distributions to our security holders

the company’s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and writedown the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize material asset impairment charges in the future these charges could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

construction risks on our development projects could affect our profitability

we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties as part of our business strategy development often includes long planning and entitlement timelines subjecting the project to changes in market conditions it can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in our markets we may also experience an increase in costs due to general disruptions that affect the cost of labor andor materials such as trade disputes tariffs labor unrest andor geopolitical conflicts we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons and as a result we may fail to recover expenses or option payments already incurred in exploring those opportunities we may also be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and 

 

authorizations these and other risks inherent in development projects could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities 

we are subject to risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures

we currently and may continue to in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities joint ventures create risks including the following 









at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners we also have in the past and could choose in the future to guarantee part of or all of certain joint venture debt we and our respective joint venture partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction  in some instances joint venture partners may also have competing interests or objectives that could create conflicts of interest similar to those noted above these objectives may be contrary to our compliance with the reit requirements and our reit status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with those requirements to the extent our partners do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures or they take actions inconsistent with the interests of the joint venture it could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition including distributions to our security holders

risks related to our financing strategy and capital structure 

disruptions in the financial markets could hinder our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions

dislocations and disruptions in capital markets could result in increased costs or lack of availability of debt financing including under our 10 billion commercial paper program and equity financing such events may affect our ability to refinance existing debt require us to utilize higher cost alternatives andor impair our ability to adjust to changing economic and business conditions capital market disruptions could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions or make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may unfavorably affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell such disruptions could cause the price of our securities to decline

our financial counterparties may not perform their obligations

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets or other events could impair the ability of our counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations to us there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to provide borrowings under our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to perform their obligations when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected

rising interest rates can increase costs

the company is exposed to market risk from financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates such risks derive from the refinancing of debt exposure to interest rate fluctuations in floating rate debt and from derivative instruments utilized to swap fixed rate debt to floating rates or to hedge rates in anticipation of future debt issuances increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and the costs of refinancing existing debt

insufficient cash flow could affect our ability to service existing debt and create refinancing risk

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments we may not be able to refinance existing debt and if we can the terms of such refinancing may be less favorable than the terms of existing indebtedness our inability to refinance extend or repay debt with proceeds from other capital market transactions would negatively impact our financial condition if the debt is secured the mortgage holder may also foreclose on the property 

 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the company’s revolving credit facility would cause the corresponding borrowing costs to increase impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and potentially impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders’ requirements at the lower ratings level

financial covenants could limit operational flexibility and affect our overall financial position

the terms of our credit agreements including our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued require us to comply with a number of financial covenants these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness and trigger a cross default of other debt

some of our properties are financed with taxexempt bonds or otherwise contain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions including affordability requirements which limit income from certain properties the company monitors compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit from financing properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities

we may change the dividend policy for our securities in the future   

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our securities as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends is at the discretion of the board of trustees and will depend on actual and projected financial conditions the company’s actual and projected liquidity and operating results the company’s projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities and such other factors as the company’s board of trustees deems relevant  the board of trustees may modify our dividend policy from time to time and any change in our dividend policy could negatively impact the market price of our securities

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could decrease the market price of our common shares

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile investors in our common shares consequently may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases due to this volatility and not necessarily related to our operating performance or prospects additionally the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to the sale of substantial amounts of our common shares or the anticipation of the sale of such shares by large holders of our securities the issuance of additional common shares by the company or the perception that such issuances might occur could also cause significant volatility and decreases in the value of our shares

issuances or sales of our common shares or units may be dilutive

any potential additional issuance of common shares or op units would reduce the percentage of our common shares and op units owned by investors in most circumstances shareholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common shares or units in addition depending on the terms and pricing of additional offerings of our common shares or units along with the value of our properties our shareholders and unitholders could experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common shares or units as well as dilution in our actual and expected earnings per share funds from operations “ffo” per share and normalized ffo per share

general risks

we depend on our key personnel

we depend on the efforts of our trustees and executive officers if one or more of them resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our business and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in our cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of our confidential information andor damage to our reputation and business relationships all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt payment collections and operations corrupt data or steal confidential information including information regarding our residents prospective residents employees and employees’ dependents 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures required employee awareness training and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems and systems maintained by third party vendors with which we do business are vulnerable to damage from any number of sources we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails phishing attempts or other scams persons inside our organization or personsvendors with access to our systems and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems including property infrastructure our information technology networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees and their dependents in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology security and other business services to us the systems of our third party service providers may contain defects in design or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise personally identifiable information although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology networks and those of our third party providers and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others a engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems b conducting periodic testing and verification of information and data security systems including performing ethical hacks of our systems to discover where any vulnerabilities may exist and c providing periodic employee awareness training around phishing and other scams malware and other cyber risks the company also has a cyber liability insurance policy to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches and data privacy regulations which provides a policy aggregate limit and a per occurrence deductible cyber liability insurance generally covers among other things costs associated with the wrongful release through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information however there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent a cyber incident or that our cyber liability insurance coverage will be sufficient in the event of a cyber incident

a breach or significant and extended disruption in the function of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose residents and revenues result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws generate third party claims result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personally identifiable and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers our insurers or any other responsible parties as a result there can be no assurance that our financial results would not be negatively impacted

litigation risk could affect our business

we may become involved in legal proceedings claims actions inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business these legal proceedings may include but are not limited to proceedings related to consumer shareholder securities employment environmental development condominium conversion tort eviction and commercial legal issues litigation can be lengthy and expensive and it can divert managements attention and resources results cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable outcome in litigation could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations

 

insurance policies can be costly and may not cover all losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s property general liability and workers compensation insurance policies provide coverage with substantial per occurrence deductibles andor selfinsured retentions these selfinsurance retentions can be a material portion of insurance losses in excess of the base deductibles while the company has previously purchased incremental insurance coverage in the event of multiple noncatastrophic occurrences within the same policy year these substantial deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses and this additional multiple occurrences coverage may not be available at all or on commercially reasonable terms in the future we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate however there are certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program as a result our financial results could be adversely affected and may vary significantly from period to period

the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability workers compensation and other insurance and should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact their ability to pay claims under the company’s policies 

earthquake risk  our policies insuring against earthquake losses have substantial deductibles which are applied to the values of the buildings involved in the loss with the geographic concentration of our properties a single earthquake affecting a market may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property or market as well as anticipated future revenue 

terrorism risk the company has terrorism insurance coverage which excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses 

catastrophic weather risk our properties may be located in areas that could experience catastrophic weather and other natural disasters from time to time including wildfires snow or ice storms windstorms or hurricanes flooding or other severe weather this severe weather and natural disasters could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which may not be covered or could exceed our insurance coverage exposure to this risk could also result in a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions 

climate change risk to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located we may experience severe weather which may result in physical damage to or decrease the demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature significant property damage or destruction of our properties could result in addition climate change could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties 

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the ownership limit described below in this item 1a while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have all of these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of the security holders

regulatory and tax risks

the adoption of or changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations and eviction laws and regulations in our markets could have an adverse effect on our operations and property values 

various state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations which could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees either of which could have a retroactive effect we continue to see increases in governments considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization 

 

laws and regulations these regulations may also make changes to eviction and other tenants’ rights laws and regulations that could have an adverse impact on our operations and property values i n june 2019 the state of new york enacted rent control regulations known as the housing stability and tenant protection act of 2019  in october 2019 the state of california enacted rent control regulations known as the tenant protection act of 2019   

compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs   

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements and federal state and local accessibility requirements including and in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing act noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance existing requirements could change and compliance with future requirements may require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

environmental problems are possible and can be costly

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require current or previous owners or operators of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances at such properties the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred third parties may also sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect the reporting of our operations

the company follows gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as authoritative for publicly held companies the fasb and the sec create and interpret accounting standards and may issue new accounting pronouncements or change the interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements  these changes could have a material impact on our reported consolidated results of operations and financial position

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could result in a decrease of our share price

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have a negative impact on our share price

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders

we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements for which there is limited judicial and administrative interpretation however are highly technical and complex therefore we cannot guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control to qualify as a reit our assets must be substantially comprised of real estate assets as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and related guidance and our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates including for years prior to 2018 any alternative minimum tax and would have to pay significant income taxes unless the internal revenue service “irs” granted us relief under certain statutory provisions in addition we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit we would therefore have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders and would no longer be required to make distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant negative impact on the value of our securities 

in addition certain of our subsidiary entities have elected to be taxed as reits as such each must separately satisfy all of the requirements to qualify for reit status if a subsidiary reit did not satisfy such requirements and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be taxed as a regular corporation and its income would be subject to us federal income taxation failure to comply with these complex reit rules at the subsidiary reit level can have a material and detrimental impact to eqr’s reit status

 

 

gain on disposition of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business is subject to 100 tax 

any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the irs may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties are prohibited transactions while we believe the irs would not prevail in any such dispute if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

we may be subject to legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition

at any time us federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be enacted or amended we cannot predict if or when any new us federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation or any amendment to any existing us federal income tax law irs and us department of treasury regulations or administrative guidance will be adopted or become effective and any such law regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively the company and our shareholders could be negatively impacted by any such change in or any new us federal income tax law regulations or administrative guidance

distribution requirements may limit our flexibility to manage our portfolio

in order to maintain qualification as a reit under the code a reit must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on amounts if any by which distributions we pay in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our net capital gains and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received we may incur a reduction in tax depreciation without a reduction in capital expenditures difficulties in meeting the 90 distribution requirement might arise due to competing demands for our funds or due to timing differences between tax reporting and cash distributions because deductions may be disallowed income may be reported before cash is received expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because the irs may make a determination that adjusts reported income in addition gain from the sale of property may exceed the amount of cash received on a leverageneutral basis a substantial increase to our taxable income may reduce the flexibility of the company to manage its portfolio through dispositions of properties other than through tax deferred transactions or cause the company to borrow funds or liquidate investments on unfavorable terms in order to meet these distribution requirements if we fail to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement we would cease to be taxed as a reit resulting in substantial taxrelated liabilities

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than five percent of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares the “ownership limit” absent an exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the company’s ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company or our shareholders

under certain circumstances we have made andor may consider making in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability

in order to retain liquidity and continue to satisfy the reit distribution requirements the company could issue shares rather than pay a dividend entirely in cash to shareholders the irs has published several rulings which have allowed reits to offer shareholders the choice between shares or cash as a form of payment of a dividend an “elective stock dividend” however reits 

 

are also permitted to limit the amount of cash paid to all shareholders to 20 of the total dividend paid therefore it is possible that the total tax burden to shareholders resulting from an elective stock dividend may exceed the amount of cash received by the shareholder 

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to reits prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving sam zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders

the consolidated properties acquired were located in the seattle new york denver and boston markets the consolidated properties disposed of were located in the seattle los angeles and new york markets and the sales generated an unlevered irr of 87 the consolidated properties development completions were located in the san francisco and washington dc markets finally the company started construction on one consolidated project located in the boston market consisting of 469 apartment units totaling approximately 4097 million of expected development costs 

see the definitions section below for the definition of acquisition cap rate development yield disposition yield and unlevered irr see also note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s real estate transactions

the company’s guidance assumes consolidated rental acquisitions of 125 billion and consolidated rental dispositions of 10 billion and the company expects that the acquisition cap rate will be 025 lower than the disposition yield for the full year ending december 31 2020 we currently budget spending approximately 3650 million on development costs during the year ending december 31 2020 inclusive of approximately 500 million of construction mortgage and joint venture partner obligations primarily for properties currently under construction 

same store results

properties that the company owned and were stabilized see definition below for all of both 2019 and 2018 the “2019 same store properties” which represented 71830 apartment units impacted the company’s results of operations the 2019 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs

the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less direct property operating expenses including real estate taxes and insurance the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment properties

 

the following tables provide a rollforward of the apartment units included in same store properties and a reconciliation of apartment units included in same store properties to those included in total properties for the year ended december 31 2019

the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2020 which assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking

 



 

 

the following table provides the actual same store revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018   and our expected full year same store revenue growth for 2020 

 



 

same store revenues for the full year of 2019 were slightly lower than our most recent expectations but still performed at the high end of our expectations from the beginning of the year revenue increased due to record low turnover strong occupancy and favorable overall demand the company’s primary focus in 2019 was on providing remarkable experiences for our residents which resulted in record levels of customer satisfaction and resident retention the company’s primary goals for 2020 will be to continue the 2019 trends while accelerating the deployment of various operating initiatives such as smart home technology and other sales and service related innovation improvements we expect consistent demand that should help with the absorption of the continued elevated supply that we expect in many of our markets 

 

new rent control regulations enacted in both the new york and california markets during 2019 are expected to negatively impact our overall same store revenue results by approximately 20 basis points for 2020 of the approximately 9600 apartment units located in our new york market approximately 3100 apartment units are rent stabilized primarily as a result of the 421a real estate tax abatement program and therefore more directly impacted by these new regulations once the abatement expires the apartment units can be brought to market rents and will no longer be subject to the rent control regulations we estimate that the new regulations will have a negative impact on renewal rates for some of these 3100 apartment units and will impact our ability to charge certain fees at all of our new york city properties approximately 6600 apartment units california’s new rent control regulations which became effective on january 1 2020 among other things limits the ability to raise rents on renewals to the local california consumer price index  5 on properties fifteen years or older it does not however impose such a cap upon vacancy of an apartment unit of our approximately 37600 apartment units located in california approximately 24400 are subject to these new regulations

 

boston performed better than expected with strong demand across the market strong occupancy new lease and renewal pricing increases drove our improved performance in 2019 however with competitive new supply pressures increasing in 2020 we anticipate consistent occupancy but less growth from renewals and new leases that will lead to lower anticipated overall same store revenue growth levels in 2020 

 

strong occupancy and pricing power continued to improve in new york as 2019 progressed this market however experienced some seasonal softness near yearend resulting in a concessionary environment that was greater than expected for 2020 while we continue to believe the new rent control regulations will have a modestly negative impact on our new york market results we expect overall same store revenue growth to improve from 2019 as pricing power returns to the market given the anticipated almost complete lack of competitive new supply additionally we expect slightly higher occupancy and renewal rates favorable market conditions and new lease growth in 2020 

 

washington dc continued to demonstrate strength in demand with strong occupancy renewal rates achieved and new lease change despite elevated supply in 2019 the economy particularly in northern virginia remains strong with gains in the professional and business services sector which are aiding in the absorption of new supply being delivered in 2020 we anticipate improved results mostly driven by stronger embedded growth starting the year and similar operating outcomes for occupancy new lease change and achieved renewal increase

 

the seattle market performed better than expected due to stronger than anticipated demand despite elevated new supply job growth continued to be very strong and we experienced the highest occupancy gains renewal rates achieved and new lease pricing of any of our markets in 2019 we expect to produce better same store revenue growth in 2020 with similar occupancy slight improvement to achieved renewal rates and the majority of growth coming from gains in new leases as we look to capitalize on the current and nearterm pricing power in the portfolio

 

 

san francisco performed slightly below our most recent expectations due to lower occupancy and elevated supply especially in the east bay impacting performance towards the end of 2019  while these trends are consistent with normal seasonal declines they were modestly more pronounced  in 2020 we expect similar new supply levels with the concentration of competitive supply impacting the downtown and south bay areas the most e xpected revenue growth in 2020 is lower compared to 2019 due to the impact of this new supply and the new rent control regulations w hile we expect some softness when new supply is concentrated around us t his market has a critical mass of technology talent and growth drivers for strong longterm performance  

 

while the los angeles market continued to maintain steady occupancy and solid renewal rates the market performed slightly below our expectations due to pricing power declines and negative new lease changes as new supply was delivered during the second half of 2019 we expect los angeles to be our most challenged market in 2020 due to elevated new supply implementation of the new rent control regulations and restrictions on shortterm lease pricing therefore we expect slightly lower occupancy modest gains in new lease change and a decline in renewal rate achieved growth 

 

in orange county results continued to be strong and in line with our expectations primarily due to high occupancy levels and inline renewal rate achieved and new lease change our properties performed well against competitive new supply during 2019 for 2020 we expect to deliver similar occupancy slight gains in new lease change and a decline in renewal rate achieved growth due to the impact of the new rent control regulations leading to expected 2020 results below 2019 with strong occupancy we believe that we are wellpositioned heading into a competitive environment

  

in san diego occupancy was better than expected but renewal rate achieved and new lease pricing were both lower than anticipated resulting in same store revenue slightly below our expectations overall military spending in this market remains strong but supply pressure limits our pricing power we expect to deliver strong but lower same store revenue growth in 2020 with similar occupancy slight gains in new lease change and a decline in renewal rate achieved growth based on the impact of the new rent control regulations with strong occupancy we believe that we are wellpositioned heading into a competitive environment

as of january 1 2019 the company had approximately 474 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately 689 million of restricted deposits and the available borrowing capacity on its revolving credit facility was 140 billion after the effect of the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities at december 31 2019 the company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was approximately 458 million the restricted deposits balance was approximately 712 million and the available borrowing capacity on its revolving credit facility was 138 billion see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the availability on the company’s revolving credit facility

during the year ended december 31 2019 the company generated proceeds from various transactions which included the following 











during the year ended december 31 2019 the above proceeds along with net cash flow from operations and borrowings from the company’s revolving line of credit and commercial paper program were primarily utilized to









 

credit facility and commercial paper program 

the company has a 25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing november 1 2024 the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 7500 million by adding lenders to the facility obtaining the agreement of existing lenders to increase their commitments or incurring one or more term loans the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be libor plus a spread currently 0775 or based on bids received from the lending group and the company pays a quarterly facility fee currently 0125 both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the company’s senior unsecured credit rating

the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains provisions that establish a process for entering into an amendment to replace libor under certain circumstances such as the anticipated phaseout of libor by the end of 2021 at this time it cannot be determined what interest rates may succeed libor if any and how any successor or alternative rates for libor may affect borrowing costs or the availability of variable interest rate borrowings

the company has an unsecured commercial paper note program in the united states the company may borrow up to a maximum of 10 billion under this program subject to market conditions the notes will be sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness 

the company limits its utilization of the revolving credit facility in order to maintain liquidity to support its 10 billion commercial paper program along with certain other obligations the following table presents the availability on the company’s unsecured revolving credit facility as of february 14 2020 amounts in thousands

 



 

dividend policy

the company determines its dividendsdistributions based on actual and projected financial conditions the company’s actual and projected liquidity and operating results the company’s projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities and such other factors as the company’s board of trustees deems relevant the company declared a dividenddistribution for each quarter in 2019 of 05675 per shareunit an annualized increase of 51 over the amount paid in 2018 this increase is supported by the company’s strong growth in property operations and a significant reduction in its development activity resulting in a material increase in available cash flow the company’s 2019 operating cash flow was sufficient to cover capital expenditures and regular dividendsdistributions 

the company expects to declare a dividenddistribution of 06025 per shareunit for the first quarter of 2020 an annualized increase of 62 over the amount paid in 2019 this increase is driven by the company’s continued strong cash flow performance solid balance sheet and modest payout ratio the company believes that its expected 2020 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and regular dividendsdistributions all future dividendsdistributions remain subject to the discretion of the company’s board of trustees 

total dividendsdistributions paid in january 2020 amounted to 2183 million excluding distributions on partially owned properties which consisted of certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2019

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in three major categories and several subcategories





 









all replacements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above

















all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects may be restricted by other thresholds ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset

the third major category is renovations which primarily consists of expenditures for kitchens and baths designed to reposition the apartment unitsproperties for higher rental levels in their respective markets all renovation expenditures are depreciated over a tenyear estimated useful life

for the year ended december 31 2019 our actual capital expenditures to real estate included the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts

the company estimates that during 2020 it will spend approxima tely 2600 per same store apartment unit or 1950 million of total capital expenditures to real estate for same store properties included in these total expected expenditures are approximately 500 million for apartment unit renovation expenditures on approximately 2500 same store apartment units at an average cost of approximately 20000 per apartment unit renovated and approximately 100 million on smart home technology upgrades on approximately 10000 same store apartment units at an average cost of approximately 1000 per apartment unit the anticipated total capital expenditures to real estate for same store properties represent a higher absolute and per unit dollar amount and percentage of same store revenues as compared to 2019 primarily due to the higher expected renovation expenditures and smart home technology upgrades 

during the year ended december 31 2019 the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 50 million the company expects to fund approximately 227 million in total nonreal estate capital additions in 2020 these anticipated fundings are significantly higher than 2019 and are primarily driven by corporate office renovations during 2020 

derivative instruments

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2019

the company has identified the significant accounting policies below as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented

impairment of longlived assets

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investment in real estate for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions legal regulatory and environmental concerns the company’s intent and ability to hold the related asset as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted assessing impairment can be complex and involves a high degree of subjectivity in determining if indicators are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or the fair value of an asset in particular these estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions including the estimation of future rental revenues operating expenses discount and capitalization rates and our intent and ability to hold the related asset all of which could be affected by our expectations about future market or economic conditions these estimates can have a significant impact on the undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset

acquisition of investment properties

the company allocates the purchase price of properties that meet the definition of an asset acquisition to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their relative fair values in making estimates of relative fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company is exposed to market risk from financial instruments primarily from changes in interest rates such risks derive from the refinancing of debt maturities from exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt and from derivative instruments utilized to swap fixed rate debt to floating or to hedge rates in anticipation of future debt issuances our operating results are therefore affected by changes in shortterm interest rates primarily london interbank offered rate “libor” and securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” indices which directly impact borrowings under our revolving credit facility and interest on secured and unsecured borrowings contractually tied to such rates shortterm interest rates also indirectly affect the discount on notes issued under our commercial paper program additionally we have exposure to longterm interest rates particularly us treasuries as they are utilized to price our long term borrowings and therefore affect the cost of refinancing existing debt or incurring additional debt

the company monitors and manages interest rates as part of its risk management process by targeting adequate levels of floating rate exposure and an appropriate debt maturity profile from time to time we may utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure and to comply with the requirements of certain lenders but not for trading or speculative purposes see also note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments

the company had total variable rate debt of 14 billion representing 153 of total debt and 14 billion representing 164 of total debt as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher in 2019 and 2018 and average balances coincided with year end balances our annual interest expense would have been 138 million and 145 million higher respectively unsecured notes issued under the company’s commercial paper program are treated as variable rate debt for the purposes of this calculation even though they do not have a stated interest rate given their shortterm nature the effect of derivatives if applicable is also considered when computing the total amount of variable rate debt

changes in interest rates also affect the estimated fair market value of our fixed rate debt computed using a discounted cash flow model as of december 31 2019 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of 77 billion or 847 of total debt with an estimated fair market value of 82 billion if interest rates had been 100 basis points lower as of december 31 2019 the estimated fair market value would have increased by approximately 6644 million as of december 31 2018 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of 74 billion or 836 of total debt with an estimated fair market value of 74 billion if interest rates had been 100 basis points lower as of december 31 2018 the estimated fair market value would have increased by approximately 5143 million

 

the company had no outstanding derivative instruments as of december 31 2019 and had derivative instruments with a net liability fair value of approximately 101 million as of december 31 2018 if interest rates had been 27 basis points representing 10 of the weighted average of the then prevailing market rates lower on december 31 2018 the liability would have increased by approximately 113 million  

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to these changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations and appreciation we are focused primarily on the urban and highdensity suburban areas of boston new york washington dc southern california including los angeles orange county and san diego san francisco seattle and denver these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents











 

we believe our strategy also capitalizes on the increasing preference of renters of all ages to live in the urban core of cities or dense suburban locations near transit entertainment and cultural amenities millennials the approximately 78 million people born between 1981 and 2000 are a prime apartment rental demographic we also expect this demographic to remain renters longer due to societal trends favoring delayed marriage and smaller family sizes reports also show a growing trend among aging baby boomers a demographic of more than 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964 toward apartment rentals we believe that both groups appreciate the locational values described above as well as the flexibility that rental apartments offer 

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal and app which allows them to sign and renew their leases review their accounts and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online or with mobile devices

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture arrangements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include op units as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales 

as part of its strategy the company purchases apartment properties at various stages of occupancy and completion and may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell as well as options to buy more land in the future the company may also seek to acquire properties by providing mezzanine financingequity andor purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio into urban and highly walkable closein suburban assets since 2005 the company has sold approximately 200000 apartment units primarily located in markets and submarkets it believes will have less attractive longterm returns for an aggregate sales price of approximately 246 billion acquired approximately 71000 apartment units primarily located in the urban and highdensity suburban areas noted above for approximately 212 billion and began approximately 63 billion of development projects primarily located in the urban and highdensity suburban areas noted above in 2018 the company began to actively invest in rental properties in urban and highdensity suburban areas of denver a market that shares many characteristics with the company’s other markets

starwood transaction

the company executed an agreement with controlled affiliates of starwood capital group “starwood” on october 23 2015 to sell a portfolio of 72 operating properties consisting of 23262 apartment units located in five markets across the united states for 5365 billion the “starwood transaction” or “starwood portfolio” on january 26 and 27 2016 the company closed on the sale of the entire portfolio described above the sale of the starwood portfolio combined with the other 2016 dispositions at that time resulted in the company’s exit from the south florida denver primarily suburban portfolio and new england excluding boston markets and substantially completed the company’s portfolio transformation which started over ten years ago 

the company used the majority of the proceeds from the starwood transaction and other 2016 dispositions to pay two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of op units of 1100 per shareunit in the aggregate consisting of special dividends of 800 per shareunit approximately 30 billion on march 10 2016 and 300 per shareunit approximately 11 billion on october 14 2016 the company used the majority of the remaining proceeds to reduce aggregate indebtedness in order to make the transaction leverage neutral the company retired approximately 20 billion in secured and unsecured debt the majority of which was scheduled to mature in 2016 and 2017 which improved the company’s already strong credit metrics 

competition

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors  for additional information with respect to competition

environmental considerations

see item 1a risk factors  for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations




 item 1a risk factors

general

this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units op units restricted 

 

units and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own such securities as our “security holders” 

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry

general

numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value these factors include changes in the global national regional and local political and economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes both as rentals and owned housing and changes in market rental rates additionally our business and the value of our properties can be negatively impacted by the failure of governments to invest in infrastructure or the possibility of poordeclining fiscal health of the governments where we do business 

our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes all of which could increase over time besides utilities we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any other operating expenses including real estate taxes and onsite payroll these operating expenses could rise faster than our revenues causing our income to decline in circumstances where we buy or sell properties including large portfolios of properties overhead property management expense and general and administrative expense may not increasedecrease proportionally with the associated changes in revenue costs of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire

when our residents decide to leave our apartments we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local political economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and owned housingcondominiums increasing portions of owned housingcondominium stock being converted to rental use rental housing subsidized by the government other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing slow or negative employment growth and household formation the availability of lowinterest mortgages or the availability of mortgages requiring little or no down payment for single family home buyers changes in social preferences governmental regulations including rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond our control finally government policies many of which may encourage home ownership can increase competition possibly limiting our ability to raise rents in our markets and lowering the value of our properties consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced

changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations and eviction laws and regulations in our markets could have an adverse effect on our operations and property values 

various state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees such as pet fees or application fees we have seen a recent increase in governments considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations depending on the extent and terms of future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such issues such future enactments could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and the value of our properties 

 

state and local governments may also make changes to eviction and other tenants’ rights laws and regulations that could have an adverse impact on our operations and property values under current laws and regulations eviction proceedings for delinquent residents are already costly and timeconsuming especially in markets like new york where housing courts are backlogged if we are restricted from releasing apartment units due to the inability to evict delinquent residents our results of operations and property values may be adversely impacted 

concentration of properties in our primarily urban and highdensity suburban markets could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely affected by economic or other conditions

the company is highly concentrated in its primarily urban and highdensity suburban markets if any one or more of these markets is adversely affected by local or regional economic conditions such as business layoffs industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors local real estate conditions such as oversupply of or reduced demand for multifamily properties increases in real estate and other taxes rent control or stabilization laws or localized environmental issues or natural disasters such conditions may have an increased adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio were more geographically diverse

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions we may be unable to consummate such dispositions in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all in some cases we may also determine that we will not recover the carrying amount of the property upon disposition which could also lead to an impairment charge this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders

new acquisitions development projects andor renovations may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties that we would like to acquire

we intend to actively acquire develop and renovate multifamily operating properties as market conditions dictate we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of leaseup we may be unable to lease these apartment properties on schedule resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues andor lower yields due to lower occupancy and rental rates as well as higher than expected concessions or higher than expected operating expenses we may not be able to achieve rents that are consistent with expectations for acquired developed or renovated properties we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position to complete a development property or to complete a renovation additionally we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts this competition or lack thereof may increase or depress prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties including large portfolios of properties that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure the total number of apartment units under development costs of labor and construction materials and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions competition tariffs and other trade disruptions and local government regulation

development and construction risks could affect our profitability

we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in our markets we may experience an increase in costs associated with trade disruptions and tariffs we may abandon opportunities including land that we have optioned for purchase that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs and as a result we may fail to recover expenses or option payments already incurred in exploring those opportunities the occupancy rates and rents at a property may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing properties we may be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities and impairment charges 

we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space

the retailcommercial space including parking garages at our properties primarily serves as an additional amenity for our residents and neighbors the longterm nature of our retailcommercial leases generally five to ten years with market based renewal options and the characteristics of many of our retailcommercial tenants generally small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances 

 

and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition the revenues from our retailcommercial space represent approximately 4 0 of our total rental income 

we own certain properties subject to ground leases that may limit our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us terminated or lapse

the company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under several longterm ground leases these ground leases may impose limitations on our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable residents for the properties in addition we could lose our interests in the properties if the ground leases are breached by us terminated or lapse as we get closer to the lease termination dates the values of the properties could decrease without an extension in place certain of these ground leases have payments subject to annual escalations andor periodic fair market value adjustments which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority regarding major decisions our reliance on our joint venture partners’ financial condition any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners

we currently do and may continue in the future to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures we have several joint ventures with other real estate investors joint venture investments involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties including the following

















at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners we also have in the past and could choose in the future to guarantee part of or all of certain joint venture debt frequently we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners’ interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate and recognize attractive returns on our joint venture investments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and distributions to our shareholders

 

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including but not limited to the following





























issuances or sales of our common shares may be dilutive

the issuance or sale of substantial amounts of our common shares whether directly by us or in the secondary market the perception that such issuances or sales of our common shares could occur or the availability for future issuance or sale of our common shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common shares could have a dilutive effect on our actual and expected earnings per share ffo per share and normalized ffo per share the actual amount of dilution cannot be determined at this time and would be dependent upon numerous factors which are not currently known to us

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of regular distributions to our security holders however whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels 

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect the reporting of our operations

the company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the fasb and the sec create and interpret accounting standards and may issue new accounting pronouncements or change the interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements  these changes could have a material impact on our reported consolidated results of operations and financial position

 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in our cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of our confidential information andor damage to our reputation and business relationships all of which could negatively impact our financial results

a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt payment collections and operations corrupt data or steal confidential information including information regarding our residents prospective residents employees and employees’ dependents 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures required employee awareness training and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems and systems maintained by third party vendors with which we do business are vulnerable to damage from any number of sources we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails phishing attempts or other scams persons inside our organization or personsvendors with access to our systems and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems including property infrastructure our information technology networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees and their dependents in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us our third party service providers may contain defects in design or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise personally indentifiable information although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information technology networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others a engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems b conducting periodic testing and verification of information and data security systems including performing ethical hacks of our systems to discover where any vulnerabilities may exist and c providing periodic employee awareness training around phishing and other scams malware and other cyber risks we also maintain cyber liability insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches see further discussion on cyber liability insurance below however there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent a cyber incident or that our cyber liability insurance coverage will be sufficient in the event of a cyber incident

a breach or significant and extended disruption in the function of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose residents and revenues generate third party claims result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personally identifiable and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses such as remediation costs litigation and legal costs and additional cybersecurity protection costs to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers our insurers or any other responsible parties as a result there can be no assurance that our financial results would not be adversely impacted 

litigation risk could affect our business

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer shareholder securities employment environmental development condominium conversion tort eviction and commercial legal issues any of which could result in a class action lawsuit that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations additionally we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in 

 

compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future

we are aware that some of our properties have preexisting building materials such as lead paint or asbestos and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those properties while we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of these preexisting building materials there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future

there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property should mold become an issue in the future our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties

insurance policies can be costly and may not cover all losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

the company’s property insurance general liability and workers compensation insurance policies provide coverage with substantial per occurrence deductibles andor selfinsured retentions the company typically selfinsures a substantial portion of insurance losses in excess of the base deductibles in addition earthquake losses have substantial deductibles which are applied to the values of the buildings involved in the loss while the company has previously purchased additional insurance coverage in the event it suffers multiple noncatastrophic occurrences within the same policy year these substantial deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses and this additional coverage may not be available or commercially reasonable in the future the company also has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio becoming more concentrated in fewer more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint 

the company has terrorism insurance coverage which excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses

the company also has a cyber liability insurance policy which provides a policy aggregate limit and a per occurrence deductible cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers this cyber policy would cover costs such as victim notification credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses

the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability and workers compensation insurance while there has yet to be any nonperformance by these major insurance providers should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact the company in addition the company annually assesses its insurance needs based on the cost of coverage and other factors we may choose to selfinsure a greater portion of this risk in the future or may choose to have higher deductibles or lesser policy terms

 

damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events and climate change could result in losses to the company 

certain of our properties are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including fires snow or ice storms windstorms or hurricanes earthquakes flooding or other severe weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage and may result in a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions furthermore the potential impact of climate change increased severe weather or earthquakes could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future revenue from that property we could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations

in addition changes in government legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our development properties without a corresponding increase in revenues 

nonperformance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance

we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties as a result defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided or volatility in the financial markets could affect counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations

debt financing could adversely affect our performance

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions

dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly andor to decline

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance

through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac the “government sponsored enterprises” or “gses” are significant lenders and enhancers of taxexempt bonds both to the company and to buyers of the company’s properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have an impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our secured borrowings disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit market’s perception of the gses which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on our taxexempt debt obligations these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets

nonperformance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress

 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the revolving credit facility impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders’ requirements at the lower ratings level

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

  financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition 

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our revolving credit facility and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 should it fall out of compliance it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds or otherwise contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions including affordability requirements the company and from time to time its consultants monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing

our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general

rising interest rates could adversely affect our operations and cash flows

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to the refinancing of its longterm debt and floating interest rate instruments that include its unsecured revolving credit facility commercial paper program floating rate taxexempt debt and fair value hedges that convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt these exposures to interest rates are primarily driven by changes in longterm us treasury rates for refinancing activity changes in shortterm london interbank offered rate “libor” borrowing rates and the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” index for floating rate debt and changes in commercial paper market conditions increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect our operations and cash flows and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders

 

derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow 

in the normal course of business we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments including hedging for future debt issuances at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates we may also use derivatives to manage commodity prices in the daily operations of our business there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact these arrangements which can include a number of counterparties may expose us to additional risks including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts and may involve extensive costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate or commodity pricing fluctuations

the phaseout of libor and transition to sofr as a benchmark interest rate could have adverse effects

in 2018 the alternative reference rate committee identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities published by the federal reserve bank of new york by the end of 2021 it is expected that no new contracts will reference libor and will instead use sofr due to the broad use of libor as a reference rate all financial market participants including the company are impacted by the risks associated with this transition and therefore it could adversely affect our operations and cash flows

we depend on our key personnel

we depend on the efforts of our trustees and executive officers if one or more of them resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our business and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the ownership limit described below while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the company’s ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit we have issued several of these waivers in the past

our preferred shares may affect changes in control

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders

 

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to reits prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders

our status as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements in addition certain of our subsidiary entities have elected to be taxed as reits as such each must separately satisfy all of the requirements to qualify for reit status our failure to comply with the complex reit rules at the subsidiary reit level can materially and adversely impact eqr’s reit status

even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status however the reit qualification rules permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status there is also risk that congress and the internal revenue service “irs” might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income

the tax act is complex and remains subject to interpretations

on december 22 2017 the president signed into law hr 1 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” with most provisions having an initial effective date of january 1 2018 the tax act made significant changes to the internal revenue code as amended the “code” changes made by the tax act that may affect the taxation of reits and their security holders include among other things a permanent reduction in corporate tax rates and elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax b temporary reduction in individual tax rates c enactment of a deduction of up to 20 of certain passthrough business income and reit dividends excluding capital gain and qualified dividends received by individuals estates and trusts and d limitation of the net operating loss deduction to 80 of reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction in addition the tax act generally limits the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30 of a business’s adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers engaged in certain real estate businesses including equity reits that elect out of this rule provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system with longer depreciation periods

 

 

as of december 31 2018 the tax act did not have a material impact on our reit or subsidiary entities the size and character of our dividends our ability to continue to qualify as a reit or on our results of operations in addition the tax act is expected to have a favorable impact on the effective tax rate of our shareholders and our residents however the complete impact of the tax act remains unclear and there can be no assurances that it will have a neutral or favorable impact technical corrections or other amendments to the tax act as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the irs and the us department of the treasury that may prospectively or retroactively modify tax treatment may be forthcoming at any time prospective and current shareholders should consult with their tax advisors with respect to the effect of the tax act and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on your investment 

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of the merger with us if that were the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are disposed of within ten years of the merger

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition and our shareholders’ liquidity

distribution requirements may limit our flexibility to manage our portfolio

in order to maintain qualification as a reit under the code the reit must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received we may incur a reduction in tax depreciation without a reduction in capital expenditures provisions of the tax act may require that we depreciate existing assets over a longer useful life which may substantially increase our taxable income in addition gain from the sale of property may exceed the amount of cash received on a leverageneutral basis a substantial increase to our taxable income may reduce the flexibility of the company to manage its portfolio through dispositions of properties in non1031 exchange transactions or cause the company to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements if we fail to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement we would cease to be taxed as a reit resulting in substantial taxrelated liabilities

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company or our shareholders

under certain circumstances we have made andor may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability

the irs has published several rulings that allow reits to offer shareholders the choice of stock or cash with respect to the receipt of a dividend an “elective stock dividend” however reits are also permitted to limit the amount of cash paid to all shareholders to 20 of the total dividend paid therefore it is possible that the total tax burden to shareholders resulting from an elective stock dividend may exceed the amount of cash received by the shareholder

federal income tax considerations

general

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flowthrough entity for federal income tax purposes

 

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

the information in this section is based on the current code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the code current administrative interpretations and practices of the irs including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the irs and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the irs could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the irs or the courts and that a court could agree with the irs

our taxation

we elected reit status beginning with the tax year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary “trs” status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries engaged in activities which cannot be performed directly by a reit such as condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income generated by these activities in our trss

our qualification and taxation as a reit depends on our ability to satisfy various requirements under highly technical and complex provisions of the code these requirements must be satisfied on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit

failure to qualify as a reit andor failure to meet certain reit requirements would result in the following adverse tax consequences

















we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the code for a particular year

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce 

 

the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a trs provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 20 of the reit’s total asset value trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a trs may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation further the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 





to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a trs we believe that services provided to residents by us do not generally result in substantial impermissible tenant services income and will not when considered together with all of our gross receipts cause us to fail to satisfy the reit gross income tests however we cannot provide any assurance that the irs will agree with these positions

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit

 

asset tests  in general on the last day of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets 











the 10 value test described in clause 3b above does not apply to nonqualified publicly offered reit debt instruments or to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer’s debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the irs will agree with our determinations

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the irs if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies consequently the operating partnership’s assets and operations may affect our ability to qualify as a reit 

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above and any changes in the federal tax code may not be adopted by the states potentially leading to material tax liabilities for the company and its shareholders in addition state and local taxing jurisdictions may adopt new legislation or tax regimes which could significantly impact our tax liabilities or require the company to withhold taxes from shareholders consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to trss will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december with a record date in such month are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit’s earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distributions paid in january exceed available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years

a reit may make an election under the code to treat certain dividends that are paid in a taxable year as being made by the reit in the previous taxable year a shareholder is required to include the amount of the dividend in the taxable year that it is paid by the reit

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year or the amount of distributions treated as dividends for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income

generally our designated capital gain dividends will be broken out into net capital gains distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20 for individual taxpayers in the highest tax bracket and unrecaptured section 1250 gain distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25

certain us shareholders that are taxed as individuals estates or trusts may also be required to pay an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of 

 

common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares 

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between





the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the code in addition certain provisions of the tax act may impact a taxexempt shareholder’s calculation of ubti these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the impact of the tax act and their federal income tax obligations

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule

taxation of foreign shareholders

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than







 

distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless





if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless





under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder other than certain qualified shareholders and qualified foreign pension funds discussed below that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 21 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition if timely requested foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability

 

foreign shareholders’ sales of common shares gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 





even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if





if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 15 of the purchase price

exception to firpta for qualified shareholders for dispositions and distributions after december 18 2015 stock of a reit held directly or through partnerships by a “qualified shareholder” will not be treated as united states real property interest and capital gain dividends from such a reit will not be treated as gain from the sale of a united states real property interest this exception does not apply to persons that hold an interest taking into account applicable constructive ownership rules more than 10 of the stock of the reit unless that interest is solely as a creditor an “applicable investor” if the qualified shareholder has such an “applicable investor” the portion of reit stock indirectly owned through the qualified shareholder by the applicable investor will be treated as gains from the sale of united states real property interests for these purposes a “qualified shareholder” is a foreign person which is in a treaty jurisdiction and satisfies certain publicly traded requirements is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” and maintains records on the identity of certain 5 owners a “qualified collective investment vehicle” is a foreign person that is eligible for a reduced withholding rate with respect to ordinary reit dividends even if such person holds more than 10 of the reit’s stock a publicly traded partnership that is a withholding foreign partnership that would be a united states real property holding corporation if it were a united states corporation or is designated as a qualified collective investment vehicle by the secretary of the treasury and is either fiscally transparent within the meaning of the code or required to include dividends in its gross income but entitled to a deduction for distribution to its investors finally capital gain dividends and nondividend redemption and liquidating distributions to a qualified shareholder that are not allocable to an applicable investor will be treated as ordinary dividends 

 

exception to firpta withholding for qualified foreign pension funds for distributions or dispositions of reit stock after december 18 2015 “qualified foreign pension funds” and entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund are exempted from firpta withholding for these purposes a “qualified foreign pension fund” is any trust corporation or other organization or arrangement if i it was created or organized under foreign law ii it was established to provide retirement or pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees of one or more employers in consideration for services rendered iii it does not have a single participant or beneficiary with a right to more than 5 of its assets or income iv it is subject to government regulation and provides annual information reporting about its beneficiaries to the relevant tax authorities in the country in which it is established or operates and v under the laws of the country in which it is established or operates either contributions to such fund which would otherwise be subject to tax under such laws are deductible or excluded from the gross income of such fund or taxed at a reduced rate or taxation of any investment income of such fund is deferred or such income is taxed at a reduced rate 

 

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the irs the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the irs backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the irs

withholding on foreign financial institutions and nonus shareholders

the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” imposes a us withholding tax at a 30 rate on dividends and on proceeds from the sale of our shares paid beginning january 1 2019 to “foreign financial institutions” as defined under fatca and certain other foreign entities if certain due diligence and disclosure requirements related to us accounts with or ownership of such entities are not satisfied or an exemption does not apply if fatca withholding is imposed nonus beneficial owners that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from or a reduction of us withholding tax with respect to such distributions and sale proceeds would be required to seek a refund from the irs to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction any payment made by us that is subject to withholding under fatca or otherwise will be net of the amount required to be withheld

same store results

properties that the company owned and were stabilized see definition below for all of both 2018 and 2017 the “2018 same store properties” which represented 71721 apartment units impacted the company’s results of operations the 2018 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs

the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less direct property operating expenses including real estate taxes and insurance the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment properties

 

the following tables provide a rollforward of the apartment units included in same store properties and a reconciliation of apartment units included in same store properties to those included in total properties for the year ended december 31 2018 

 



 



 

note properties are considered “stabilized” when they have achieved 90 occupancy for three consecutive months properties are included in same store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented

 

note during the year ended december 31 2018 the company closed down a garage crp sports garage in boston massachusetts and began its demolition as it starts the development of west end tower on the site as a result the garage was removed from the same store portfolio which had no impact on the apartment unit or property count for the year ended december 31 2018

the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2019 which assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

 



 

same store revenues increased 23 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was ahead of our original expectations and consistent with our most recent guidance that was provided in october 2018 due to gains in occupancy of 02 continued low turnover and strong renewals the company’s primary goal in 2018 was to focus on providing exceptional customer service in order to retain existing residents to drive strong occupancy and renewal rate growth which it achieved at 49 for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 same store turnover declined by 23 for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 the company’s primary focus for 2019 will continue to be retaining existing residents and maintaining strong occupancy additionally in many markets we expect to achieve improved new lease growth albeit only modestly better relative to 2018 we currently estimate same store revenues to increase in a range from 22 to 32 for 2019 as compared to 2018 our outlook for 2019 is based on an expectation that continued economic growth will create the demand to absorb the elevated levels of new supply in many of our markets all of our markets with the exception of seattle and orange county are projected to deliver better same store revenue growth in 2019 as compared to 2018 

 

washington dc showed above average job growth at the end of 2018 which aided the absorption of elevated new supply and occupancy rates remained high throughout the year however same store revenues increased 10 during the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 which was consistent with our original expectations but slightly below our most recent guidance that was provided in october 2018 in 2019 we expect to see a slight decline in occupancy rates and consistent new lease and renewal rates we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 14 in this market in 2019 this expected 040 improvement over 2018 is almost entirely driven by growth already in place from existing residents given less ability to raise rents due to elevated levels of supply

 

in the new york market we anticipated that elevated deliveries of new luxury supply would have an impact on our ability to raise rents and would require us to issue meaningful rent concessions while we were impacted by new supply stronger demand for our properties led to increased same store occupancy levels and significantly fewer rent concessions for the year ended december 31 2018 than we expected as a result same store revenues increased 08 for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was higher than both our original expectations and our most recent guidance that was provided in october 2018 with new competitive supply expected to be lower in 2019 similar occupancy rates strong renewal and new lease rates and continued strong demand anticipated in the market we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 18 in this market in 2019

 

boston continues to steadily absorb new supply as a result of strong job growth in the biotechnology and business sectors same store revenues increased 25 for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was higher than our original guidance and slightly higher than our most recent guidance provided in october 2018  due to stronger occupancy rates and renewal increases with supply pressures easing in the nearterm  we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 28 in this market in 2019

 

we have a continued cautious outlook for seattle as the market has decelerated as anticipated due to significant supply in the urban core same store revenues increased 28 for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was below both our original expectations and our most recent guidance provided in october 2018 job growth is expected to be strong in 2019 and w e expect a slight improvement in occupancy and new lease rates offset by lower renewal rate growth we also expect new supply to remain elevated in this market in 2019 we therefore expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 20 in this market in 2019

 

san francisco continues to perform better than expected as a result of solid job growth and strong demand driving occupancy new lease growth and renewal rates the market showed positive trends and is producing wage growth driven by technology company expansions and investments as a result same store revenues increased 29 for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was above our original expectations and consistent with our most recent guidance provided in october 2018 in 2019 we expect the elevated supply levels to continue to be absorbed due to economic and job expansion in this market we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 34 in this market in 2019 

 

 

los angeles continues to experience new supply but the impact of this supply has been somewhat delayed due to labor shortages pushing deliveries of new units into 2019 strong demand and to some extent these delays in deliveries have led to occupancy renewals and new lease rates that exceeded our original expectations same store revenues increased 36  for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was above our original expectations and consistent with our most recent guidance provided in october 2018   we believe job growth will continue to be strong and absorb the incoming new supply in 2019 we therefore expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 38 in this market in 2019 

 

during the first half of the year orange county experienced pressure on average rental rates and occupancy due to elevated supply within the irvine area which was offset by strong renewal rates same store revenues increased 35 f or the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was below our original expectations and slightly below our most recent guidance provided in october 2018 job growth has been slowing in this market but the overall outlook for 2019 remains positive we believe renewal increases will be slightly lower and therefore expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 31 in this market in 2019

  

in the san diego market we experienced supply pressure in the downtown area but military spending remains strong same store revenues increased 39 f or the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was slightly below both our original expectations and our most recent guidance provided in october 2018 we believe occupancy and new lease rates will remain similar in 2019 we therefore expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 39 in this market in 2019

 

during the second half of 2018 the company acquired two apartment properties in denver while these properties are not currently within our same store portfolio these properties are performing consistent with our expectations

same store expenses increased 36 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was near the low end of our original expectations and slightly lower than our most recent guidance provided in october 2018 the full year 2018 results were primarily due to the following items  

 



 



 



 



 

we anticipate same store expenses to increase in a range from 35 to 45 for 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to the following items

 



 



 



 

same store noi increased 17 for the full year 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was higher than our original expectations and consistent with our most recent guidance provided in october 2018 the company anticipates same store noi growth of approximately 15 to 30 for the full year 2019 as a result of the above same store revenue and expense expectations

nonsame storeother results

 

nonsame storeother noi results for the year ended december 31 2018 increased approximately 331 million compared to the same period of 2017 and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2017 and 2018 operations from the company’s development properties and operations prior to disposition from 2017 and 2018 sold properties this difference is due primarily to

 







 



the company’s guidance assumes consolidated rental acquisitions of 7000 million and consolidated rental dispositions of 7000 million and assumes that the acquisition cap rate will be 025 lower than the disposition yield for the full year ending december 31 2019 the company did not budget any development starts during the year ending december 31 2019 we currently 

 

budget spending approximately 1 65  0 million on development costs during the year ending december 31 2019 primarily for projects currently under construction we assume that this capital will be primarily sourced with excess operating cash flow future debt offerings and borrowings on our revolving credit facility andor commercial paper program these 2019 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2018 to the year ended december 31 2017 and the year ended december 31 2017 to the year ended december 31 2016

for the year ended december 31 2018 the company reported diluted earnings per shareunit of 177 compared to 163 per shareunit for the year ended december 31 2017 the difference is primarily due to approximately 026 per shareunit in higher gains on property sales and 016 per shareunit in higher property noi in 2018 as compared to 2017 partially offset by 008 per shareunit in higher debt extinguishment costs 005 per shareunit in lower gains on sales of nonoperating assets and 011 per shareunit in higher depreciation expense in 2018 compared to 2017 for the year ended december 31 2017 the company reported diluted earnings per shareunit of 163 compared to 1168 per shareunit for the year ended december 31 2016 the difference is primarily due to approximately 1016 per shareunit in higher gains on property sales and 014 per shareunit in higher gains on sales of nonoperating assets in 2016 compared to 2017 as a direct result of the significant sales activity in 2016 compared to 2017 partially offset by 029 per shareunit in higher debt extinguishment costs incurred in 2016 as compared to 2017

 

for the year ended december 31 2018 consolidated rental income increased 43 consolidated operating expenses comprised of property and maintenance and real estate taxes and insurance increased 63 and consolidated noi increased 35 when compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase in noi is primarily a result of the company’s improved noi from same store and leaseup properties for the year ended december 31 2017 consolidated rental income increased 20 consolidated operating expenses comprised of property and maintenance and real estate taxes and insurance increased 23 and consolidated noi increased 19 when compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the increase in noi is primarily a result of the company’s improved noi from same store and leaseup properties partially offset by dilution from disposition activity

fee and asset management revenues decreased approximately 29 million or 799 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of lower revenue earned on management of the company’s military housing ventures at joint base lewis mcchord due to the sale of the company’s entire interest in the management contracts and related rights associated with these ventures in the second quarter of 2016 

property management expenses include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased approximately 70 million or 82 and approximately 35 million or 42 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2017 and the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 respectively the increase is primarily attributable to increases in payrollrelated costs legal and professional fees and computer operations the company anticipates that property management expenses will approximate 960 million to 980 million for the year ending december 31 2019 

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 16 million or 30 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in payrollrelated costs these expenses decreased 56 million or 97 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in payrollrelated costs the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 490 million to 510 million for the year ending december 31 2019

depreciation expense which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 420 million or 56 and approximately 381 million or 54 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2017 and the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 respectively the increase from the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2017 and 2018 and development properties placed in service in 2017 and 2018 partially offset by lower depreciation from properties sold in 2017 and 2018 the increase from the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2017 and development properties placed in service in 2016 and 2017 partially offset by lower depreciation from properties sold in 2016 and 2017

interest and other income increased approximately 92 million during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to an 84 million increase in insurancelitigation settlement proceeds during 2018 compared to the prior year interest and other income decreased approximately 596 million or 907 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to th e approximate 524 million gain from the sale of the company’s entire interest in the management contracts and related rights associated with the military housing ventures at joint base lewis mcchord and approximate 60 million gain from the sale of 421a real estate tax certificates during the year ended december 31 2016 which did not occur in 2017 the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate 12 million to 17 million for the year ending december 31 2019 excluding certain noncomparable insurancelitigation settlement proceeds

 

other expenses increased approximately 121 million during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to insurance litigation and environmental settlements and advocacy contributions in 2018 as compared to 2017 other expenses decreased approximately 52 million or 500 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to higher litigationenvironmental reserve andor settlement costs in 2016 which did not occur at the same levels in 2017 as well as a decrease in annual transaction costs of approximately 15 million in 2017   

interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 323 million or 82 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily as a result of 295 million in higher debt extinguishment costs in 2018 as compared to 2017 interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 1025 million or 207 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of 1099 million in lower debt extinguishment costs in 2017 as compared to 2016 the effective interest cost on all indebtedness excluding debt extinguishment costsprepayment penalties was 432 444 and 468 for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the company capitalized interest of approximately 63 million 263 million and 515 million for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the company anticipates that interest expense excluding debt extinguishment costsprepayment penalties will approximate 3740 million to 3825 million and capitalized interest will approximate 45 million to 85 million for the year ending december 31 2019 

the 2019 guidanceprojections provided above are based on current projections and are forwardlooking

income loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 82 million during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to a gain on the sale of one unconsolidated apartment property totaling 88 million in 2016 that did not occur in 2017

net gain on sales of real estate properties increased approximately 998 million or 635 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily as a result of the sale of five consolidated apartment properties for a sales price of approximately 7061 million during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to five consolidated apartment properties for a sales price of approximately 3550 million sold during the year ended december 31 2017 net gain on sales of real estate properties decreased approximately 39 billion or 961 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of 98 consolidated property sales during the year ended december 31 2016 including the starwood portfolio all of which did not meet the criteria for reporting discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources

shortterm liquidity and cash proceeds

the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility and commercial paper program under normal operating conditions the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions

as of january 1 2018 the company had approximately 506 million of cash and cash equivalents approximately 501 million of restricted deposits and the amount available on its revolving credit facility was 169 billion after taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities at december 31 2018 the company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was approximately 474 million the restricted deposits balance was approximately 689 million and the amount available on its revolving credit facility was 140 billion see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the availability on the company’s revolving credit facility

 

during the year ended december 31 2018 the company generated proceeds from various transactions which included the following 











during the year ended december 31 2018 the above proceeds along with net cash flow from operations and borrowings from the company’s revolving line of credit and commercial paper program were primarily utilized to







credit facility and commercial paper program

in november 2016 the company replaced its existing 25 billion facility with a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing january 10 2022 the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 7500 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be libor plus a spread currently 0825 or based on bids received from the lending group and the company pays an annual facility fee currently 0125 both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the company’s senior unsecured credit rating

in february 2015 the company entered into an unsecured commercial paper note program in the united states the company may borrow up to a maximum of 5000 million under this program subject to market conditions the notes will be sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness as of february 15 2019 there was a balance of 5000 million in principal outstanding on the commercial paper program 

as of february 15 2019 2500 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and 67 million was restricteddedicated to support letters of credit in addition the company limits its utilization of the facility in order to maintain liquidity to support its 5000 million commercial paper program along with certain other obligations as a result the company had approximately 115 billion available under the facility at february 15 2019 this facility may among other potential uses be used to fund property acquisitions costs for certain properties under development and shortterm liquidity requirements

dividend policy

beginning in 2018 the company no longer determines its dividendsdistributions as a fixed percentage of estimated normalized ffo but instead adopted a more conventional policy based on actual and projected financial conditions the company’s actual and projected liquidity and operating results the company’s projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities and such other factors as the company’s board of trustees deems relevant the company declared a dividenddistribution for each quarter in 2018 of 054 per shareunit an annualized increase of 72 over the amount paid in 2017 this policy change is supported by the company’s strong growth in property operations since the recent economic downturn and a significant reduction in its development activity resulting in a material increase in available cash flow all future dividendsdistributions remain subject to the discretion of the company’s board of trustees the company‘s 2018 operating cash flow was sufficient to cover capital expenditures and regular dividendsdistributions

total dividendsdistributions paid in january 2019 amounted to 2066 million excluding distributions on partially owned properties which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2018

 

longterm financing and capital needs 

the company expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as lump sum unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities including additional op units proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and cash generated from operations after all distributions in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that unsecured capital is unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit of the 265 billion in investment in real estate on the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2018 221 billion or 835 was unencumbered however  there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in three major categories and several subcategories







 







all replacements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above

















all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset

the third major category is renovations which primarily consists of expenditures for kitchens and baths designed to reposition the apartment unitsproperties for higher rental levels in their respective markets all renovation expenditures are depreciated over a tenyear estimated useful life

for the year ended december 31 2018 our actual capital expenditures to real estate included the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts

for the year ended december 31 2017 our actual capital expenditures to real estate included the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts

capital expenditures to real estate

for the year ended december 31 2017

 



 













the company estimates that during 2019 it will spend approxima tely 2600 per same store apartment unit or 1900 million of total capital expenditures to real estate for same store properties during 2019 the company expects to spend approximately 400 million for apartment unit renovation expenditures on approximately 3000 same store apartment units at an average cost of approximately 13300 per apartment unit renovated the anticipated total capital expenditures to real estate for same store properties represent approximately the same percentage of same store revenues and a slightly higher cost per unit and absolute dollar amount as compared to 2018 the company plans to continue the capital expenditures for investment in customerfacing building improvements leasing offices fitness centers common areas etc to enhance the quality of our properties and to protect our competitive position given the new luxury supply opening in many of our markets we also expect to maintain our elevated spending on sustainability projects and renovation expenditures during 2019 the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking

during the year ended december 31 2018 the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 45 million the company expects to fund approximately 41 million in total nonreal estate capital additions in 2019 these anticipated fundings are slightly lower than 2018 and are primarily driven by anticipated hardware and software upgrades to various existing systems during 2019 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking

capital expenditures to real estate and nonreal estate capital additions are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow

derivative instruments

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments the company may also use derivatives to manage commodity prices in the daily operations of the business

 

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2018

the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the five critical accounting policies are

acquisition of investment properties

the company allocates the purchase price of properties that meet the definition of an asset acquisition to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their relative fair values in making estimates of relative fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired

impairment of longlived assets

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions and legal and environmental concerns as well as the company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted

depreciation of investment in real estate

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 15year estimated useful life both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacement components 

 

over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life and the renovations component over a 10year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

cost capitalization

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for a discussion of the company’s policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as increases to depreciable property

for all development projects the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as constructioninprogress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired

during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 the company capitalized 132 million 147 million and 187 million respectively of payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of development activities as well as major capital andor renovation projects

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments

the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily derives from the refinancing of its longterm debt and from its floating interest rate instruments that include its unsecured revolving credit facility commercial paper program floating rate taxexempt debt and fair value hedges that convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt such exposure is primarily driven by changes in us treasury rates libor and the sifma index as well as rates implicit in commercial paper markets the company evaluates various factors including its total debt the current and future anticipated economic environment and other factors to manage this risk from time to time the company hedges a portion of future longterm debt issuances

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk derivatives are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured debt including its commercial paper and line of credit if applicable were approximately 24 billion and 65 billion respectively at december 31 2018

at december 31 2018 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 14 billion or 164 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 25 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 36 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 25 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 36 million

at december 31 2018 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 74 billion or 836 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 45 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 67 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 45 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 82 billion

at december 31 2018 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 101 million   if market rates of interest permanently increased by 27 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 09 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 27 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 215 million

at december 31 2017 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 14 billion or 154 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 16 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 22 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 16 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 22 million

 

at december 31 2017 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 76 billion or 846 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 47 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 69 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 47 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 85 billion 

at december 31 2017 the company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 35 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 24 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 77 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 24 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 07 million

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations and appreciation we are focused on the coastal gateway markets of boston new york washington dc southern california including los angeles orange county and san diego san francisco and seattle these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents









 



we believe our strategy also capitalizes on the increasing preference of renters of all ages to live in the urban core of cities or dense suburban locations near transit entertainment and cultural amenities millennials the approximately 78 million people born between 1981 and 2000 are a prime apartment rental demographic reports also show a growing trend among aging baby boomers a demographic of more than 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964 toward apartment rentals we believe that both groups appreciate the locational values described above as well as the flexibility that rental apartments offer

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases review their accounts and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture arrangements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include op units as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales 

as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially occupied properties and may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio into urban and highly walkable closein suburban assets since 2005 the company has sold approximately 199000 apartment units primarily located in the less dense portion of suburban markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately 238 billion acquired nearly 70000 apartment units primarily located in urban and highdensity suburban markets for approximately 205 billion and began approximately 59 billion of development projects primarily located in urban and highdensity suburban markets we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets in the following coastal gateway metropolitan areas boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle

starwood transaction

the company executed an agreement with controlled affiliates of starwood capital group “starwood” on october 23 2015 to sell a portfolio of 72 operating properties consisting of 23262 apartment units located in five markets across the united states for 5365 billion the “starwood transaction” or “starwood portfolio” on january 26 and 27 2016 the company closed on the sale of the entire portfolio described above the sale of the starwood portfolio combined with the other 2016 dispositions resulted in the company’s exit from the south florida denver and new england excluding boston markets and substantially completed the company’s portfolio transformation which started approximately ten years ago these sales narrowed the company’s focus which is now entirely directed towards our coastal gateway markets 

the company used the majority of the proceeds from the starwood transaction and other 2016 dispositions to pay two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of op units of 1100 per shareunit in the aggregate consisting of special dividends of 800 per shareunit approximately 30 billion on march 10 2016 and 300 per shareunit approximately 11 billion on october 14 2016 the company used the majority of the remaining proceeds to reduce aggregate indebtedness in order to make the transaction leverage neutral the company retired approximately 20 billion in secured and unsecured debt the majority of which was scheduled to mature in 2016 and 2017 which improved the company’s already strong credit metrics 

competition

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors for additional information with respect to competition

environmental considerations

see item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations

our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units op units restricted units and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own such securities as our “security holders”

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry

general

real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value these factors include changes in the global national regional and local political and economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes both as rentals and owned housing and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes all of which could increase over time besides utilities we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any other operating expenses including real estate taxes these operating expenses could rise faster than our revenues causing our income to decline in circumstances where we buy or sell properties including large portfolios of properties overhead property management expense and general and administrative expense may not increasedecrease proportionally with the associated changes in revenue costs of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire

when our residents decide to leave our apartments we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local political economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and owned housingcondominiums increasing portions of owned housingcondominium stock being converted to rental use rental housing subsidized by the government other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing governmental regulations slow or negative employment growth and household formation the availability of lowinterest mortgages or the availability of mortgages requiring little or no down payment for single family home buyers changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond our control finally the federal government’s policies many of which may encourage home ownership can increase competition possibly limit our ability to raise rents in our markets and lower the value of our properties consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced

the retailcommercial space including parking garages at our properties primarily serves as an additional amenity for our residents and neighbors the longterm nature of our retailcommercial leases generally five to ten years with market based renewal options and the characteristics of many of our retailcommercial tenants generally small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition the revenues from our retailcommercial space represent approximately 46 of our total rental income

 

changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations and eviction laws and regulations in our markets could have an adverse effect on our operations and property values 

various state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees such as pet fees or application fees we have seen a recent increase in governments considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations for example california may have a ballot measure in november 2018 that would seek to repeal an existing state law that limits the ability of local governments to enact some forms of rent control depending on the extent and terms of future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such issues such future enactments could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and the value of our properties 

state and local governments may also make changes to eviction and other tenants’ rights laws and regulations that could have an adverse impact on our operations and property values under current laws and regulations eviction proceedings for delinquent residents are already costly and timeconsuming especially in markets like new york where housing courts are backlogged if we are restricted from releasing apartment units due to the inability to evict delinquent residents our results of operations and property values may be adversely impacted

we have increased our concentration of properties in our coastal gateway markets which could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely affected by economic or other conditions

over approximately the past ten years the company has exited its noncore markets as part of its strategy to reposition its portfolio leaving the company highly concentrated in its urban and highdensity suburban coastal gateway markets if any one or more of these markets boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle is adversely affected by local or regional economic conditions such as business layoffs industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors local real estate conditions such as oversupply of or reduced demand for multifamily properties or localized environmental issues or natural disasters such conditions may have an increased adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio were more geographically diverse

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions we may be unable to consummate such dispositions in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders

new acquisitions development projects andor renovations may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties that we would like to acquire

we intend to actively acquire develop and renovate multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of leaseup we may be unable to lease these apartment properties on schedule resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues andor lower yields due to lower occupancy and rental rates as well as higher than expected concessions or higher than expected operating expenses we may not be able to achieve rents that are consistent with expectations for acquired developed or renovated properties we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position to complete a development property or to complete a renovation additionally we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts this competition or lack thereof may increase or depress prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties including large portfolios of properties that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure the total number of apartment units under development costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation

in connection with such government regulation we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance

 

development and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban and closein suburban areas we may abandon opportunities including land that we have optioned for purchase that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs and as a result we may fail to recover expenses or option payments already incurred in exploring those opportunities the occupancy rates and rents at a property may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing properties we may be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities

we own certain properties subject to ground leases that may limit our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us terminated or lapse

the company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under several longterm ground leases these ground leases may impose limitations on our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable residents for the properties in addition we could lose our interests in the properties if the ground leases are breached by us terminated or lapse as we get closer to the lease termination dates the values of the properties could decrease without an extension in place certain of these ground leases have payments subject to annual escalations andor periodic fair market value adjustments which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority regarding major decisions our reliance on our joint venture partners’ financial condition any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners

we currently do and may continue in the future to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures we have several joint ventures with other real estate investors joint venture investments involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties including the following

















at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners we also have in the past and could choose in the future to guarantee part of or all of certain joint venture debt frequently we and our partners may 

 

each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners’ interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate and recognize attractive returns on our joint venture investments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and distributions to our shareholders 

several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction along with certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures as part of the archstone transaction as well as certain other tax protected properties we have acquired over the years are subject to tax protection agreements which could limit our flexibility with respect to our ownership of such assets or cause us to incur material costs

several of the assets we acquired from archstone enterprise lp “archstone” in february 2013 are subject to various agreements limiting the ability of the owner of the property to take actions that would trigger income tax liability for the contributing owner of the property including a taxable disposition of the property we assumed these obligations upon the completion of the archstone transaction in addition we will also be required to maintain a certain amount of qualified nonrecourse financing on the tax protected properties during their respective restricted periods our obligations relating to these tax protected properties as well as certain other tax protected properties we have acquired over the years may affect the way in which we conduct our business including whether when and under what circumstances we sell properties or interests therein and the timing and nature of our financings and refinancing transactions as a result we may not be able to dispose of or refinance the tax protected properties when to do so may have otherwise been favorable to us and our shareholders which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures as part of the archstone transaction have complex tax requirements that if violated may cause us to be required to indemnify the preferred shareholders or our joint venture partner for certain tax protection costs

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including but not limited to the following





























 

issuances or sales of our common shares may be dilutive 

the issuance or sale of substantial amounts of our common shares whether directly by us or in the secondary market the perception that such issuances or sales of our common shares could occur or the availability for future issuance or sale of our common shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common shares could have a dilutive effect on our actual and expected earnings per share ffo per share and normalized ffo per share the actual amount of dilution cannot be determined at this time and would be dependent upon numerous factors which are not currently known to us

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of regular distributions to our security holders however whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for additional discussion regarding our dividend policy

the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company

from time to time the company holds investment securities andor cash investments that have various levels of repayment and liquidity risk including government obligations and bond funds money market funds or bank deposits on occasion we also may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank substantially exceeds the fdic insurance limit or we invest cash in money market or similar type funds with investment management institutions that may be subject to now or in the future liquidity andor withdrawal restrictions resulting in risk to the company of loss or lack of immediate availability of funds if these banks or institutions fail to meet their obligations

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in our cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of our confidential information andor damage to our reputation and business relationships all of which could negatively impact our financial results

a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information including information regarding our residents prospective residents employees and employees’ dependents 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures required employee awareness training and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems and systems maintained by third party vendors with which we do business are vulnerable to damage from any number of sources we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails phishing attempts or other scams persons inside our organization or personsvendors with access to our systems and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems our information technology networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees and their dependents in 

 

addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information technology networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others a engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems b conducting periodic testing and verification of information and data security systems including performing ethical hacks of our systems to discover where any vulnerabilities may exist and c providing periodic employee awareness training around phishing and other scams malware and other cyber risks we also maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches see further discussion on cyber risk insurance below however there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent a cyber incident or that our cyber risk insurance coverage will be sufficient in the event of a cyber incident 

a breach or significant and extended disruption in the function of our systems including our primary website could damage our reputation and cause us to lose residents and revenues generate third party claims result in the unintended andor unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary personally identifiable and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers our insurers or any other responsible parties as a result there can be no assurance that our financial results would not be adversely impacted 

litigation risk could affect our business

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer shareholder securities employment environmental development condominium conversion tort eviction and commercial legal issues any of which could result in a class action lawsuit that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations

environmental problems are possible and can be costly

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future

we are aware that some of our properties have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those properties while we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our properties there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future

there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property should mold become an issue in the future our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected

 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

insurance policies can be costly and may not cover all losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

as of december 31 2017 the company’s property insurance policies provide for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 earthquake losses are subject to a 2 deductible in the state of washington and a 5 deductible in california applied to the values of the buildings involved in the loss the company also typically selfinsures a substantial portion of the first 50 million of a property loss in excess of these base deductibles should a claim exceed these amounts it would be 100 covered by insurance furthermore the company purchased additional coverage in the event that the company suffers multiple noncatastrophic occurrences with losses from 25 million to 50 million within the same policy year the company’s general liability and worker’s compensation policies at december 31 2017 provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses the company also has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio becoming more concentrated in fewer more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint furthermore the potential impact of climate change increased severe weather or earthquakes could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

the company also has 7500 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses

as of december 31 2017 the company’s cyber liability insurance policy provides for a 50 million policy aggregate limit and a per occurrence deductible of 250000 cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers this cyber policy would cover the cost of victim notification credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses

the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability and worker’s compensation insurance while there has yet to be any nonperformance by these major insurance providers should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact the company in addition the company annually assesses its insurance needs based on the cost of coverage and other factors we may choose to self insure a greater portion of this risk in the future or may choose to have higher deductibles or lesser policy terms

damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events and climate change could result in losses to the company

certain of our properties are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including fires snow or ice storms windstorms or hurricanes earthquakes flooding or other severe weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future revenue from that property we could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations

to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue

 

the inability of lehman to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us under the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction could increase our liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to certain indemnification obligations of each party to the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction relating to breaches of fundamental representations and warranties and breaches of covenants and certain other specified matters we negotiated as a term in the purchase agreement that lehman brothers holdings inc “lehman” retain responsibility for and indemnify us against damages resulting from certain thirdparty claims or other liabilities these thirdparty claims and other liabilities include without limitation costs associated with various litigation matters lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in september 2008 and is currently in the process of postpetition liquidation if lehman completes its liquidation prior to the termination of their indemnity obligations to us under the purchase agreement or otherwise distributes substantially all of its assets to its creditors prior to such time lehman may not be able to satisfy its obligations with respect to claims and retained liabilities covered by the purchase agreement the failure of lehman to satisfy such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition because claimants may successfully assert that we are liable for those claims andor retained liabilities in addition certain obligations of lehman to indemnify us terminated upon expiration of the applicable indemnification period generally no more than four years following the closing or february 27 2017 the assertion of thirdparty claims after the expiration of the applicable indemnification period or the failure of lehman to satisfy its indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

nonperformance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance

we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties as a result defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided or volatility in the financial markets could affect counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations

debt financing and preferred sharespreference units could adversely affect our performance

general

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s debt summaries as of december 31 2017

in addition to debt we have a liquidation value of 373 million of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interestpreference units with a dividend preference of 829 per annum as of december 31 2017 our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions

dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly andor to decline

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance

through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac the “government sponsored enterprises” or “gses” are significant lenders and enhancers of taxexempt bonds both to the company and to buyers of the company’s properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have an impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our secured borrowings disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit market’s perception of the gses which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on our taxexempt debt obligations these bonds could 

 

also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets 

nonperformance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the revolving credit facility impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders’ requirements at the lower ratings level

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2017

financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our revolving credit facility contains certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our revolving credit facility and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 should it fall out of compliance it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds or otherwise contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions including affordability requirements the company and from time to time its consultants monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities

 

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 269 as of december 31 2017 in addition our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows

 



 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our operations and cash flows

​the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to the refinancing of its longterm debt and floating interest rate instruments that include its unsecured revolving credit facility commercial paper program floating rate taxexempt debt and fair value hedges that convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt these exposures to interest rates are primarily driven by changes in longterm us treasury rates for refinancing activity changes in shortterm london interbank offered rate “libor” borrowing rates and the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” index for floating rate debt and changes in commercial paper market conditions increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect our operations and cash flows and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders

derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow

in the normal course of business we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments including hedging for future debt issuances at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates we may also use derivatives to manage commodity prices in the daily operations of our business there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact these arrangements which can include a number of counterparties may expose us to additional risks including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts and may involve extensive costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate or commodity pricing fluctuations

we depend on our key personnel

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer “ceo” if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders

 

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the company’s ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit we have issued several of these waivers in the past

our preferred shares may affect changes in control

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders

our status as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements in addition certain of our subsidiary entities have elected to be taxed as reits as such each must separately satisfy all of the requirements to qualify for reit status our failure to comply with the complex reit rules at the subsidiary reit level can materially and adversely impact eqr’s reit status

even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status however the reit qualification rules permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status there is also risk that congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status

 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income 

the effect of the tax act is uncertain

on december 22 2017 the president signed into law hr 1 informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” with most provisions having an initial effective date of january 1 2018 the tax act makes major changes to the internal revenue code as amended including several provisions that may affect the taxation of reits and their security holders the tax act is not expected to have a material impact on our reit or subsidiary entities the size and character of our dividends our ability to continue to qualify as a reit or on our results of operations in addition the tax act is expected to have a favorable impact on the effective tax rate of our shareholders and our residents however the complete impact of the tax act is not yet fully known and there can be no assurances that it will have a neutral or favorable impact technical corrections or other amendments to the tax act or administrative guidance interpreting the tax act may be forthcoming at any time prospective and current shareholders should consult with their tax advisors with respect to the effect of the tax act and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on your investment

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that were the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition and our shareholders’ liquidity

distribution requirements may limit our flexibility to manage our portfolio

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received we may incur a reduction in tax depreciation without a reduction in capital expenditures provisions of the tax act may require that we depreciate existing assets over a 30year or potentially a 40year useful life which may substantially increase our taxable income in addition gain from the sale of property may exceed the amount of cash received on a leverageneutral basis a substantial increase to our taxable income may reduce the flexibility of the company to manage its portfolio through dispositions of properties in non1031 exchange transactions or cause the company to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company or our shareholders

under certain circumstances we have made andor may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the internal revenue code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability

the internal revenue service has published several rulings that allow reits to offer shareholders the choice of stock or cash with respect to the receipt of a dividend an “elective stock dividend” however reits are also permitted to limit the amount of cash paid to all shareholders to 20 of the total dividend paid therefore it is possible that the total tax burden to shareholders resulting from an elective stock dividend may exceed the amount of cash received by the shareholder

 

federal income tax considerations 

general

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flowthrough entity for federal income tax purposes

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service

our taxation

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries engaged in activities which cannot be performed directly by a reit such as condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income generated by these activities in our taxable reit subsidiaries

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements for tax years prior to january 1 2018 we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference pursuant to the tax act for tax years beginning january 1 2018 the corporate alternative minimum tax has been permanently eliminated in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year

 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates also for tax years prior to january 1 2018 we may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a “taxable reit subsidiary” or “trs” provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 25 of the reit’s total asset value 20 for taxable years beginning january 1 2018 trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 





to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered 

 

impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit

asset tests  in general on the last day of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets 











the 10 value test described in clause 3b above does not apply to nonqualified publicly offered reit debt instruments or to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer’s debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these 

 

distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above and any changes in the federal tax code may not be adopted by the states potentially leading to material tax liabilities for the company and its shareholders in addition state and local taxing jurisdictions may adopt new legislation or tax regimes which could significantly impact our tax liabilities or require the company to withhold taxes from shareholders consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december with a record date in such month are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit’s earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distributions paid in january exceed available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years

a reit may make an election under the internal revenue code to treat certain dividends that are paid in a taxable year as being made by the reit in the previous taxable year a shareholder is required to include the amount of the dividend in the taxable year that it is paid by the reit

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year or the amount of 

 

distributions treated as dividends for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

generally our designated capital gain dividends will be broken out into net capital gains distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20 for individual taxpayers in the highest tax bracket and unrecaptured section 1250 gain distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25

certain us shareholders that are taxed as individuals estates or trusts may also be required to pay an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between





the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code in addition certain provisions of the tax act may impact a taxexempt shareholder’s calculation of ubti these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the impact of the tax act and their federal income tax obligations

 

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

taxation of foreign shareholders

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than







distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless





if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless





 

under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder other than certain qualified shareholders and qualified foreign pension funds discussed below that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 21 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability 

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition if timely requested foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability

foreign shareholders’ sales of common shares gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 





even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if





if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 15 of the purchase price

exception to firpta for qualified shareholders for dispositions and distributions after december 18 2015 stock of a reit held directly or through partnerships by a “qualified shareholder” will not be treated as united states real property interest and capital gain dividends from such a reit will not be treated as gain from the sale of a united states real property interest this exception does not apply to persons that hold an interest taking into account applicable constructive ownership rules more than 10 of the stock of the reit unless that interest is solely as a creditor an “applicable investor” if the qualified shareholder has such an “applicable investor” the portion of reit stock indirectly owned through the qualified shareholder by the applicable investor will be treated as gains from the sale of united states real property interests for these purposes a “qualified shareholder” is a foreign person which is in a treaty jurisdiction and satisfies certain publicly traded requirements is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” and maintains records on the identity of certain 5 owners a 

 

“qualified collective investment vehicle” is a foreign person that is eligible for a reduced withholding rate with respect to ordinary reit dividends even if such person holds more than 10 of the reit’s stock a publicly traded partnership that is a withholding foreign partnership that would be a united states real property holding corporation if it were a united states corporation or is designated as a qualified collective investment vehicle by the secretary of the treasury and is either fiscally transparent within the meaning of the code or required to include dividends in its gross income but entitled to a deduction for distribution to its investors finally capital gain dividends and nondividend redemption and liquidating distributions to a qualified shareholder that are not allocable to an applicable investor will be treated as ordinary dividends 

exception to firpta withholding for qualified foreign pension funds for distributions or disposition of reit stock after december 18 2015 “qualified foreign pension funds” and entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund are exempted from firpta withholding for these purposes a “qualified foreign pension fund” is any trust corporation or other organization or arrangement if i it was created or organized under foreign law ii it was established to provide retirement or pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees of one or more employers in consideration for services rendered iii it does not have a single participant or beneficiary with a right to more than 5 of its assets or income iv it is subject to government regulation and provides annual information reporting about its beneficiaries to the relevant tax authorities in the country in which it is established or operates and v under the laws of the country in which it is established or operates either contributions to such fund which would otherwise be subject to tax under such laws are deductible or excluded from the gross income of such fund or taxed at a reduced rate or taxation of any investment income of such fund is deferred or such income is taxed at a reduced rate 

information reporting requirement and backup withholding

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service

withholding on foreign financial institutions and nonus shareholders

the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” imposes a us withholding tax at a 30 rate on dividends and on proceeds from the sale of our shares paid beginning january 1 2019 to “foreign financial institutions” as defined under fatca and certain other foreign entities if certain due diligence and disclosure requirements related to us accounts with or ownership of such entities are not satisfied or an exemption does not apply if fatca withholding is imposed nonus beneficial owners that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from or a reduction of us withholding tax with respect to such distributions and sale proceeds would be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction any payment made by us that is subject to withholding under fatca or otherwise will be net of the amount required to be withheld

same store results

properties that the company owned and were stabilized see definition below for all of both 2017 and 2016 the “2017 same store properties” which represented 70117 apartment units and properties that the company owned and were 

 

stabilized for all of both 2016 and 2015 the “2016 same store properties” which represented 69879 apartment units impacted the company’s results of operations both the 2017 same store properties and 2016 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less direct property operating expenses including real estate taxes and insurance the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment properties

the following tables provide a rollforward of the apartment units included in same store properties and a reconciliation of apartment units included in same store properties to those included in total properties for the year ended december 31 2017

 



 



 

note properties are considered “stabilized” when they have achieved 90 occupancy for three consecutive months properties are included in same store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented







 

revenues from the 2017 and 2016 same store properties increased 485 million and 781 million respectively primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents expenses from the 2017 and 2016 same store properties increased 170 million and 202 million respectively primarily as a result of an increase in real estate taxes onsite payroll costs and repairs and maintenance expenses the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2017 and 2016 same store properties

for properties that the company acquired or completed that were stabilized prior to january 1 2017 and that the company expects to continue to own through december 31 2018 the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2018 which assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

 



 

same store revenues increased 22 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 which was ahead of our original expectations and in line with our most recent guidance that was provided in october 2017 due to stronger renewal rates lower turnover and gains in occupancy the company’s primary goal in 2017 was to focus on retaining existing residents to drive renewal rate growth which came in at 46 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 same store turnover declined by 18 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 the company’s primary focus for 2018 will continue to be on retaining existing residents we currently estimate same store revenues to increase in a range from 10 to 225 for 2018 as compared to 2017 

 

washington dc was the only market in our portfolio that did not meet or surpass our most recent guidance that was provided in october 2017 same store revenues increased 13 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 as uncertainty in the market caused by the political environment slowed economic activity while we expect to see slight improvement in new lease rates in 2018 we expect washington dc to remain challenged as a result we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 10 in this market in 2018

in the new york market elevated deliveries of new luxury supply both in established residential areas and newer residential areas like long island city are having an impact on our ability to raise rents while technology sector job growth continues there has been a reduction in the rate of job growth in the financial services sector which is an important demand driver in this market however due in part to our strong same store occupancy levels 962 for the year ended december 31 2017 we used fewer concessions during 2017 than we originally expected same store revenues increased 01 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 which was above both our original expectations and our most recent guidance provided in october 2017 with new luxury supply elevated in 2018 we expect there to be a decline in same store revenues of approximately 075 in 2018

 

boston continues to feel the impact from an elevated level of deliveries of new supply in the downtown and cambridge submarkets though job growth has continued to improve as a result the additional supply has generally been absorbed thus far without significant disruption same store revenues increased 16 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 which was in line with our original expectations and most recent guidance provided in october 2017 we believe renewal and occupancy rates will continue to remain strong while new lease rates will continue to be negative we therefore expect 2018 same store revenue growth of approximately 16 which is identical to 2017 

 

seattle produced solid rental rate growth driven by the continued growth in technology jobs in the market but showed signs of slowing rent growth towards the end of 2017 same store revenues increased 56 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 which exceeded our original expectations and is generally consistent with the most recent guidance provided in october 2017 we are more cautious on our 2018 outlook with more moderate growth expected in both renewals and new leases primarily due to increased urban supply and moderating job growth we expect seattle to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 325 in 2018

 

san francisco performed better than expected in 2017 primarily as a result of strong occupancy and gains on renewals the market is producing a slower rate of job growth in the technology sector compared to previous years however we continue to see strong demand throughout the market although the rate at which we can increase rents remains somewhat modest due to new supply and a slower rate of job growth as a result same store revenues increased 20 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 which exceeded our original expectations and is generally consistent with the most recent guidance provided in october 2017 while we expect to see slight improvement in new lease rates in 2018 we expect lower occupancy and renewal rates as a result we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 175 in 2018

 

southern california which includes los angeles orange county and san diego was one of our better performing markets in 2017 widely dispersed new supply very good economic growth and adequate levels of job growth in the market 

 

are driving strong revenue growth same store revenues increased 39 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 which slightly exceeded both our original expectations and the most recent guidance we provided in october 2017 we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 325 in los angeles and 40 in both orange county and san diego in 2018 

 

same store expenses increased 27 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 the full year 2017 results were primarily due to the following items  

 



 



 



 

we anticipate same store expenses to increase in a range from 35 to 45 for 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to the following items

 



 



 



 

same store noi increased 20 for the full year 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 which was at the high end of our original expectations and slightly ahead of our most recent guidance that was provided in october 2017 the company anticipates same store noi growth of approximately 00 to 15 for the full year 2018 as a result of the above same store revenue and expense expectations

nonsame storeother results

 

nonsame store noi results increased approximately 04 million in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2016 and 2017 operations from the company’s development properties and operations prior to disposition from 2016 and 2017 sold properties this difference is due primarily to

 







 



 

 

nonsame store noi results decreased approximately 2775 million in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2015 and 2016 operations from the company’s development properties and operations prior to disposition from 2015 and 2016 sold properties including the starwood portfolio this difference is due primarily to 







 

the company’s guidance assumes consolidated rental acquisitions of 5000 million and consolidated rental dispositions of 5000 million and assumes that the acquisition cap rate will be 050 lower than the disposition yield for the full year ending december 31 2018 the company currently budgets one development start during the year ending december 31 2018 we currently budget spending approximately 1500 million on development costs during the year ending december 31 2018 primarily for projects currently under construction and on the one project expected to start in 2018 we assume that this capital will be primarily sourced with excess operating cash flow future debt offerings and borrowings on our revolving credit facility andor commercial paper program these 2018 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking

comparison of the year ended december 31 2017 to the year ended december 31 2016 and the year ended december 31 2016 to the year ended december 31 2015

for the year ended december 31 2017 the company reported diluted earnings per shareunit of 163 compared to 1168 per shareunit for the year ended december 31 2016 the difference is primarily due to approximately 1016 per shareunit in higher gains on property sales and 014 per shareunit in higher gains on sales of nonoperating assets in 2016 compared to 2017 as a direct result of the significant sales activity in 2016 compared to 2017 partially offset by 029 per shareunit in higher debt extinguishment costs incurred in 2016 as compared to 2017 for the year ended december 31 2016 the company reported diluted earnings per shareunit of 1168 compared to 236 per shareunit for the year ended december 31 2015 the difference is primarily due to approximately 969 per shareunit in higher gains on property sales and 018 per shareunit in higher gains on sales of nonoperating assets in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a direct result of the significant sales activity in 2016 partially offset by 030 per shareunit in higher debt extinguishment costs and lower overall noi as a result of the sales noted above in 2016 compared to 2015

property management expenses include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased approximately 35 million or 42 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to increases in educationconference fees legal fees office rent and payrollrelated costs these expenses decreased approximately 42 million or 49 during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in payrollrelated costs office rent and educationconference fees partially offset by increases in computer operations costs the company anticipates that property management expenses will

depreciation expense which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 381 million or 54 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2017 and development properties placed in service in 2016 and 2017 partially offset by lower depreciation from properties sold in 2016 and 2017 depreciation expense decreased approximately 602 million or 79 during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of no depreciation or a partial period of depreciation expense during the year ended december 31 2016 related to the significant property sales in 2016 including the starwood portfolio partially offset by additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2016 and development properties placed in service

interest and other income decreased approximately 596 million or 907 and increased approximately 584 million during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 and the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 2015 respectively primarily due to the approximate 524 million gain from the sale of the company’s entire interest in the management contracts and related rights associated with the military housing ventures at joint base lewis mcchord and approximate 60 million gain from the sale of 421a real estate tax certificates during the year ended december 31 2016 neither of which occurred in 2017 or 2015 the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate 05 million to 10 million for the year ending december 31 2018 excluding certain noncomparable insurancelitigation settlement proceeds

other expenses decreased approximately 52 million or 500 and increased 74 million during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 and the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 2015 respectively primarily due to higher litigationenvironmental reserve andor settlement costs in 2016 which did not occur at the same levels in 2017 and 2015 as well as a decrease in annual transaction costs of approximately 15 million in 2017 in addition the company anticipates that substantially all of its transactions will now be accounted for as asset acquisitions which means that transaction costs will largely be capitalized as a result of its adoption of the new definition of a business standard effective january 1 2017 see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 1025 million or 207 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of 1099 million in lower debt extinguishment costs in 2017 as compared to 2016 interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 396 million or 87 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of prepayment penalties and debt extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of approximately 17 billion in debt principal prior to scheduled maturity partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of these repayments the effective interest cost on all indebtedness was 444 468 and 472 for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the company capitalized interest of approximately 263 million 515 million and 599 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the company anticipates that interest expense from continuing operations excluding debt extinguishment costsprepayment penalties will approximate 3705 million to 3831 million and capitalized interest will approximate 40 million to 80 million for the year ending december 31 2018

the 2018 guidanceprojections provided above are based on current projections and are forwardlooking

income loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 82 million and 102 million during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 and the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 2015 respectively the decrease in 2017 is primarily due to a gain on the sale of one unconsolidated apartment property totaling 88 million in 2016 that did not occur in 2017 the decrease in 2016 is primarily due to 186 million in favorable litigation 

 

settlements which occurred during the year ended december 31 2015 partially offset by a gain on the sale of one unconsolidated apartment property totaling 88 million which occurred during the year ended december 31 2016

liquidity and capital resources

shortterm liquidity and cash proceeds

the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility and commercial paper program under normal operating conditions the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions

as of january 1 2017 the company had approximately 772 million of cash and cash equivalents approximately 1419 million of restricted deposits and the amount available on its revolving credit facility was 196 billion net of 206 million which was restricteddedicated to support letters of credit and net of 200 million in principal outstanding on the commercial paper program after taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities at december 31 2017 the company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was approximately 583 million the restricted deposits balance was approximately 501 million and the amount available on its revolving credit facility was 169 billion net of 66 million which was restricteddedicated to support letters of credit and net of 3000 million in principal outstanding on the commercial paper program

during the year ended december 31 2017 the company generated proceeds from various transactions which included the following









during the year ended december 31 2017 the above proceeds along with net cash flow from operations and borrowings from the company’s revolving line of credit and commercial paper program were primarily utilized to









 

credit facility and commercial paper program 

on november 3 2016 the company replaced its existing 25 billion facility with a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing january 10 2022 the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 7500 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be libor plus a spread currently 0825 or based on bids received from the lending group and the company pays an annual facility fee currently 125 basis points both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the company’s longterm debt

on february 2 2015 the company entered into an unsecured commercial paper note program in the united states the company may borrow up to a maximum of 5000 million under this program subject to market conditions the notes will be sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness as of february 16 2018 there was a balance of 3200 million outstanding on the commercial paper program 

as of february 16 2018 no amounts were outstanding and the amount available on the revolving credit facility was 167 billion net of 66 million which was restricteddedicated to support letters of credit and net of the 3200 million in principal outstanding on the commercial paper program this facility may among other potential uses be used to fund property acquisitions costs for certain properties under development and shortterm liquidity requirements

dividend policy

for the past several years the company adhered to a policy of paying its annual dividendsdistributions based on 65 of the midpoint of the range of initial normalized ffo guidance customarily provided at the beginning of each year as part of the company’s fourth quarter earnings release the company’s 2017 regular annual dividenddistribution payout was 2015 per shareunit and the company paid four regular quarterly dividendsdistributions of 050375 per shareunit in 2017 

beginning in 2018 the company will no longer determine its dividendsdistributions as a fixed percentage of estimated normalized ffo but will instead adopt a more conventional policy based on actual and projected financial conditions the company’s actual and projected liquidity and operating results the company’s projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities and such other factors as the company’s board of trustees deems relevant the company currently expects to declare a dividenddistribution for the first quarter of 2018 of 054 per shareunit an annualized increase of 72 over the amount paid in 2017 this policy change is supported by the company’s strong growth in property operations since the recent economic downturn and a significant reduction in its development activity resulting in a material increase in available cash flow all future dividendsdistributions remain subject to the discretion of the company’s board of trustees the company believes that its expected 2018 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and regular dividendsdistributions

total dividendsdistributions paid in january 2018 amounted to 1928 million excluding distributions on partially owned properties which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2017

longterm financing and capital needs

the company expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as lump sum unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities including additional op units proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and cash generated from operations after all distributions in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes line of credit and commercial paper program of the 260 billion in investment in real estate on the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2017 201 billion or 771 was unencumbered however  there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise

see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to december 31 2017

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in three major categories and several subcategories













all replacements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above

















all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset

 

the third major category is renovations which primarily consists of expenditures for kitchens and baths designed to reposition the apartment unitsproperties for higher rental levels in their respective markets all renovation expenditures are depreciated over a tenyear estimated useful life 

for the year ended december 31 2017 our actual capital expenditures to real estate included the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts

the company estimates that during 2018 it will spend approximately 2900 per same store apartment unit or 2100 million of total capital expenditures to real estate during 2018 the company expects to spend approximately 600 million for apartment unit renovation expenditures on approximately 4500 same store apartment units at an average cost of approximately 13300 per apartment unit renovated the anticipated total capital expenditures to real estate amounts represent approximately the same percentage of same store revenues but an increase in the cost per unit and in the absolute dollar amounts over 2017 the company plans to continue the elevated capital expenditures for investment in customerfacing building improvements leasing offices fitness centers common areas etc to enhance the quality of our properties and to protect our competitive position given the new luxury supply opening in many of our markets we also expect to maintain our elevated spending on sustainability projects and renovation expenditures during 2018 the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking

during the year ended december 31 2017 the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 15 million the company expects to fund approximately 66 million in total nonreal estate capital additions in 2018 these anticipated fundings represent an increase over 2017 which is primarily driven by anticipated hardware and software upgrades to various existing systems during 2018 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking

capital expenditures to real estate and nonreal estate capital additions are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow

derivative instruments

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2017 and are materially consistent with the year ended december 31 2016

the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the five critical accounting policies are

acquisition of investment properties

the company allocates the purchase price of properties that meet the definition of an asset acquisition to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their relative fair values in making estimates of relative fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired

impairment of longlived assets

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions and legal and environmental concerns as well as the company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted

depreciation of investment in real estate

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 15year estimated useful life both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacement components over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life and the renovations component over a 10year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations

cost capitalization

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for a discussion of the company’s policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as increases to depreciable property

for all development projects the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as constructioninprogress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired

 

during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 the company capitalized 147 million 187 million and 223 million respectively of payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of development activities as well as major capital andor renovation projects 

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments

the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to the refinancing of its longterm debt and floating interest rate instruments that include its unsecured revolving credit facility commercial paper program floating rate taxexempt debt and fair value hedges that convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt these exposures to interest rates are primarily driven by changes in longterm us treasury rates for refinancing activity changes in shortterm libor borrowing rates and the sifma index for floating rate debt and changes in commercial paper market conditions the company evaluates various factors including its total debt the current and future anticipated economic environment and other factors to manage this risk we generally hedge a portion of future longterm debt issuances and target a level of floating rate debt of 20 or less depending upon market conditions to the extent the company carries substantial cash balances this will tend to partially counterbalance any changes in interest rates 

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk derivatives are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured debt including its commercial paper and line of credit if applicable were approximately 36 billion and 56 billion respectively at december 31 2017

 

at december 31 2017 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 14 billion or 154 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 16 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 22 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 16 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 22 million 

at december 31 2017 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 76 billion or 846 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 47 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 69 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 47 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 85 billion

at december 31 2017 the company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 35 million   if market rates of interest permanently increased by 24 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 77 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 24 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 07 million

at december 31 2016 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 11 billion or 123 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 11 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 13 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 11 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 13 million

at december 31 2016 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 79 billion or 877 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 49 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 72 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 49 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 88 billion

at december 31 2016 the company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 19 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 24 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 04 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 24 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 34 million

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

the company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations and appreciation we are focused on the six coastal markets of boston new york washington dc southern california including los angeles orange county and san diego san francisco and seattle these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents 

 we believe our strategy also capitalizes on the increasing preference of renters of all ages to live in the urban core of cities or dense suburban locations near transit entertainment and cultural amenities millennials the 83 million people between ages 18 and 34 are a prime apartment rental demographic reports also show a growing trend among aging baby boomers a demographic of more than 76 million people between the ages of 53 and 71 toward apartment rentals we believe that both groups appreciate the locational values described above as well as the flexibility that rental apartments offer 

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases review their accounts and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture agreements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially occupied properties and may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings 

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio into urban and highly walkable closein suburban assets since 2005 the company has sold nearly 198000 apartment units primarily located in the less dense portions of suburban markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately 235 billion acquired nearly 69000  apartment units primarily located in urban and highdensity suburban markets for approximately 200 billion and began approximately 57 billion  of development projects primarily located in urban and highdensity suburban markets we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets in the following six core coastal metropolitan areas boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle the sale of the starwood portfolio as defined below combined with the other 2016 dispositions has resulted in the companys exit from the south florida denver and new england excluding boston markets and has substantially completed the companys portfolio transformation which started approximately ten years ago see further discussion below regarding the companys 2016 disposition activity 

we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education resources and opportunities to succeed we have a commitment to diversity in all of its forms and strive to promote and maintain a work environment where all employees are treated with dignity and respect offered opportunities for professional development and valued for their unique contributions to the companys success we provide many classroom and online training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining our properties and improvements equipment and appliances we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions we monitor our employees engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores 

we have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities sustainability and social responsibility are key drivers of our focus on creating the best apartment communities for residents to live work and play we have a dedicated inhouse team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business including investment activities development property operations and property management activities with its high density multifamily housing is by its nature an environmentally friendly property type our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrianfriendly urban and closein suburban locations near public transportation when developing and renovating our properties we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets we continue to implement a combination of irrigation lighting hvac and renewable energy improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption the company was named the 2016 global residential listed sector leader in sustainability by gresb a globally recognized analysis of the sustainability indicators of more than 750 real estate portfolios worldwide the company was also recently awarded the residential leader in the light award for sustainability by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit for additional information regarding our sustainability efforts see our december 2016 corporate social responsibility and sustainability report at our website wwwequityapartmentscom  for 2017 we continue to have an express companywide goal regarding enhanced sustainability efforts employees including our executives will have their performance against our various social responsibility goals evaluated as part of our annual performance review process 

competition 

all of the companys properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the companys ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the companys managers in addition other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors for additional information with respect to competition 

starwood transaction 

following the approval by the companys board of trustees the company executed an agreement with controlled affiliates of starwood capital group starwood on october 23 2015 to sell a portfolio of 72 operating properties consisting of 23262 apartment units located in five markets across the united states for 5365 billion the starwood transaction or starwood portfolio on january 26 and 27 2016 the company closed on the sale of the entire portfolio described above the sale of the starwood portfolio combined with the other 2016 dispositions has resulted in the companys exit from the south florida denver and new england excluding boston markets and has substantially completed the companys portfolio transformation which started approximately ten years ago these sales have narrowed the companys focus which is now entirely directed towards our six coastal markets we believe the assets sold will have lower longterm returns as compared to investments in our six coastal markets and that we sold them for prices that are favorable given the strong demand for multifamily assets in our six coastal markets from institutional investors and the challenge in recycling 68 billion of capital in this competitive marketplace the company believed the best riskadjusted use of the sale proceeds was to distribute a portion to our shareholders and use the remainder to repay outstanding debt see further discussion below 

the company used the majority of the proceeds from the starwood transaction and other 2016 dispositions to pay two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of op units of 1100 per shareunit in the aggregate the company paid special dividends of 800 per shareunit approximately 30 billion on march 10 2016 and 300  per shareunit approximately 11 billion on october 14 2016 the company used the majority of the remaining proceeds to reduce aggregate indebtedness in order to make the transaction leverage neutral the company retired approximately 20 billion in secured and unsecured debt the majority of which was scheduled to mature in 2016 and 2017 improving the companys already strong credit metrics

environmental considerations 

see item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

general 

references to eqr mean equity residential a maryland real estate investment trust reit and references to erpop mean erp operating limited partnership an illinois limited partnership unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “company” “we” “us” or “our” mean collectively eqr erpop and those entitiessubsidiaries owned or controlled by eqr andor erpop and the term “operating partnership” means collectively erpop and those entitiessubsidiaries owned or controlled by erpop this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units op units restricted units and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own such securities as our “security holders” 

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 

general 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value these factors include changes in the global national regional and local political and economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes both as rentals and owned housing and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes all of which could increase over time these operating expenses could rise faster than our revenues causing our income to decline in circumstances where we buy or sell properties including large portfolios of properties overhead property management expense and general and administrative expense may not increasedecrease proportionally with the associated changes in revenue costs of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

  

when our residents decide to leave our apartments we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local political economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and owned housingcondominiums increasing portions of owned housingcondominium stock being converted to rental use rental housing subsidized by the government other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing governmental 

regulations slow or negative employment growth and household formation the availability of lowinterest mortgages or the availability of mortgages requiring little or no down payment for single family home buyers changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond our control in addition various state and local municipalities have enacted and may continue to enact rent control legislation or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents finally the federal governments policies many of which may encourage home ownership can increase competition and possibly limit our ability to raise rents consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 

the retailcommercial space at our properties primarily serves as an additional amenity for our residents and neighbors the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases generally five to ten years with market based renewal options and the characteristics of many of our tenants generally small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition the revenues from our retailcommercial space represent approximately 45 of our total rental income 

we have increased our concentration of properties in our core markets which could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely affected by economic or other conditions 

over the past ten years the company has exited its noncore markets as part of its strategy to reposition its portfolio leaving the company highly concentrated in its six core coastal markets if any one or more of our core markets boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle is adversely affected by local or regional economic conditions such as business layoffs industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors or local real estate conditions such as oversupply of or reduced demand for multifamily properties such conditions may have an increased adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio were more geographically diverse 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions we may be unable to consummate such dispositions in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

new acquisitions development projects andor rehabs may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties that we would like to acquire 

we intend to actively acquire develop and rehab multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues andor lower yields due to lower occupancy and rental rates as well as higher than expected concessions or higher than expected operating expenses we may not be able to achieve rents that are consistent with expectations for acquired developed or rehabbed properties we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position to complete a development property or to complete a rehab additionally we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts this competition or lack thereof may increase or depress prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties including large portfolios of properties that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure the total number of apartment units under development costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

in connection with such government regulation we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance 

development and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban and closein suburban areas we may abandon opportunities including land that we have optioned for purchase that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs and as a result we may fail to recover expenses or option payments already incurred in exploring those opportunities the occupancy rates and rents at a property may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing properties we may be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities 

we own certain properties subject to ground leases that may limit our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated 

the company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under several longterm ground leases these ground leases may impose limitations on our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties impair the properties value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable residents for the properties in addition we could lose our interests in the properties if the ground leases are breached by us or terminated certain of these ground leases have payments subject to annual escalations andor periodic fair market value adjustments which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority regarding major decisions our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 

we currently do and may continue in the future to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures we have several joint ventures with other real estate investors joint venture investments involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties including the following 

 

at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners we also have in the past and could choose in the future to guarantee part of or all of certain joint venture debt frequently we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction any of these risks could materially and adversely affect 

our ability to generate and recognize attractive returns on our joint venture investments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and distributions to our shareholders 

several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction along with certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures as part of the archstone transaction as well as certain other tax protected properties we have acquired over the years are subject to tax protection agreements which could limit our flexibility with respect to our ownership of such assets or cause us to incur material costs 

several of the assets we acquired from archstone enterprise lp archstone in february 2013 were contributed to archstone subject to various agreements limiting the ability of the owner of the property to take actions that would trigger income tax liability for the contributing owner of the property including a taxable disposition of the property in addition we will also be required to maintain a certain amount of qualified nonrecourse financing on the tax protected properties during their respective restricted periods our obligations relating to these tax protected properties as well as certain other tax protected properties we have acquired over the years may affect the way in which we conduct our business including whether when and under what circumstances we sell properties or interests therein and the timing and nature of our financings and refinancing transactions as a result we may not be able to dispose of or refinance the tax protected properties when to do so may have otherwise been favorable to us and our shareholders which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures as part of the archstone transaction have complex tax requirements that if violated may cause us to be required to indemnify the preferred stockholders or our joint venture partner for certain tax protection costs 

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including but not limited to the following 

 

issuances or sales of our common shares may be dilutive 

  

the issuance or sale of substantial amounts of our common shares whether directly by us or in the secondary market the perception that such issuances or sales of our common shares could occur or the availability for future issuance or sale of our common shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common shares could have a dilutive effect on our actual and expected earnings per share funds from operations “ffo” per share and normalized ffo per share the actual amount of dilution cannot be determined at this time and would be dependent upon numerous factors which are not currently known to us 

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions 

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of regular distributions to our security holders while our current dividend policy makes it less likely that we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate or large portfolio sales occur however whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for additional discussion regarding our dividend policy 

the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company 

from time to time the company holds investment securities andor cash investments that have various levels of repayment and liquidity risk including government obligations and bond funds money market funds or bank deposits on occasion we also may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank substantially exceeds the fdic insurance limit or we invest cash in money market or similar type funds with investment management institutions that may be subject to now or in the future liquidity andor withdrawal restrictions resulting in risk to the company of loss or lack of immediate availability of funds if these banks or institutions fail to meet their obligations 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in our cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of our confidential information andor damage to our reputation and business relationships all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

  

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of our information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information including information regarding our residents and employees as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems both internal and those we have outsourced to third party service providers in addition information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks our primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our reputation damage to our business relationships and private data exposure we have implemented processes procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks but these measures as well as our increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident 

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders 

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer shareholder securities employment environmental development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

  

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

we are aware that some of our properties have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those properties while we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our properties there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property should mold become an issue in the future our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

insurance policies can be costly and may not cover all losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

  

as of december 31 2016  the companys property insurance policies provide for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 earthquake losses are subject to a 2 deductible in the state of washington and a 5 deductible in california applied to the values of the buildings involved in the loss the company also typically selfinsures a substantial portion of the first 50 million of a property loss in excess of these base deductibles should a claim exceed these amounts it would be 100 covered by insurance furthermore the company purchased additional coverage in the event that the company suffers multiple noncatastrophic occurrences with losses from 25 million to 50 million within the same policy year the companys general liability and workers compensation policies at december 31 2016  provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses the company also has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio becoming more concentrated in fewer more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint furthermore the potential impact of climate change increased severe weather or earthquakes could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

the company also has 7500 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses 

as of december 31 2016  the companys cyber liability insurance policy provides for a 50 million policy aggregate limit and a per occurrence deductible of 250000 cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers this cyber policy would cover the cost of victim notification credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses 

the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability and workers compensation insurance while there has yet to be any nonperformance by these major insurance providers should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact the company in addition the company annually assesses its insurance needs based on the cost of coverage and other factors we may choose to self insure a greater portion of this risk in the future or may choose to have higher deductibles or lesser policy terms 

damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events and climate change could result in losses to the company 

certain of our properties are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including fires snow or ice storms windstorms or hurricanes earthquakes flooding or other severe weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future revenue from that property we could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

the inability of lehman to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us under the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction could increase our liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition to certain indemnification obligations of each party to the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction relating to breaches of fundamental representations and warranties and breaches of covenants and certain other specified matters we negotiated as a term in the purchase agreement that lehman brothers holdings inc lehman retain responsibility for and indemnify us against damages resulting from certain thirdparty claims or other liabilities these thirdparty claims and other liabilities include without limitation costs associated with various litigation matters lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in september 2008 and is currently in the process of postpetition liquidation if lehman completes its liquidation prior to the termination of their indemnity obligations to us under the purchase agreement or otherwise distributes substantially all of its assets to its creditors prior to such time lehman may not be able to satisfy its obligations with respect to claims and retained liabilities covered by the purchase agreement the failure of lehman to satisfy such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition because claimants may successfully assert that we are liable for those claims andor retained liabilities in addition we expect that certain obligations of lehman to indemnify us will terminate upon expiration of the applicable indemnification period generally no more than four years following the closing which will be february 27 2017 the assertion of thirdparty claims after the expiration of the applicable indemnification period or the failure of lehman to satisfy its indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

nonperformance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties as a result defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided or volatility in the financial markets could affect counterparties ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

debt financing and preferred sharespreference units could adversely affect our performance 

general 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the companys total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31 2016  

in addition to debt we have a liquidation value of 373 million of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interestpreference units with a dividend preference of 829 per annum as of december 31 2016  our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions 

dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly andor to decline 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance 

through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored enterprises or gses are significant lenders and enhancers of taxexempt bonds both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have an impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our secured borrowings disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit markets perception of the gses which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on our taxexempt debt obligations these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets 

nonperformance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress 

the company also has developed assets with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the revolving credit facility impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders requirements at the lower ratings level 

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the companys debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2016  

financial covenants could adversely affect the companys financial condition 

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our revolving credit facility contains certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our revolving credit facility and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  should it fall out of compliance it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds or otherwise contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions including affordability requirements the company and from time to time its consultants monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities 

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 268 as of december 31 2016  in addition our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows 



  

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

advances under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnerships credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group borrowings under our commercial paper program also bear interest at variable rates certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates or be swapped to a floating rate of interest 

we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders 

derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow 

in the normal course of business we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments including hedging for future debt issuances at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates we may also use derivatives to manage commodity prices in the daily operations of our business there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact these arrangements which can include a number of counterparties may expose us to additional risks including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts and may involve extensive costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate or commodity pricing fluctuations 

we depend on our key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer “ceo” if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 

shareholders ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holders rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the companys ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the companys status as a reit we have issued several of these waivers in the past 

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

  

  

  

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the companys outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

our status as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements in addition certain of our subsidiary entities have elected to be taxed as reits as such each must separately satisfy all of the requirements to qualify for reit status our failure to comply with the complex reit rules at the subsidiary reit level can materially and adversely impact eqrs reit status 

even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status however the reit qualification rules permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status there is also risk that congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income 

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that were the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain we also could 

have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger 

  

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition and our shareholders liquidity 

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company or our shareholders 

under certain circumstances we have made andor may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the internal revenue code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

the internal revenue service has published several rulings that allow reits to offer shareholders the choice of stock or cash with respect to the receipt of a dividend an elective stock dividend however reits are also permitted to limit the amount of cash paid to all shareholders to 20 of the total dividend paid therefore it is possible that the total tax burden to shareholders resulting from an elective stock dividend may exceed the amount of cash received by the shareholder 

federal income tax considerations 

general 

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flowthrough entity for federal income tax purposes 

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholders personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

  

comprehensive tax reform 

the potential enactment of comprehensive us federal tax reform legislation may adversely impact the taxation of the reit its subsidiaries or its shareholders tax reform legislation could result in a material increase in both our federal and state tax liabilities and may change the size and tax character of our distributions in a way that increases our shareholders tax liabilities as compared to current law or requires the company to distribute more than it otherwise would have in addition comprehensive tax reform could increase the complexity of our compliance efforts and increase tax compliance costs and could have a material impact on our operations 

our taxation 

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries engaged in activities which cannot be performed directly by a reit such as condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income generated by these activities in our taxable reit subsidiaries 

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis  amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a “taxable reit subsidiary” or “trs” provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 25 of the reits total asset value 20 for taxable years beginning january 1 2018 trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be 

material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 

 

to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the  de minimis  test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

asset tests  in general on the last day of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets    

   

  

the 10 value test described in clause 3b above does not apply to nonqualified publicly offered reit debt instruments or to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis  change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuers debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis  ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis  exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above and any changes in the federal tax code may not be adopted by the states potentially leading to material tax liabilities for the company and its shareholders consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholders common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholders tax basis such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reits earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

a reit may make an election under the internal revenue code to treat certain dividends that are paid in a taxable year as being made by the reit in the previous taxable year a shareholder is required to include the amount of the dividend in the taxable year that it is paid by the reit 

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year or the amount of distributions treated as dividends for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

generally our designated capital gain dividends will be broken out into net capital gains distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20 for individual taxpayers in the highest tax bracket and unrecaptured section 1250 gain distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

certain us shareholders that are taxed as individuals estates or trusts may also be required to pay an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares 

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

  

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

   

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

  

taxation of foreign shareholders 

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

 

distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

 

if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholders common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholders common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholders united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

  

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

 

under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder other than certain qualified shareholders and qualified foreign pension funds discussed below that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholders united states federal income tax liability 

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition if timely requested foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

foreign shareholders sales of common shares   gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 



 

even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

   

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 15 of the purchase price 

exception to firpta for qualified shareholders   for dispositions and distributions after december 18 2015 stock of a reit held directly or through partnerships by a “qualified shareholder” will not be treated as united states real property interest and capital gain dividends from such a reit will not be treated as gain from the sale of a united states real property interest this exception does not apply to persons that hold an interest taking into account applicable constructive ownership rules more than 10 of the stock of the reit unless that interest is solely as a creditor an “applicable investor” if the qualified shareholder has such an “applicable investor” the portion of reit stock indirectly owned through the qualified shareholder by the applicable investor will be treated as gains from the sale of united states real property interests for these purposes a “qualified shareholder” is a foreign person which is in a treaty jurisdiction and satisfies certain publicly traded requirements is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” and maintains records on the identity of certain 5 owners a “qualified collective investment vehicle” is a foreign person that is eligible for a reduced withholding rate with respect to ordinary reit dividends even if such person holds more than 10 of the reit’s stock a publicly traded partnership that is a withholding foreign partnership that would be a united states real property holding corporation if it were a united states corporation or is designated as a qualified collective investment vehicle by the secretary of the treasury and is either fiscally transparent within the meaning of the code or required to include dividends in its gross income but entitled to a deduction for distribution to its investors finally capital gain dividends and nondividend redemption and liquidating distributions to a qualified shareholder that are not allocable to an applicable investor will be treated as ordinary dividends 

exception to firpta withholding for qualified foreign pension funds   for distributions or disposition of reit stock after december 18 2015 “qualified foreign pension funds” and entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund are exempted from firpta withholding for these purposes a “qualified foreign pension fund” is any trust corporation or other organization or arrangement if i it was created or organized under foreign law ii it was established to provide retirement or pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees of one or more employers in consideration for services rendered iii it does not have a single participant or beneficiary with a right to more than 5 of its assets or income iv it is subject to government regulation and provides annual information reporting about its beneficiaries to the relevant tax authorities in the country in which it is established or operates and v under the laws of the country in which it is established or operates either contributions to such fund which would otherwise be subject to tax under such laws are deductible or excluded from the gross income of such fund or taxed at a reduced rate or taxation of any investment income of such fund is deferred or such income is taxed at a reduced rate 

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such persons united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund 

provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service 

withholding on foreign financial institutions and nonus shareholders 

the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” imposes a us withholding tax at a 30 rate on dividends and on proceeds from the sale of our shares paid beginning january 1 2019 to “foreign financial institutions” as defined under fatca and certain other foreign entities if certain due diligence and disclosure requirements related to us accounts with or ownership of such entities are not satisfied or an exemption does not apply if fatca withholding is imposed nonus beneficial owners that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from or a reduction of us withholding tax with respect to such distributions and sale proceeds would be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction any payment made by us that is subject to withholding under fatca or otherwise will be net of the amount required to be withheld

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

the company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations and appreciation we are focused on the six coastal markets of boston new york washington dc southern california including los angeles orange county and san diego san francisco and seattle these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents 

 we believe our strategy also capitalizes on the increasing preference of renters of all ages to live in the urban core of cities or dense suburban locations near transit entertainment and cultural amenities millennials the 83 million people between ages 18 and 34 are a prime apartment rental demographic reports also show a growing trend among aging baby boomers a demographic of more than 76 million people between the ages of 53 and 71 toward apartment rentals we believe that both groups appreciate the locational values described above as well as the flexibility that rental apartments offer 

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases review their accounts and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture agreements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially occupied properties and may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings 

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio into urban and highly walkable closein suburban assets since 2005 the company has sold nearly 198000 apartment units primarily located in the less dense portion of suburban markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately 235 billion acquired nearly 69000  apartment units primarily located in urban and highdensity suburban markets for approximately 200 billion and began approximately 57 billion  of development projects primarily located in urban and highdensity suburban markets we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets in the following six core coastal metropolitan areas boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle the sale of the starwood portfolio combined with the other 2016 dispositions has resulted in the companys exit from the south florida denver and new england excluding boston markets and has substantially completed the companys portfolio transformation which started approximately ten years ago see further discussion below regarding the companys 2016 disposition activity

current environment 

following the approval by the companys board of trustees the company executed an agreement with controlled affiliates of starwood capital group starwood on october 23 2015 to sell a portfolio of 72 operating properties consisting of 23262 apartment units located in five markets across the united states for 5365 billion the starwood transaction or starwood portfolio on january 26 and 27 2016 the company closed on the sale of the entire portfolio described above the sale of the starwood portfolio combined with the other 2016 dispositions has resulted in the companys exit from the south florida denver and new england excluding boston markets and has substantially completed the companys portfolio transformation which started approximately ten years ago these sales have narrowed the companys focus which is now entirely directed towards our six coastal markets we believe the assets sold will have lower longterm returns as compared to investments in our six coastal markets and that we sold them for prices that are favorable given the strong demand for multifamily assets in our six coastal markets from institutional investors and the challenge in recycling 68 billion of capital in this competitive marketplace the company believed the best riskadjusted use of the sale proceeds was to distribute a portion to our shareholders and use the remainder to repay outstanding debt see further discussion below 

the company used the majority of the proceeds from the starwood transaction and other 2016 dispositions to pay two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of op units of 1100 per shareunit in the aggregate the company paid special dividends of 800 per shareunit approximately 30 billion on march 10 2016 and 300 per shareunit approximately 11 billion on october 14 2016 the company used the majority of the remaining proceeds to reduce aggregate indebtedness in order to make the transaction leverage neutral the company retired approximately 20 billion in secured and unsecured debt the majority of which was scheduled to mature in 2016 and 2017 improving the companys already strong credit metrics 

as a result of the starwood transaction and the other 2016 completed dispositions the companys portfolio has changed significantly from the portfolio summary included in the companys 2015 annual report on form 10k the following table sets forth certain information by market relating to the companys properties at december 31 2016 as compared to december 31 2015 



during the year ended december 31 2016  the company acquired four  consolidated rental properties consisting of 573  apartment units for 2493 million  the company acquired these properties primarily in order to protect the tax status of certain unaffiliated third parties arising from the starwood transaction during the year ended december 31 2016 the company sold 98  consolidated rental properties consisting of 29440  apartment units for 68 billion  which includes the sale of the starwood portfolio described above the company also sold one unconsolidated rental property consisting of 336 apartment units for 745 million with the companys share of the net sales proceeds approximating 124 million in addition the company sold three land parcels for 575 million during the year ended december 31 2016 the company currently budgets consolidated rental acquisitions of approximately 5000 million during the year ending december 31 2017 to be funded with proceeds from rental dispositions the company currently budgets consolidated rental dispositions of approximately 5000 million during the year ending december 31 2017 

  

the company has been reducing its development spending and starts in response to high land prices and low projected returns on investment during the year ended december 31 2016 the company started construction on one project representing 222 apartment units totaling approximately 880 million of development costs and substantially completed construction on five projects representing 2141 apartment units totaling approximately 11 billion of development costs the company currently budgets no development starts during the year ending december 31 2017 we currently budget spending approximately 3000 million on development costs during the year ending december 31 2017 primarily for projects currently under construction we currently anticipate having only 400 million remaining to spend during the year ending december 31 2018 for projects currently under construction we expect that this capital will be primarily sourced with excess operating cash flow future debt offerings and borrowings on our revolving credit facility andor commercial paper program 

we currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets in february 2015 the company entered into a 5000 million commercial paper program which allows for daily weekly or monthly borrowings at low floating rates of interest we believe this commercial paper program allows the 

company to continue to reduce its already low cost of capital and we generally use the program to replace a portion of the amount that otherwise would have been outstanding under our revolving line of credit see further discussion below in october 2016 the company completed a 5000 million unsecured ten year note offering with a coupon of 285 and an allin effective interest rate of approximately 310 the company has budgeted 3000 million to 5000 million of secured or unsecured debt offerings during 2017 excluding usage of the commercial paper program 

on november 3 2016 the company replaced its existing 25 billion facility with a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing january 10 2022 the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 7500 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be libor plus a spread currently 0825  or based on bids received from the lending group and the company pays an annual facility fee currently 125 basis points  both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the companys longterm debt we reduced the size of the facility to reflect the reduction in the size of the company and the prepayment of a significant amount of debt during the first quarter of 2016 in the process we were able to reduce the borrowing costs associated with this facility 

we believe that cash and cash equivalents securities readily convertible to cash excess operating cash flow current availability on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program future debt offerings and disposition proceeds for 2017 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions debt maturities andor prepayments and existing development projects through 2017 we expect that our remaining longerterm funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings equity issuances property dispositions joint ventures and cash generated from operations 

through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac the “government sponsored enterprises” or “gses” are significant lenders and enhancers of taxexempt bonds both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have an impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our secured borrowings the company has access to multiple other forms of public and private capital and over time we would expect that other lenders including banks the commercial mortgagebacked securities market and life insurance companies will become larger sources of secured debt capital to the multifamily market particularly as it relates to the companys high quality apartment properties 

same store revenues increased 37 during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  the full year 2016 results were below our original expectations due primarily to elevated levels of new luxury supply combined with slower job growth in the financial services and technology sectors in the new york and san francisco markets which made up approximately 38 of our noi we anticipate these trends continuing into 2017 and as a result currently estimate same store revenue increases ranging from 100 to 225 for 2017  as compared to 2016  although occupancy rates remain strong across our portfolio increased supply and slowing growth in higher paying jobs in many of our markets causes the company to anticipate revenue growth in 2017 will be lower than 2016 

washington dc continues to slowly and steadily improve driven primarily by strong job growth while the new administration issued a federal hiring freeze we remain confident that demographics will continue to drive strong demand for apartments though new supply levels remain elevated only about onethird of that supply is located in our submarkets we expect continued slow improvement and expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 18 in this market in 2017 

in the new york market elevated deliveries of new luxury supply in the upper west side and brooklyn submarkets are having an impact on our ability to raise rents as renters trend towards affordability over neighborhood loyalty there has also been a reduction in the rate of job growth in the financial services sector and technology sector which are important demand drivers in the market in order to remain competitive with this new supply we offered rent concessions and increased leasing and advertising expenses throughout 2016 and will likely continue to do so during 2017 as a result we expect there to be a decline in same store revenues of approximately 15 in 2017 

we have a cautious outlook for boston as the market continues to feel the impact from an elevated level of deliveries of new supply in the downtown and cambridge submarkets with approximately 75 of this new supply competing with our properties job growth has continued to improve in the market which is a positive sign that the additional supply may be absorbed without significant disruption we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 15 in this market in 2017 

seattle is producing solid rental rate growth strong demand is being driven by the continued growth in technology jobs in the market while new supply remains elevated in this market the strong job growth has enabled that supply to be fully absorbed with little disruption therefore we would expect seattle to perform well through 2017 producing same store revenue growth of 

approximately 425 

san francisco experienced significant volatility during peak leasing season as certain submarkets experienced elevated levels of new luxury supply combined with slower job growth in the technology sector currently the market seems relatively stable though with minimal pricing power on new leases the market still features good demand as evidenced by how rapidly our newly completed development projects are leasing up however consumers have more choices as new supply continues to be delivered into most of our submarkets during 2017 limiting our pricing power as a result we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 10 in this market in 2017 

los angeles is performing well and is positioned to be one of our better performing markets in 2017 widely dispersed new supply very good economic growth and a high level of job growth in the market are driving strong revenue growth we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 36 in this market in 2017 we expect our remaining markets in southern california orange county and san diego to perform slightly better than los angeles 

same store expenses increased 33 during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  the full year 2016 results were slightly worse than our original expectations due to the following items 

 

we anticipate same store expense increases ranging from 30 to 40 for 2017  as compared to 2016  due to the following items 

 

we anticipate same store noi increases ranging from 00 to 20 for 2017  as compared to 2016  as a result of the above same store revenue and expense expectations 

the company expects total overhead costs property management expense and general and administrative expense to decline approximately 30 million in 2017 over 2016 as we have largely completed right sizing our overhead platform to our smaller asset size as certain of the companys overhead costs are fixed andor not quickly scalable the company anticipates overhead costs as a percentage of total revenues will remain elevated as compared to 2015 levels though slightly lower as compared to 2016 levels 

we believe that the company is wellpositioned in the longterm as a result of favorable demographics and increasing consumer preferences for the flexibility of rental housing as of december 31 2016 the companys same store occupancy was 957 and its total portfoliowide occupancy was 946 we believe our marketsmetro areas will continue to see increased luxury multifamily supply especially in our urban core locations and there will continue to be periods of disruption as new development projects lease up we believe over the longer term that our markets will absorb future supply because of the strong longterm demand in these markets as exhibited by our current high occupancy levels and increasing household formations we have seen evidence of this in seattle as elevated levels of new supply have been absorbed and rental rates continue to grow we also anticipate supply declining in our markets beginning in 2018 with the possible exception of new york because of high construction costs lower revenue growth and development lenders materially reducing their lending activities due to regulatory pressures and concerns over markets being overbuilt 

the current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

  

results of operations 

in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy the company continued to invest in apartment properties located in our six coastal markets and sell apartment properties located primarily in the less dense portion of suburban markets during the years ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  in summary we

year ended december 31 2015  

 

the companys primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less direct property operating expenses including real estate taxes and insurance the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the companys apartment properties 

  

the definitions of certain terms described above are as follows 



company and ii the gross sales price net of selling costs offset by iii the undepreciated capital cost of the properties at the time of sale and iv total direct property operating expenses including real estate taxes and insurance incurred during the period owned by the company each of the items i ii iii and iv is calculated in accordance with gaap 

properties that the company owned and were stabilized see definition below for all of both 2016  and 2015  the “ 2016  same store properties” which represented 69879 apartment units impacted the companys results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2015  and 2014  the “ 2015  same store properties” which represented 96286 apartment units also impacted the companys results of operations both the 2016  same store properties and 2015  same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

the following tables provide a rollforward of the apartment units included in same store properties and a reconciliation of apartment units included in same store properties to those included in total properties for the year ended december 31 2016  





note properties are considered stabilized when they have achieved 90 occupancy for three consecutive months properties are included in same store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented 

 

the companys acquisition disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  the impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following 

paragraphs 

  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2016  to the year ended december 31 2015   

  

for the year ended december 31 2016  the company reported diluted earnings per shareunit of 1168  compared to 236  per shareunit for the year ended december 31 2015  the difference is primarily due to approximately 37 billion in higher gains on property sales and lower depreciation expense in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a direct result of the significant sales activity in 2016 partially offset by significantly higher debt extinguishment costs in 2016 compared to 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2016  income from continuing operations increased approximately 36 billion  when compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the increase in continuing operations is discussed below 

  

for the year ended december 31 2016  consolidated rental income decreased 115 consolidated operating expenses comprising of property and maintenance and real estate taxes and insurance decreased 116 and consolidated noi decreased 115 when compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the declines are all primarily a result of the companys significant disposition activity in 2016 

  

revenues from the 2016  same store properties increased 781 million  primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents expenses from the 2016  same store properties increased 202 million  primarily as a result of an increase in real estate taxes onsite payroll costs repairs and maintenance expenses and leasing and advertising expenses partially offset by lower utility costs the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2016  same store properties

        and association and business licensing fees 

the following tables present reconciliations of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to noi along with rental income operating expenses and noi per the consolidated statements of operations allocated between same store and nonsame store results 



for properties that the company acquired or completed that were stabilized prior to january 1 2016  and that the company expects to continue to own through december 31 2017  the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2017  



the company anticipates consolidated rental acquisitions of 5000 million and consolidated rental dispositions of 5000 million and expects that the acquisition cap rate will be 075 lower than the disposition yield for the full year ending december 31 2017  

  

these 2017  assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

nonsame store noi results decreased  approximately 2775 million compared to the same period in 2015 and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2015  and 2016  operations from the company’s development properties and operations prior to disposition from 2016 sold properties including the starwood portfolio this decrease  primarily resulted from 



operating properties acquired in 2015 and 2016 of 152 million 

see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s segment disclosures 

fee and asset management revenues decreased approximately 48 million  or 575  primarily as a result of lower revenue earned on management of the companys military housing ventures at joint base lewis mcchord due to the sale of the companys entire interest in the management contracts and related rights associated with these ventures in the second quarter of 2016 as well as lower fees earned on management of the companys unconsolidated joint ventures 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses decreased approximately 42 million or 49  this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in payrollrelated costs office rent and education conference fees partially offset by increases in computer operations costs the company anticipates that property management expenses will approximate 830 million to 850 million for the year ending december 31 2017 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses decreased approximately 68 million or 106 primarily due to a decrease in payrollrelated costs partially offset by an increase in directors fees and office rent the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 500 million to 520 million for the year ending december 31 2017 excluding charges of approximately 04 million related to the companys current executive compensation program the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets decreased approximately 602 million or 79  primarily as a result of no depreciation or a partial period of depreciation expense during the year ended december 31 2016 related to the significant property sales in 2016 including the starwood portfolio partially offset by additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2016 and development properties placed in service 

interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately 584 million  primarily due to the approximate 524 million gain from the sale of the companys entire interest in the management contracts and related rights associated with the military housing ventures at joint base lewis mcchord and approximate 60 million gain from the sale of 421a real estate tax certificates during the year ended december 31 2016 neither of which occurred in 2015 the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate 05 million for the year ending december 31 2017 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately 74 million  primarily due to increases in litigationenvironmental reserve andor settlement costs property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the companys 2016 acquisitions and the expensing of overhead pursuit cost writeoffs as a result of fewer new development opportunities 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 396 million or 87  primarily as a result of prepayment penalties and debt extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of approximately 17 billion in debt principal prior to scheduled maturity partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of these repayments during the year ended december 31 2016 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 515 million as compared to 599 million for the year ended december 31 2015 this capitalization of interest relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2016 was 468 as compared to 472 for the year ended december 31 2015 the company anticipates that interest expense from continuing operations excluding debt extinguishment costsprepayment penalties will approximate 3626 million to 3790 million and capitalized interest will approximate 230 million to 280 million for the year ending december 31 2017 the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately 07 million or 759  primarily due to increases in various state and local taxes related to the companys elevated disposition activity in 2016 vs 2015 the company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate 05 million to 15 million for the year ending december 31 2017 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

income from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 102 million  or 680 primarily due to 186 million in favorable litigation settlements which occurred during the year ended december 31 2015 partially offset by a gain on the sale of one unconsolidated apartment property totaling 88 million which occurred during the year ended december 31 2016 

net gain on sales of real estate properties increased approximately 37 billion  as a result of the sale of 98 consolidated apartment properties including the starwood portfolio during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to only eight consolidated apartment property sales during the year ended december 31 2015 all of which did not meet the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

net gain on sales of land parcels increased approximately 157 million  due to the gain on sale of three land parcels during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to no land sales during the year ended december 31 2015 

discontinued operations net increased approximately 01 million  or 305 between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily due to the timing of trailing activity for properties sold in 2013 and prior years the company adopted the new discontinued operations standard effective january 1 2014 and as a result none of the properties sold during the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015 met the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2014 

  

for the year ended december 31 2015 the company reported diluted earnings per shareunit of 236 compared to 173 per shareunit for the year ended december 31 2014 the difference is primarily due to approximately 1223 million in higher gains on property sales as well as improved operations in 2015 vs 2014 

for the year ended december 31 2015 income from continuing operations increased approximately 2505 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the increase in continuing operations is discussed below 

revenues from the 2015 same store properties increased 1253 million primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents higher occupancy and a decrease in turnover expenses from the 2015 same store properties increased 205 million primarily due to increases in real estate taxes repairs and maintenance expenses and payrollproperty management costs partially offset by lower utility costs the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2015 same store properties

nonsame store operating results increased approximately 45 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2014 and 2015 as well as operations from the company’s completed development properties this increase primarily resulted from 

 

see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s segment disclosures

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased approximately 11 million or 13 this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payrollrelated costs and educationconferences fees 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 140 million or 276 primarily due to an increase in payrollrelated costs including an additional 80 million related to the companys revised executive compensation program 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 70 million or 09 primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2014 and 2015 development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned partially offset by no depreciation or a partial period of depreciation expense during the year ended december 31 2015 for properties sold in 2015 and 2014 and properties classified as held for sale at december 31 2015 

interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately 29 million or 652 primarily due to the settlement of various litigationinsurance claims during the year ended december 31 2015 

other expenses from continuing operations decreased approximately 61 million or 676 primarily due to litigation settlement costs recorded during the year ended december 31 2014 that did not reoccur in 2015 as well as a reduction in the reserve for a litigation matter recorded during the year ended december 31 2015 partially offset by an increase in the expensing of overhead pursuit cost writeoffs as a result of a more active focus on sourcing new development opportunities 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 133 million or 28 primarily as a result of the repayment of 3000 million of 6584 unsecured notes in april 2015 the repayment of 5000 million of 525 unsecured notes in september 2014 the repayment of the companys 7500 million unsecured term loan facility in june 2014 mortgage payoffs and higher capitalized interest partially offset by interest expense on 7500 million of unsecured notes that closed in may 2015 and 12 billion of unsecured notes that closed in june 2014 during the year ended december 31 2015 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 599 million as compared to 528 million for the year ended december 31 2014 this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2015 was 472 as compared to 474 for the year ended   december 31 2014    

income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately 05 million or 342 primarily due to decreases in estimated taxes related to properties sold andor operated by the companys trs in 2015 vs 2014   

income from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately 230 million primarily due to gains on the sale of certain assets owned by the companys joint ventures with a joint venture partner and due to 186 million in favorable litigation settlements neither of which occurred during the year ended december 31 2014 

net gain on sales of real estate properties increased approximately 1224 million or 576 as a result of higher gains on the sale of eight consolidated apartment properties during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to ten consolidated property sales during the year ended december 31 2014 all of which did not meet the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately 53 million due to the gain on sale of three land parcels during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to no land sales during the year ended december 31 2015 

discontinued operations net decreased approximately 12 million or 749 between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily due to the companys adoption of the new discontinued operations standard effective january 1 2014 none of the properties sold during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 met the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations and as a result the amounts included in discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 represent trailing activity for properties sold in 2013 and prior years see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

note the company recorded approximately 243 and 86 million of net debt discountdeferred derivative settlement amortization as additional interest expense during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 



 

the following table provides a summary of the company’s unsecured debt as of december 31 2016  



 

eqr and erpop currently have an active universal shelf registration statement for the issuance of equity and debt securities that automatically became effective upon filing with the sec on june 28 2016 and expires on june 28 2019 per the terms of erpops partnership agreement eqr contributes the net proceeds of all equity offerings to the capital of erpop in exchange for additional op units on a oneforone common share per op unit basis or preference units on a oneforone preferred share per preference unit basis 

the company’s “consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio” as of december 31 2016  is presented in the following table the company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of i the total outstanding common shares and assumed conversion of all units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the company’s common shares on the new york stock exchange and ii the liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares outstanding 





the operating partnership’s “consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio” as of december 31 2016 is presented in the following table the operating partnership calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of i the total outstanding units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the company’s common shares on the new york stock exchange and ii the liquidation value of all perpetual preference units outstanding 





the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility and commercial paper program under normal operating conditions the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions 

the company has a flexible dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the company’s core business and provide transparency to investors beginning in 2014 the company began paying its annual dividend based on 65 of the midpoint of the range of normalized ffo guidance customarily provided as part of the companys fourth quarter earnings release the companys 2016 regular annual dividend payout was 2015 per shareunit and the company paid four regular quarterly dividends of 050375 per shareunit in 2016 in addition to the regular quarterly dividends the company paid two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of op units of 1100 per shareunit in the aggregate the company paid special dividends of 800 per shareunit approximately 30 billion on march 10 2016 and 300 per shareunit approximately 11 billion on october 14 2016 all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the board of trustees 

while our current dividend policy makes it less likely that we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate or large portfolio sales occur however whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature the companys financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels the company believes that its expected 2017  operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and regular dividendsdistributions 

the company also expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as lump sum unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities including additional op units proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and cash generated from operations after all distributions in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes line of credit and commercial paper program of the 254 billion in investment in real estate on the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2016  187 billion or 738 was unencumbered however there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise 

erpops longterm senior debt ratings and shortterm commercial paper ratings as well as eqrs longterm preferred equity ratings as of february 17 2017 are as follows 



 

the longterm ratings listed above were reaffirmed following the companys announcement of the starwood transaction and other 2016 dispositions 

on november 3 2016 the company replaced its existing 25 billion facility with a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing january 10 2022 the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 7500 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be libor plus a spread currently 0825  or based on bids received from the lending group and the company pays an annual facility fee currently 125 basis points  both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the companys longterm debt 

  

the companys previous 25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility was set to mature on april 2 2018 the company had the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 5000 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on advances under the facility was generally libor plus a spread was 095 at termination or based on bids received from the lending group and the company paid an annual facility fee was 15 basis points at termination both the spread and the facility fee were dependent on the credit rating of the company’s longterm debt 

on february 2 2015 the company entered into an unsecured commercial paper note program in the united states the company may borrow up to a maximum of 5000 million under this program subject to market conditions the notes will be sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the companys other unsecured senior indebtedness the company does not intend to borrow more than 20 billion on the commercial paper program and new revolving credit facility combined as of february 17 2017 there was a balance of 1000 million  outstanding on the commercial paper program 

as of february 17 2017  no amounts were outstanding and the amount available on the revolving credit facility was 188 billion net of 206 million  which was restricteddedicated to support letters of credit and net of the 1000 million  outstanding on the commercial paper program this facility may among other potential uses be used to fund property acquisitions costs for certain properties under development and shortterm liquidity requirements 

see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to december 31 2016  

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate 

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories 

 

all replacements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 

 

all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset 

  

for the year ended december 31 2016  our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1722 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 



 

for the year ended december 31 2015 our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1821 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 



 

the company estimates that during 2017 it will spend approximately 2600 per apartment unit of capital expenditures inclusive of apartment unit renovationrehab costs or 1900 per apartment unit excluding apartment unit renovationrehab costs during 2017  the company expects to spend approximately 500 million for all unit renovationrehab costs primarily on same store properties at a weighted average cost of 11000 per apartment unit rehabbed these anticipated amounts represent an 

increase as a percentage of rental revenues in the cost per unit and in the absolute dollar amounts over 2016 these increases include approximately 170 million of additional estimated expenditures for resident focused renovation projects such as common areas and exercise rooms in order to remain competitive with the new luxury supply being delivered in many of our markets we will continue to create value from our properties by doing those rehabs that meet our investment parameters the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

  

during the year ended december 31 2016  the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 57 million the company expects to fund approximately 31 million in total nonreal estate capital additions in 2017  these anticipated fundings represent a decrease over 2016 which is primarily driven by the substantial completion of the implementation of new systems during 2016 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

capital expenditures to real estate and nonreal estate capital additions are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow 

derivative instruments 

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments the company may also use derivatives to manage commodity prices in the daily operations of the business 

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place 

see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31 2016  

other 

total distributions paid in january 2017  amounted to 1923 million excluding distributions on partially owned properties which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2016  

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

the company has various unconsolidated interests in certain joint ventures the company does not believe that these unconsolidated investments have a materially different impact on its liquidity cash flows capital resources credit or market risk than its consolidated operating andor other activities 

operating properties

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements 

the company’significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2016  and are consistent with the year ended december 31 2015  

the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the five critical accounting policies are 

acquisition of investment properties 

the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 

impairment of longlived assets 

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions and legal and environmental concerns as well as the company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

depreciation of investment in real estate 

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 15year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacement components over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

  

cost capitalization 

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate  section for a discussion of the company’s policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as increases to depreciable property 

  

for all development projects the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and 

payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as constructioninprogress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 

during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  the company capitalized 187 million  223 million  and 224 million  respectively of payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of development activities as well as major capital andor renovation projects 

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates and changes in the securities industry and financial markets association sifma index for taxexempt debt the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program the floating rate taxexempt debt and the fair value hedges that convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt as well as exposure on the refinancing of its debt the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment to the extent the company carries substantial cash balances this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured debt including its commercial paper were approximately 42 billion and 50 billion respectively at december 31 2016  

at december 31 2016  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 11 billion or 123 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 11 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 13 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 11 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 13 million 

at december 31 2016  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 79 billion  or 877  of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 49 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 72 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 49 basis points a 10 decrease 

from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 88 billion 

at december 31 2016  the company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 19 million    if market rates of interest permanently increased by 24 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 04 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 24 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 34 million 

  

at december 31 2015  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 15 billion or 141 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 8 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 12 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 8 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 12 million 

at december 31 2015  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 94 billion or 859 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 51 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 86 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 51 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 105 billion 

at december 31 2015  the company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 30 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 17 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 18 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 17 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 42 million 

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases review their accounts and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture agreements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales the company may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings

competition 

all of the companys properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the companys ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the companys managers in addition other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors for additional information with respect to competition

environmental considerations 

see item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

general 

references to eqr mean equity residential a maryland real estate investment trust reit and references to erpop mean erp operating limited partnership an illinois limited partnership unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “company” “we” “us” or “our” mean collectively eqr erpop and those entitiessubsidiaries owned or controlled by eqr andor erpop and the term “operating partnership” means collectively erpop and those entitiessubsidiaries owned or controlled by erpop this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units op units restricted units formerly known as longterm incentive plan ltip units and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own such securities as our “security holders” 

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 

general 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value these factors include changes in the global national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes all of which could increase over time these operating expenses could rise faster than our revenues causing our income to decline in circumstances where we buy or sell portfolios of properties including large portfolios overhead property management expense and general and administrative expense may not increasedecrease proportionally with the associated changes in revenue sources of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

  

when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing increasing portions of single family housing stock being converted to rental use rental housing subsidized by the government other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing governmental regulations slow or negative employment growth and household formation the availability of lowinterest mortgages or the availability of mortgages requiring little or no down payment for single family home buyers changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond our control in addition various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents finally the federal governments policies many of which may encourage home ownership can increase competition and possibly limit our ability to raise rents consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 

the retailcommercial space at our properties primarily serves as an additional amenity for our residents the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases generally five to ten years with market based renewal options and the characteristics of many of our tenants generally small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition the revenues from our retailcommercial space represent approximately 4 of our total rental income 

we have increased our concentration of properties in our core markets which could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely affected by economic or other conditions 

over the past ten years the company has exited its low barrier to entrynoncore markets as part of its strategy to reposition its portfolio to high barrier to entrycore markets leaving the company highly concentrated in its six core markets if any one or more of our core markets boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle is adversely affected by local or regional economic conditions such as business layoffs industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors or local real estate conditions such as oversupply of or reduced demand for multifamily properties such conditions may have an increased adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions we may be unable to consummate such dispositions in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

new acquisitions development projects andor rehabs may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

we intend to actively acquire develop and rehab multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues andor lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions or higher than expected operating expenses we may not be able to achieve rents that are consistent with expectations for acquired developed or rehabbed properties we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position to complete a development property or to complete a rehab additionally we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts this competition or lack thereof may increase or depress prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure the total number of apartment units under development costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

in connection with such government regulation we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance 

development and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs and as a result we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities the occupancy rates and rents at a property may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development 

by competitors of competing properties we may be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities 

we own certain properties subject to ground leases that may limit our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated 

the company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under several longterm ground leases these ground leases may impose limitations on our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties impair the properties value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable residents for the properties in addition we could lose our interests in the properties if the ground leases are breached by us or terminated certain of these ground leases have payments subject to annual escalations andor periodic fair market value adjustments which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority regarding major decisions our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 

we currently do and may continue in the future to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures a portion of the assets acquired in the archstone transaction were acquired through joint ventures with avb that neither we nor avb control solely we have several joint ventures with other real estate investors joint venture investments including the joint ventures with avb involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties including the following 

 

at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners we also have in the past and could choose in the future to guarantee part of or all of certain joint venture debt frequently we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate and recognize attractive returns on our joint venture investments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and distributions to our shareholders 

several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction along with certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures with avb as part of the archstone transaction are subject to tax protection agreements which could limit our flexibility with respect to our ownership of such assets or cause us to incur material costs 

several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction were contributed to archstone subject to various agreements limiting the ability of the owner of the property to take actions that would trigger income tax liability for the contributing owner of the property including a taxable disposition of the property in addition we will also be required to maintain a certain amount of qualified nonrecourse financing on the tax protected properties during their respective restricted periods our obligations relating to the tax protected properties may affect the way in which we conduct our business including whether when and under what circumstances we sell properties or interests therein and the timing and nature of our financings and refinancing transactions as a result we may not be able to dispose of or refinance the tax protected properties when to do so may have otherwise been favorable to us and our shareholders which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures with avb as part of the archstone transaction have complex tax requirements that if violated may cause us to be required to indemnify the preferred stockholders or avb for certain tax protection costs 

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including but not limited to the following 

 

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions 

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of regular distributions to our security holders while our current dividend policy makes it less likely that we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate or large portfolio sales occur however whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels see item 7 page 55 for additional discussion regarding our dividend policy 

the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company 

from time to time the company holds investment securities andor cash investments that have various levels of repayment and liquidity risk including government obligations and bond funds money market funds or bank deposits on occasion we also may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank substantially exceeds the fdic insurance limit or we invest cash in money market or similar type funds with investment management institutions that may be subject to now or in the future liquidity restrictions resulting in risk to the company of loss or lack of immediate availability of funds if these banks or institutions fail to meet their obligations 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in our cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of our confidential information andor damage to our reputation and business relationships all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

  

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of our information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information including information regarding our residents and employees as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems both internal and those we have outsourced to third party service providers in addition information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks our primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our reputation damage to our business relationships and private data exposure we have implemented processes procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks but these measures as well as our increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident 

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders 

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer shareholder employment environmental development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

we are aware that some of our properties have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those properties while we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our properties there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property should mold become an issue in the future our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

insurance policies can be costly and may not cover all losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

  

as of december 31 2015  the companys property insurance policies provide for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 any earthquake and named windstorm losses in critical areas are subject to a deductible of 5 of the values of the buildings involved in the losses the company also typically selfinsures a substantial portion of the first 50 million of a property loss in excess of these base deductibles should a claim exceed these amounts it would be 100 covered by insurance furthermore the company purchased additional coverage in the event that the company suffers multiple noncatastrophic occurrences with losses from 25 million to 50 million within the same policy year the companys general liability and workers compensation policies at december 31 2015  provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses the company also has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio becoming more concentrated in fewer more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint furthermore the potential impact of climate change increased severe weather or earthquakes could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

the company also has 7500 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses 

as of december 31 2015  the companys cyber liability insurance policy provides for a 50 million policy aggregate limit and a per occurrence deductible of 250000 cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers this cyber policy would cover the cost of victim notification credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses 

the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability and workers compensation insurance while there has yet to be any nonperformance by these major insurance providers should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact the company in addition the company annually assesses its insurance needs based on the cost of coverage and other factors we may choose to self insure a greater portion of this risk in the future or may choose to have higher deductibles or lesser policy terms 

damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events and climate change could result in losses to the company 

certain of our properties are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including fires snow or ice storms windstorms or hurricanes earthquakes flooding or other severe weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future revenue from that property we could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located we may experience 

extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

the inability of lehman to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us under the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction could increase our liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition to certain indemnification obligations of each party to the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction relating to breaches of fundamental representations and warranties and breaches of covenants and certain other specified matters we negotiated as a term in the purchase agreement that lehman retain responsibility for and indemnify us against damages resulting from certain thirdparty claims or other liabilities these thirdparty claims and other liabilities include without limitation costs associated with various litigation matters lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in september 2008 and is currently in the process of postpetition liquidation if lehman completes its liquidation prior to the termination of their indemnity obligations to us under the purchase agreement or otherwise distributes substantially all of its assets to its creditors prior to such time lehman may not be able to satisfy its obligations with respect to claims and retained liabilities covered by the purchase agreement the failure of lehman to satisfy such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition because claimants may successfully assert that we are liable for those claims andor retained liabilities in addition we expect that certain obligations of lehman to indemnify us will terminate upon expiration of the applicable indemnification period generally no more than four years following the closing the assertion of thirdparty claims after the expiration of the applicable indemnification period or the failure of lehman to satisfy its indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

nonperformance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties as a result defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided or volatility in the financial markets could affect counterparties ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

debt financing and preferred sharespreference units could adversely affect our performance 

general 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the companys total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31 2015  

in addition to debt we have a liquidation value of 373 million of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interestpreference units with a dividend preference of 829 per annum as of december 31 2015  our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions 

dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly andor to decline 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance 

through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored enterprises or gses are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have an impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit markets perception of the gses which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets 

nonperformance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress 

the company also has developed assets with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the revolving credit facility impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders requirements at the lower ratings level 

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the companys debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2015  

financial covenants could adversely affect the companys financial condition 

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facility contains certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants 

including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  should it fall out of compliance it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds or otherwise contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions including affordability requirements the company and from time to time its consultants monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities 

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 262 as of december 31 2015  in addition our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows 



  

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

advances under our credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnerships credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group borrowings under our commercial paper program also bear interest at variable rates certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates or be swapped to a floating rate of interest we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders 

derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow 

in the normal course of business we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments including hedging for future debt issuances at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates we may also use derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates or manage commodity prices in the daily operations of our business there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact these arrangements which can include a number of counterparties may expose us to additional risks including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts and may involve extensive costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate foreign exchange or commodity pricing fluctuations 

we depend on our key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer “ceo” if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements 

with the company 

shareholders ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holders rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the companys ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the companys status as a reit we have issued several of these waivers in the past 

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the companys outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

our status as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged 

in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status however the reit qualification rules permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status there is also risk that congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income 

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that were the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger 

  compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition and our shareholders liquidity 

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company or our shareholders 

in past years we have made and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the internal revenue code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

the internal revenue service has published several rulings that allow reits to offer shareholders the choice of stock or cash with respect to the receipt of a dividend an elective stock dividend however reits are also permitted to limit the amount of cash paid to all shareholders to 20 of the total dividend paid therefore it is possible that the total tax burden to shareholders resulting from an elective stock dividend may exceed the amount of cash received by the shareholder 

federal income tax considerations 

general 

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flowthrough entity for federal income tax purposes 

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholders personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

recent legislation 

on december 18 2015 president obama signed into law the consolidated appropriations act 2016 an omnibus spending bill with a division referred to as the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the “path act” the path act modifies a number of important rules regarding the taxation of reits and their shareholders none of which however should materially impact us or our operations the relevant rules are incorporated in the following sections 

our taxation 

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries engaged in activities which cannot be performed directly by a reit such as condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income generated by these activities in our taxable reit subsidiaries 

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis  amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a “taxable reit subsidiary” or “trs” provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 25 of the reits total asset value 20 for taxable years beginning january 1 2018 trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 

 

to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental 

income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the  de minimis  test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

asset tests  in general on the last day of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets    

   

the 10 value test described in clause 3b above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis  change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuers debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis  ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis  exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholders common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholders tax basis such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reits earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

a reit may make an election under the internal revenue code to treat certain dividends that are paid in a taxable year as being made by the reit in the previous taxable year a shareholder is required to include the amount of the dividend in the taxable year that it is paid by the reit 

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year or the amount of distributions 

treated as dividends for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

generally our designated capital gain dividends will be broken out into net capital gains distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20 for individual taxpayers in the highest tax bracket and unrecaptured section 1250 gain distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

certain us shareholders that are taxed as individuals estates or trusts may also be required to pay an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares 

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

   

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

  

  

taxation of foreign shareholders 

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

 

distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

 

if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholders common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholders common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholders united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 10 of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report such distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

  

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

 28 

 

under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholders united states federal income tax liability 

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition if timely requested foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

foreign shareholders sales of common shares   gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

 

even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

   

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 15 of the purchase price 

exception to firpta for qualified shareholders   for dispositions and distributions after december 18 2015 stock of a reit held directly or through partnerships by a “qualified shareholder” will not be treated as united states real property interest and capital gain dividends from such a reit will not be treated as gain from the sale of a united states real property interest this exception does not apply to persons that hold an interest taking into account applicable constructive ownership rules more than 10 of the stock of the reit unless that interest is solely as a creditor an “applicable investor” if the qualified shareholder has such an “applicable investor” the portion of reit stock indirectly owned through the qualified shareholder by 

the applicable investor will be treated as gains from the sale of united states real property interests for these purposes a “qualified shareholder” is a foreign person which is in a treaty jurisdiction and satisfies certain publicly traded requirements is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” and maintains records on the identity of certain 5 owners a “qualified collective investment vehicle” is a foreign person that is eligible for a reduced withholding rate with respect to ordinary reit dividends even if such person holds more than 10 of the reit’s stock a publicly traded partnership that is a withholding foreign partnership that would be a united states real property holding corporation if it were a united states corporation or is designated as a qualified collective investment vehicle by the secretary of the treasury and is either fiscally transparent within the meaning of the code or required to include dividends in its gross income but entitled to a deduction for distribution to its investors finally capital gain dividends and nondividend redemption and liquidating distributions to a qualified shareholder that are not allocable to an applicable investor will be treated as ordinary dividends 

exception to firpta withholding for qualified foreign pension funds   for distributions or disposition of reit stock after december 18 2015 “qualified foreign pension funds” and entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund are exempted from firpta withholding for these purposes a “qualified foreign pension fund” is any trust corporation or other organization or arrangement if i it was created or organized under foreign law ii it was established to provide retirement or pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees of one or more employers in consideration for services rendered iii it does not have a single participant or beneficiary with a right to more than 5 of its assets or income iv it is subject to government regulation and provides annual information reporting about its beneficiaries to the relevant tax authorities in the country in which it is established or operates and v under the laws of the country in which it is established or operates either contributions to such fund which would otherwise be subject to tax under such laws are deductible or excluded from the gross income of such fund or taxed at a reduced rate or taxation of any investment income of such fund is deferred or such income is taxed at a reduced rate 

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such persons united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service 

withholding on foreign financial institutions and nonus shareholders 

the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” imposes a us withholding tax at a 30 rate on dividends and on proceeds from the sale of our shares paid beginning january 1 2019 to “foreign financial institutions” as defined under fatca and certain other foreign entities if certain due diligence and disclosure requirements related to us accounts with or ownership of such entities are not satisfied or an exemption does not apply if fatca withholding is imposed nonus beneficial owners that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from or a reduction of us withholding tax with respect to such distributions and sale proceeds would be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction any payment made by us that is subject to withholding under fatca or otherwise will be net of the amount required to be withheld

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

the company invests in high quality apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations and appreciation we are focused on the six core coastal high barrier to entry markets of boston new york washington dc southern california including los angeles orange county and san diego san francisco and seattle these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents 

 

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases review their accounts and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture agreements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales the company may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings

current environment 

following the approval by the companys board of trustees the company executed an agreement with controlled affiliates of starwood capital group starwood on october 23 2015 to sell a portfolio of 72 operating properties consisting of 23262 apartment units located in five markets across the united states for 5365 billion the starwood transaction on january 26 and 27 2016 the company closed on the sale of all of the portfolio described above the sale of the starwood portfolio combined with other planned 2016 dispositions will result in the companys planned exit from the south florida denver and phoenix markets as well as certain new england submarkets the company intends to use the majority of the proceeds from the starwood transaction and other planned 2016 dispositions to pay two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of op units of between 1000 and 1200 per shareunit in the aggregate on february 22 2016 the board of trustees declared a special dividend of 800 per shareunit to be paid on march 10 2016 to shareholdersunitholders of record as of march 3 2016 the company expects to pay an additional special dividend of approximately 200 to 400 per shareunit later in 2016 all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the companys board of trustees the company used and expects to use the majority of the remaining proceeds to reduce aggregate indebtedness in order to make the transaction leverage neutral the company has retired approximately 17 billion in secured and unsecured debt prior to scheduled maturity in early 2016 and expects to retire an additional 2712 million at par at maturity in march 2016 using cash from these sales the company may also sell certain other assets in core markets in 2016 with the intention of reinvesting the proceeds from those sales in other assets in our core markets these sales will narrow the companys focus which will now be entirely directed towards our high barrier to entrycore markets and will essentially complete the companys portfolio reconfiguration which started approximately ten years ago we believe the assets being sold will have lower longterm returns as compared to investments in our high barrier to entrycore markets and that we can sell them now for prices that we believe are favorable given the very strong bids for multifamily assets in our high barrier to entrycore markets from many different segments of the investment community the company believes the best riskadjusted use of the sale proceeds is to distribute a portion to our shareholders and repay outstanding debt the planned 2016 dispositions discussed above other than the starwood transaction are subject to certain closing conditions and there can be no assurance that such sales will occur 

during the year ended december 31 2015  the company acquired four  consolidated rental properties consisting of 625  apartment units for 2960 million  and three  contiguous land parcels for 278 million  the company sold eight  consolidated rental properties consisting of 1857  apartment units for 5133 million  which included a 193230 square foot medical office building adjacent to our longfellow place property in boston with a sales price of approximately 1233 million during the year ended december 31 2015  the company currently budgets consolidated rental acquisitions of approximately 6000 million during the year ending december 31 2016  to be funded with proceeds from rental dispositions the company currently budgets consolidated rental dispositions of approximately 74 billion during the year ending december 31 2016  which includes the sale of the starwood portfolio and the other planned 2016 dispositions discussed above 

  

during the year ended december 31 2015  the company started construction on two  projects representing 623  apartment units totaling approximately 3772 million  of development costs and substantially completed construction on seven projects representing 1546 apartment units totaling approximately 8351 million of development costs the company significantly increased its development starts in 2014 as compared to preceding years and while construction activity remained elevated in 2015 starts have returned to more historical levels approximately 3000 million to 5000 million on average annually the 

company has budgeted starting approximately 3500 million of new development projects in 2016 we currently budget spending approximately 6000 million on development costs during the year ending december 31 2016  we expect that this capital will be primarily sourced with excess operating cash flow disposition proceeds expected debt offerings in 2016 and borrowings on our revolving credit facility andor commercial paper program 

we currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets in february 2015 the company entered into a 5000 million commercial paper program which allows for daily weekly or monthly borrowings at low floating rates of interest we believe this commercial paper program allows the company to continue to reduce its already low cost of capital and we will use the program to replace a portion of the amount that otherwise would have been outstanding under our revolving line of credit in may 2015 the company completed a 4500 million unsecured ten year note offering with a coupon of 3375 and an allin effective interest rate of approximately 381 as well as a 3000 million unsecured thirty year note offering with a coupon of 45 and an allin effective interest rate of approximately 455 the company used the proceeds from these offerings to repay the outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program the company has budgeted 2000 million to 2500 million of secured or unsecured debt offerings during 2016  excluding usage of the commercial paper program 

we believe that cash and cash equivalents securities readily convertible to cash current availability on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program expected debt offerings and disposition proceeds for 2016  will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions debt maturities existing development projects and special dividends through 2016  we expect that our remaining longerterm funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings equity issuances property dispositions joint ventures and cash generated from operations 

through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac the “government sponsored enterprises” or “gses” are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have an impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings the company has access to multiple other forms of public and private capital and over time we would expect that other lenders including banks the commercial mortgagebacked securities market and life insurance companies will become larger sources of debt capital to the multifamily market particularly as it relates to the companys high quality apartment properties 

same store revenues increased 51 during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  which was above the high end of our original guidance range of 375 to 450 that we provided in february 2015  strong demand and continued strength in occupancy levels drove the outperformance during 2015  which should continue into 2016  in addition improving labor markets robust household formation and declining single family home ownership levels should keep demand for rental housing high and produce above trend growth for 2016  we anticipate same store revenue increases ranging from 450 to 525 and same store noi increases ranging from 500 to 650 for 2016  as compared to 2015  

as noted above demand for our apartments has been strong with high occupancy and low turnover in general new supply continues to be absorbed in an orderly fashion with leaseups occurring faster than expected and only minimal impact on rents at nearby stabilized assets for 2016  we currently anticipate three groupings of same store revenue growth with san francisco seattle los angeles san diego and orange county producing 5 or higher new york and boston producing 3 to 5 and washington dc producing 1 to 13 growth 

washington dc which is our largest market has seen record absorption despite anemic job growth in 2014 and 2015 however we have noted recent improvements in professional services hiring we expect continued slow improvement in the washington dc market throughout 2016 but growth will still lag the remainder of the companys portfolio due to continuing substantial deliveries of new supply in the market combined with modest but recently improving job growth due to weakness in government hiring and spending despite the issues noted in washington dc our business in general continues to perform well because of the combined forces of demographics household formations and increasing consumer preference for the flexibility of rental housing all of which should ensure a continued strong demand for rental housing 

same store expenses increased 25 during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  which was at the low end of our original guidance range of 25 to 35 that we provided in february 2015  primarily due to a decline in the price of commodities and high temperatures which resulted in a decrease in utility costs due to declines in natural gas electricity and heating oil the company anticipates that 2016  same store expenses will increase 25 to 35 with increases in real estate taxes expected to approximate 525 for the full year 2016  the anticipated increase in real estate taxes is primarily due to rate and value increases in certain states and municipalities reflecting those states and municipalities continued economic challenges and the dramatic improvement in apartment values and fundamentals as well as the contractual annual reduction in the 

benefits of 421a tax abatements in new york city we expect minimal growth if any in full year utility costs due to lower commodity costs we anticipate same store payroll costs to grow 25 to 30 in 2016  over 2015  the company expects overhead costs property management expense and general and administrative expense to decline slightly in 2016 over 2015 while it expects total revenues to decline more significantly as a result of the starwood transaction and other planned 2016 dispositions as certain of the companys overhead costs are fixed andor not quickly scalable the company anticipates overhead costs as a percentage of total revenues will increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 

  

we believe that the company is wellpositioned as of december 31 2015 because our properties are geographically diverse were approximately 943  occupied  957  on a same store basis and the longterm demographic picture is positive we believe certain of our core marketsmetro areas especially washington dc boston and seattle will see substantial near term multifamily supply and there will likely be periods of disruption as new development projects lease up we believe over the longer term that our core markets will absorb future supply without material marketwide disruption because of the strong demand in these markets as exhibited by our current high occupancy levels and increasing household formations we have seen evidence of this in seattle as supply has been absorbed and rental rates continue to grow we believe our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt maturities and development costs in the near term and should also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future 

the current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking

the companys primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less direct property operating expenses including real estate taxes and insurance as well as an allocation of indirect property management costs the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the companys apartment communities the cap rate is generally the first year noi yield net of replacements on the companys investment 

properties that the company owned and were stabilized see definition below for all of both 2015  and 2014  the “ 2015  same store properties” which represented 96286  apartment units impacted the companys results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2014  and 2013  as well as the 18465 stabilized apartment units acquired in the archstone

for the year ended december 31 2015  the company reported diluted earnings per shareunit of 236  compared to 173   

per shareunit for the year ended december 31 2014  the difference is primarily due to approximately 1223 million in higher gains on property sales as well as improved operations in 2015  vs 2014  

for the year ended december 31 2015  income from continuing operations increased approximately 2505 million  when compared to the year ended december 31 2014  the increase in continuing operations is discussed below

net gain on sales of real estate properties increased approximately 1224 million  or 576  as a result of higher gains on the sale of eight consolidated apartment properties during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to ten consolidated property sales during the year ended december 31 2014  all of which did not meet the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

the operating partnership’s “consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio” as of december 31 2015 is presented in the following table the operating partnership calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of i the total outstanding units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the company’s common shares on the new york stock exchange and ii the liquidation value of all perpetual preference units outstanding 





 

the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility and commercial paper program under normal operating conditions the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions 

the company has a flexible dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the company’s core business and provide transparency to investors beginning in 2014 the company began paying its annual dividend based on 65 of the midpoint of the range of normalized ffo guidance customarily provided as part of the companys fourth quarter earnings release the companys 2015 annual dividend payout was 221 per shareunit and the company paid four quarterly dividends of 05525 per shareunit in 2015 the company expects the 2016 annual regular dividend payout will be 2015 per shareunit and the company intends to pay four quarterly dividends of 050375 per shareunit in 2016 due to the continued execution of its disposition strategy the companys anticipated 2016 regular annual dividend will decrease by approximately 88 as compared to 2015 in addition to the regular quarterly dividends the company anticipates paying two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of op units of between 1000 and 1200 per shareunit in the aggregate on february 22 2016 the board of trustees declared a special dividend of 800 per shareunit to be paid on march 10 2016 to shareholdersunitholders of record as of march 3 2016 the company expects to pay an additional special dividend of approximately 200 to 400 per shareunit later in 2016 from the proceeds of additional asset sales all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the board of trustees the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

while our current dividend policy makes it less likely that we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate or large portfolio sales occur however whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature the companys financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels the company believes that its expected 2016  operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and regular dividendsdistributions while net sales proceeds will cover the anticipated special dividends 

the company also expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as lump sum unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities including additional op units proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and cash generated from operations after all distributions in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes line of credit and commercial paper program of the 285 billion in investment in real estate on the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2015  inclusive of 34 billion of real estate held for sale 208 billion inclusive of real estate held for sale or 729 was unencumbered however there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future 

on acceptable terms or otherwise 

erpops longterm senior debt ratings and shortterm commercial paper ratings as well as eqrs longterm preferred equity ratings as of february 19 2016 are as follows 



 

the longterm credit ratings listed above reflect the onelevel upgrades by standard  poors sp and fitch effective april 30 2015 and april 28 2015 respectively as a result of the sp upgrade the interest rate spread on advances under the companys revolving credit facility was lowered from 105 to 095 effective april 30 2015 the longterm credit ratings listed above were reaffirmed following the companys announcement of the starwood transaction and other planned 2016 dispositions eqr does not have shortterm credit ratings 

on january 11 2013 the company replaced its existing 175 billion facility with a 25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing april 1 2018 the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 5000 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be libor plus a spread currently 095 and the company pays an annual facility fee currently 15 basis points both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the company’s longterm debt 

on february 2 2015 the company entered into an unsecured commercial paper note program in the united states the company may borrow up to a maximum of 5000 million under this program subject to market conditions the notes will be sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the companys other unsecured senior indebtedness as of february 19 2016 no amounts were outstanding under this program 

as of february 19 2016  no amounts were outstanding and the amount available on the revolving credit facility was 244 billion  net of 645 million  which was restricteddedicated to support letters of credit this facility may among other potential uses be used to fund property acquisitions costs for certain properties under development and shortterm liquidity requirements 

see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to december 31 2015  

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate 

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories 

 

all replacements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 

 

all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset 

for the year ended december 31 2015  our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1821 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 



 

for the year ended december 31 2014 our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1860 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 



 57 

 

based on the approximately 70000 apartment units expected to be included in same store properties by december 31 2016 the company estimates that it will spend approximately 2200 per apartment unit of capital expenditures inclusive of apartment unit renovationrehab costs or 1600 per apartment unit excluding apartment unit renovationrehab costs during 2016 in 2016  the company expects to spend approximately 400 million for all unit renovationrehab costs primarily on same store properties at a weighted average cost of 10000 per apartment unit rehabbed these anticipated amounts represent an increase in the cost per unit over 2015 but a decline in the absolute dollar amounts which is primarily driven by the companys more valuable urban apartment footprint we will continue to create value from our properties by doing those rehabs that meet our investment parameters the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

  

during the year ended december 31 2015  the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 40 million the company expects to fund approximately 41 million in total nonreal estate capital additions in 2016  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

capital expenditures to real estate and nonreal estate capital additions are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow 

derivative instruments 

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments the company may also use derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates or manage commodity prices in the daily operations of the business 

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place 

see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31 2015  

other 

total distributions paid in january 2016  amounted to 2094 million excluding distributions on partially owned properties which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2015

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of december 31 2015  



 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2015  and are consistent with the year ended december 31 2014  

the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the five critical accounting policies are 

acquisition of investment properties 

the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and 

leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 

  

impairment of longlived assets 

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions and legal and environmental concerns as well as the company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

depreciation of investment in real estate 

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 15year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacement components over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

cost capitalization 

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for a discussion of the company’s policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as increases to depreciable property 

for all development projects the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as constructioninprogress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 

during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  the company capitalized 223 million  224 million  and 165 million  respectively of payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of development activities as well as major capital andor renovation projects 

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates and changes in the securities industry and financial markets association sifma index for taxexempt debt the company also has foreign exchange exposure related to undistributed cash remaining after the sale of its interests in german residential real estate that were acquired as part of the archstone transaction but the company estimates this exposure is now less than 50 million 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program the floating rate taxexempt debt and the fair value hedges that convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt as well as exposure on the refinancing of its debt the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment to the extent the company carries substantial cash balances this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 9 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured debt including its commercial paper were approximately 46 billion  and 65 billion  respectively at december 31 2015  

at december 31 2015  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 15 billion  or 141  of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 8 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 12 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 8 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 12 million 

at december 31 2015  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 94 billion  or 859  of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 51 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 86 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 51 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 105 billion 

at december 31 2015  the company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 30 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 17 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 18 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 17 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 42 million 

  

at december 31 2014  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 15 billion or 140 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 9 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 14 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 9 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 14 million 

at december 31 2014  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 93 billion or 860 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 52 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 85 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 52 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 104 billion 

at december 31 2014  the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 122 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 24 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 72 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 24 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 174 million 

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

competition 

all of the companys properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the companys ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the companys managers in addition other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors for additional information with respect to competition

environmental considerations 

see item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

general 

references to eqr mean equity residential a maryland real estate investment trust reit and references to erpop mean erp operating limited partnership an illinois limited partnership unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “company” “we” “us” or “our” mean collectively eqr erpop and those entitiessubsidiaries owned or controlled by eqr andor erpop and the term “operating partnership” means collectively erpop and those entitiessubsidiaries owned or controlled by erpop this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units op units restricted units formerly known as longterm incentive plan ltip units and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own such securities as our “security holders” 

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 

general 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value these factors include changes in the global national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes all of which could increase over time these operating expenses could rise faster than our revenues causing our income to decline sources of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing increasing portions of single family housing stock being converted to rental use rental housing subsidized by the government other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing governmental regulations slow or negative employment growth and household formation the availability of lowinterest mortgages or the availability of mortgages requiring little or no down payment for single family home buyers changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond the companys control in addition various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents finally the federal governments policies many of which may encourage home ownership can increase competition and possibly limit our ability to raise rents consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 

the retailcommercial space at our properties primarily serves as an additional amenity for our residents the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases generally five to ten years with market based renewal options and the characteristics of many of our tenants generally small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence 

of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition the revenues from our retailcommercial space represent approximately 4 of our total rental income 

we have increased our concentration of properties in certain core markets which could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely affected by economic or other conditions 

we have increased our concentration of properties in certain core markets as a result of our strategy to reposition our portfolio from low barrier to entrynoncore markets to high barrier to entrycore markets if any one or more of our core markets boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco seattle south florida and denver is adversely affected by local or regional economic conditions such as business layoffs industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors or local real estate conditions such as oversupply of or reduced demand for multifamily properties such conditions may have an increased adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

new acquisitions development projects andor rehabs may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

we intend to actively acquire develop and rehab multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues andor lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions or higher than expected operating expenses we may not be able to achieve rents that are consistent with expectations for acquired developed or rehabbed properties we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position to complete a development property or to complete a rehab additionally we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts this competition or lack thereof may increase or depress prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure the total number of apartment units under development costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

in connection with such government regulation we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance 

development and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs and as a result we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities the occupancy rates and rents at a property may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing properties we may be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities 

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority regarding major decisions our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 

we currently do and may continue in the future to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures a portion of the assets acquired in the archstone transaction were acquired through joint ventures with avb that neither we nor avb control solely we have several joint ventures with other real estate investors joint venture investments including the joint ventures with avb involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties including the following 

 at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners frequently we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate and recognize attractive returns on our joint venture investments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and distributions to our shareholders 

several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction along with certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures with avb as part of the archstone transaction are subject to tax protection agreements which could limit our flexibility with respect to our ownership of such assets or cause us to incur material costs 

several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction were contributed to archstone subject to various agreements limiting the ability of the owner of the property to take actions that would trigger income tax liability for the contributing owner of the property including a taxable disposition of the property in addition we will also be required to maintain a certain amount of qualified nonrecourse financing on the tax protected properties during their respective restricted periods our obligations relating to the tax protected properties may affect the way in which we conduct our business including whether when and under what circumstances we sell properties or interests therein and the timing and nature of our financings and refinancing transactions as a result we may not be able to dispose of or refinance the tax protected properties when to do so may have otherwise been favorable to us and our shareholders which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures with avb as part of the archstone transaction have complex tax requirements that if violated may cause us to be required to indemnify the preferred stockholders for certain tax protection costs 

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our 

operating performance or prospects the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including but not limited to the following 

 we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions 

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders however there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels while our current dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate see item 7 for additional discussion regarding our dividend policy 

the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company 

from time to time the company holds investment securities andor cash investments that have various levels of repayment and liquidity risk including government obligations and bond funds money market funds or bank deposits on occasion we also may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank substantially exceeds the fdic insurance limit or we invest cash in money market or similar type funds with investment management institutions that may be subject to now or in the future liquidity restrictions resulting in risk to the company of loss or lack of immediate availability of funds if these banks or institutions fail to meet their obligations 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in our cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of our confidential information andor damage to our reputation and business relationships all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

  

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of our information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information including information regarding our residents and employees as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems both internal and those we have outsourced to third party service providers in addition information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks our primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our reputation damage to our business relationships with our residentstenants and private data exposure we have implemented processes procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks but these measures as well as our increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident 

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders 

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer shareholder employment environmental development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

we are aware that some of our properties have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those properties while we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our properties there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property should mold become an issue in the future our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

climate change 

to the extent that climate change does occur we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

  insurance policy deductibles exclusions and counterparties 

  

as of december 31 2014 the companys property insurance policies provide for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 any earthquake and named windstorm losses in critical areas are subject to a deductible of 5 of the values of the buildings involved in the losses the company also typically selfinsures a substantial portion of the first 50 million of a property loss in excess of these base deductibles should a claim exceed these amounts it would be 100 covered by insurance furthermore the company purchased additional coverage in the event that the company suffers multiple noncatastrophic occurrences with losses from 25 million to 50 million within the same policy year the companys general liability and workers compensation policies at december 31 2014 provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses the company also has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio becoming more concentrated in fewer more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint furthermore the potential impact of climate change increased severe weather or earthquakes could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

the company also has 7500 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses 

as of december 31 2014 the companys cyber liability insurance policy provides for a 50 million general limit and a per occurrence deductible of 250000 cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers this cyber policy would cover the cost of victim notification credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses 

the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability and workers compensation insurance while there has yet to be any nonperformance by these major insurance providers should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact the company in addition the company annually assesses its insurance needs based on the cost of coverage and other factors we may choose to self insure a greater portion of this risk in the future or may choose to have higher deductibles or lesser policy terms 

the inability of lehman to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us under the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction could increase our liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition to certain indemnification obligations of each party to the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction relating to breaches of fundamental representations and warranties and breaches of covenants and certain other specified matters we negotiated as a term in the purchase agreement that lehman retain responsibility for and indemnify us against damages resulting from certain thirdparty claims or other liabilities these thirdparty claims and other liabilities include without limitation costs associated with various litigation matters lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in september 2008 and is currently in the process of postpetition liquidation if lehman completes its liquidation prior to the termination of their indemnity obligations to us under the purchase agreement or otherwise distributes substantially all of its assets to its creditors prior to such time lehman may not be able to satisfy its obligations with respect to claims and retained liabilities covered by the purchase agreement the failure of lehman to satisfy such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition because claimants may successfully assert that we are liable for those claims andor retained liabilities in addition we expect that certain obligations of lehman to indemnify us will terminate upon expiration of the applicable indemnification period generally no more than three years following the closing the assertion of thirdparty 

claims after the expiration of the applicable indemnification period or the failure of lehman to satisfy its indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

nonperformance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties as a result defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided or volatility in the financial markets could affect counterparties ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

debt financing and preferred sharespreference units could adversely affect our performance 

general 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the companys total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31 2014  

in addition to debt we have a liquidation value of 500 million of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interestpreference units with a dividend preference of 829 per annum as of december 31 2014  our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions 

dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly andor to decline 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance 

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac the “government sponsored enterprises” or “gses” through their lender originator networks the gses are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates further reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have a significant impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings the gses regulator has set overall volume limits on most of the lending activities of the gses for 2015 these activities are generally consistent with historical requirements and are not anticipated to materially impact the gses overall multifamily lending activity however going forward the regulator could require the gses to focus more of their lending activities on small borrowers or properties that the regulator deems affordable which may or may not include the companys assets disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit markets perception of the gses which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets 

nonperformance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple 

financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress 

the company also has developed assets with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the revolving credit facility impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders requirements at the lower ratings level 

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the companys debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2014  

financial covenants could adversely affect the companys financial condition 

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facility contains certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  should it fall out of compliance it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds or otherwise contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions including affordability requirements the company and from time to time its consultants monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities 

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 285 as of december 31 2014  in addition our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows 



  

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

advances under our credit facility bears interest at a variable rate based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnerships credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates or be swapped to a floating rate of interest we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders 

derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow 

in the normal course of business we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments including hedging for future debt issuances at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates we may also use derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates or manage commodity prices in the daily operations of our business there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact these arrangements which can include a number of counterparties may expose us to additional risks including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts and may involve extensive costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate foreign exchange or commodity pricing fluctuations 

we depend on our key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer “ceo” if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 

control and influence by significant security holders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other security holders 

the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the sixth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company although to the companys knowledge these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the companys affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees including mr zell and our executive officers see equity residentials definitive proxy statement 

shareholders ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holders rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the companys ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the companys status as a reit we have issued several of these waivers in the past 

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the companys outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements 

however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status however the reit qualification rules permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status there is also risk that congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income 

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger 

  compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company 

in past years we have made and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the internal revenue code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

federal income tax considerations 

general 

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders 

in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flowthrough entity for federal income tax purposes 

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholders personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

our taxation 

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries engaged in activities which cannot be performed directly by a reit such as condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income generated by these activities in our taxable reit subsidiaries 

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis  amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a “taxable reit subsidiary” or “trs” provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 25 of the reits total asset value trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 

 

to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the  de minimis  test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

asset tests  in general on the last day of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets    

 the 10 value test described in clause 3b above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis  change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuers debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis  ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis  exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

  annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholders common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholders tax basis such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reits earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

generally our designated capital gain dividends will be broken out into net capital gains distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20 for individual taxpayers in the highest tax bracket and unrecaptured section 1250 gain distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

certain us shareholders that are taxed as individuals estates or trusts may also be required to pay an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares 

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate 

share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

   

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

taxation of foreign shareholders 

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

 distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt 

from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

 

if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholders common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholders common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholders united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report such distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

 under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholders united states federal income tax liability 

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition if timely requested foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

foreign shareholders sales of common shares   gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

 even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

   

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

  

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such persons united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service 

withholding on foreign financial institutions and nonus shareholders 

the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” is contained in sections 1471 through 1474 of the internal revenue code and the treasury regulations thereunder and was originally enacted in 2010 as part of the hiring incentives to restore employment act fatca will impose a us withholding tax at a 30 rate on dividends paid after june 30 2014 and on proceeds from the sale of our shares paid after december 31 2016 to “foreign financial institutions” as defined under fatca and certain other foreign entities if certain due diligence and disclosure requirements related to us accounts with or ownership of such entities are not satisfied or an exemption does not apply if fatca withholding is imposed nonus beneficial owners that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from or a reduction of us withholding tax with respect to such distributions and sale proceeds would be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction any payment made by us that is subject to withholding under fatca or otherwise will be net of the amount required to be withheld

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

the company invests in high quality apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations and appreciation we are focused primarily on the six core coastal high barrier to entry markets of boston new york washington dc southern california including los angeles orange county and san diego san francisco and seattle these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents 

 

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases review their accounts and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture agreements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales the company may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings 

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entrynoncore markets to high barrier to entrycore markets since 2005 the company has sold over 166000  apartment units primarily in its noncore markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately 161 billion  acquired over 67000  apartment units primarily in its core markets for approximately 195 billion  and began approximately 53 billion  of development projects primarily in its core markets we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets primarily in the following six core coastal metropolitan areas boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle we also have investments in the aggregate about 121  of our noi at december 31 2014  in the two core markets of south florida and denver but do not currently intend to acquire or develop new assets in these markets further we are in the process of exiting phoenix and orlando and will use sales proceeds from these markets to acquire andor develop new assets and for other corporate purposes 

as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially occupied properties and takes options on land or acquires land on which apartment properties can be constructed we intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets as of december 31 2014  no single marketmetropolitan area accounted for more than 175  of our noi though no guarantee can be made that noi concentration may not increase in the future 

we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education resources and opportunities to succeed we provide many classroom and online training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining our properties and improvements equipment and appliances we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions we monitor our employees engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores 

we have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities sustainability and social responsibility are key drivers of our focus on creating the best apartment communities for residents to live work and play we have a dedicated inhouse team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business including investment activities development property operations and property management activities with its high density multifamily housing is by its nature an environmentally friendly property type our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrianfriendly urban locations near public transportation when developing and renovating our properties we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets we continue to implement a combination of irrigation lighting hvac and renewable energy improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption the company was recently named as the 2014 north american residential – large cap sector leader by the global real estate sustainability benchmark gresb survey a globally recognized analysis of the sustainability indicators of approximately 650 real estate portfolios worldwide for additional information regarding our sustainability efforts see our december 2014 corporate social responsibility and sustainability report at our website wwwequityresidentialcom  

current environment 

during the year ended december 31 2014  the company acquired six  consolidated rental properties consisting of 1353  apartment units for 4699 million  and two  land parcels for 288 million  we believe our access to capital our ability to execute large complex transactions and our ability to efficiently stabilize large scale lease up properties provide us with a competitive advantage which was demonstrated in the archstone transaction that closed in 2013 the company currently budgets consolidated rental acquisitions of approximately 5000 million during the year ending december 31 2015  to be funded with proceeds from rental dispositions see discussion below 

  

the company started construction on six  projects representing 2267  apartment units totaling approximately 12 billion  of development costs during the year ended december 31 2014  the company significantly increased its development starts in 2014 as compared to the past few years and while construction activity will remain elevated in 2015 starts should return to more normalized levels the company has budgeted approximately 10 billion of combined new apartment construction starts on land currently owned during the years ending december 31 2015  and 2016 with approximately 4000 million occurring in 2015 and the balance occurring in 2016 we currently budget spending approximately 7000 million on development costs during the year ending december 31 2015  this capital will be primarily sourced with excess operating cash flow expected debt offerings in 2015 and borrowings on our revolving credit facility andor commercial paper program 

the company expects to continue to sell noncore assets and reduce its exposure to noncore markets as we believe these assets will have lower longterm returns and we can sell them for prices that we believe are favorable the company sold ten  consolidated rental properties consisting of 3092  apartment units for 4670 million  one  unconsolidated rental property consisting of 388  apartment units for 625 million  sales price for the unconsolidated rental property is the gross sales price and eqr owned an 85 interest and three  land parcels for 626 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  the company currently budgets consolidated rental dispositions of approximately 5000 million during the year ending december 31 2015  which includes the companys three remaining properties in the orlando market 

we currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets in june 2014 the company completed a 4500 million unsecured five year note offering with a coupon of 2375 and an allin effective interest rate of approximately 252 as well as a 7500 million unsecured thirty year note offering with a coupon of 45 and an allin effective interest rate of approximately 457 the company used the proceeds from these offerings to repay its 7500 million unsecured term loan facility that was scheduled to mature on january 11 2015 and to repay the outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility in february 2015 the company entered into a 5000 million commercial paper program which will allow for daily weekly or monthly borrowing at low floating rates of interest we believe this commercial paper program will allow the company to continue to reduce its already low cost of capital and expect to use the program to replace a portion of the amount that we would otherwise have outstanding under our revolving line of credit the company has budgeted 9500 million of secured or unsecured debt offerings during 2015 excluding usage of the commercial paper program 

we believe that cash and cash equivalents securities readily convertible to cash current availability on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program expected debt offerings and disposition proceeds for 2015 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions debt maturities and existing development projects through 2015 we expect that our remaining longerterm funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings equity issuances property dispositions joint ventures and cash generated from operations 

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac the “government sponsored enterprises” or “gses” through their lender originator networks the gses are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates further reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have a significant impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings the gses regulator has set overall volume limits on most of the lending activities of the gses for 2015 these activities are generally consistent with historical requirements and are not anticipated to materially impact the gses overall multifamily lending activity however going forward the regulator could require the gses to focus more of their lending activities on small borrowers or properties that the regulator deems affordable which may or may not include the companys assets for 2015 the gse’s regulator imposed a limit of 60 billion in multifamily lending volume which excluded certain affordable housing loans loans to small multifamily properties and loans to manufactured housing communities this limit along with the exclusion of certain types of lending activity reflects a modest increase to 2014 levels while no reductions are currently anticipated there can be no assurances that the gses regulator does not mandate reductions or increases in loan pricing in the future such reductions in gse activity or increases in gse loan pricing could provide a competitive advantage to us by making the cost of financing multifamily properties more expensive for other multifamily owners while the company continues to have access to cheaper capital in the public and private debt and equity markets over time we expect that other lenders including banks the commercial mortgagebacked securities market and life insurance companies will become larger sources of debt capital to the multifamily market because multifamily properties are attractive to lenders due to their relatively stable cash flows 

same store revenues increased 43 during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 which was above the high end of our original guidance range of 30 to 40 that we provided in february 2014 strong demand and continued strength in occupancy levels drove the outperformance during 2014 which should continue into 2015 in addition improving labor markets robust household formation and declining single family home ownership levels should keep demand for rental housing high and produce above trend growth for 2015 we anticipate same store revenue increases ranging from 375 to 450 and same store noi increases ranging from 40 to 55 for 2015 as compared to 2014 

all of our markets are generally performing well except for washington dc as noted above demand for our apartments has been strong with high occupancy and low turnover due in part to declines in move outs to buy new homes in general new supply continues to be absorbed in an orderly fashion with leaseups occurring faster than expected and only minimal impact on rents at nearby stabilized assets during 2015 we currently anticipate three groupings of same store revenue growth with san francisco seattle denver and orange county producing 5 or higher new york los angeles san diego south florida and boston producing 3 to 5 although boston might be in the high 2 range and washington dc producing flat to slightly positive growth washington dc which is our largest market has seen record absorption despite anemic job growth in 2014 however washington dc continues to show signs of stress as substantial new supply and the impact of government budget constraints and cutbacks have dampened the metro area economy despite slow growth in the overall economy and the issues noted in washington dc our business continues to perform well because of the combined forces of demographics household formations and increasing consumer preference for the flexibility of rental housing all of which should ensure a continued strong demand for rental housing 

same store expenses increased 18 during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 which was below the low end of our original guidance range of 20 to 30 that we provided in february 2014 by leveraging the integration of the archstone portfolio through lower onsite payroll and a more efficient property management company we were able to offset 56 and 50 increases in same store real estate taxes and utilities respectively same store expense growth in the controllable property level expenses excluding real estate taxes and utilities declined 15 during 2014 as compared to 2013 the company anticipates that 2015 same store expenses will increase 25 to 35 with increases in real estate taxes expected to approximate  50 for the full year 2015 the increase in real estate taxes is primarily due to rate and value increases in certain states and municipalities reflecting those states and municipalities continued economic challenges and the dramatic improvement in apartment values and fundamentals as well as the continued burn off of 421a tax abatements in new york city we expect full year utility costs to decline approximately 10 due to significant declines in natural gas and heating oil partially offset by higher costs for electricity water sewer and trash with an improving labor market and the archstone portfolio staffing fully optimized we anticipate same store payroll costs to grow 20 to 30 in 2015 over 2014 

  

we believe that the company is wellpositioned as of december 31 2014 because our properties are geographically diverse were approximately 951  occupied  957  on a same store basis and the longterm demographic picture is positive we believe certain market areas especially washington dc downtown boston and cambridge and seattle will see substantial near term multifamily supply yet total new supply levels for our core markets remain within historical ranges we believe over the longer term that our core markets will absorb future supply without material marketwide disruption because of the high occupancy levels we currently experience and increasing household formations we have seen evidence of this in seattle as supply has been absorbed and rental rates continue to grow we believe our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt maturities and development costs in the near term and should also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future 

the current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

  

results of operations 

in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy the company continued to invest primarily in apartment properties located in our high barrier to entrycore markets and primarily sell properties in our low barrier to entrynoncore markets during the years ended december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  in summary we

 the companys primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the companys apartment communities the cap rate is generally the first year noi yield net of replacements on the companys investment 

properties that the company owned and were stabilized see definition below for all of both 2014  and 2013  as well as the 18465 stabilized apartment units acquired in the archstone acquisition that are owned and managed by the company the “ 2014  same store properties” which represented 97911  apartment units impacted the companys results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2013  and 2012  the “ 2013  same store properties” which represented 80247  apartment units also impacted the companys results of operations both the 2014  same store properties and 2013  same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

the following tables provide a rollforward of the apartment units included in same store properties and a reconciliation of apartment units included in same store properties to those included in total properties for the year ended december 31 2014  





note properties are considered stabilized when they have achieved 90 occupancy for three consecutive months properties are included in same store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented same store includes the 18465 stabilized apartment units acquired in the archstone acquisition that are owned and managed by the company with pro forma preownership results for the period january 1 2013 to february 27 2013

comparison of the year ended december 31 2014  to the year ended december 31 2013   

  

for the year ended december 31 2014  the company reported diluted earnings per shareunit of 173  compared to 516  per shareunit for the year ended december 31 2013  the difference is primarily due to approximately 18 billion in higher gains on property sales in 2013 vs 2014 partially offset by 696 million of higher mergerrelated expenses incurred in 2013 vs 2014 in connection with the archstone acquisition 1228 million of higher debt extinguishment costs incurred in 2013 vs 2014 in connection with early debt extinguishment of existing mortgage notes payable to manage the companys post archstone 2017 maturities profile and higher depreciation in 2013 as a direct result of inplace residential lease intangibles acquired in the archstone transaction 

for the year ended december 31 2014  income from continuing operations increased approximately 8253 million  when compared to the year ended december 31 2013  the increase in continuing operations is discussed below 

revenues from the 2014  same store properties increased 1016 million  primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents higher occupancy and a decrease in turnover expenses from the 2014  same store properties increased 148 million  primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and utilities partially offset by lower property management costs the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2014  same store properties

for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1 2014 and expects to continue to own through december 31 2015  the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2015  



the company anticipates consolidated rental acquisitions of 5000 million and consolidated rental dispositions of 5000 million and expects that acquisitions will have a 100 lower cap rate than dispositions for the full year ending december 31 2015  

  

these 2015  assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

nonsame store operating results increased approximately 345 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2013  and 2014  as well as operations from the company’s completed development properties but exclude the 18465 stabilized apartment units acquired in the archstone acquisition that are owned and managed by the company this increase primarily resulted from 

 

see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s segment disclosures 

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased approximately 08 million  or 238  primarily as a result of higher revenue earned on management of the companys military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base and lower expenses partially offset by lower fees earned on management of the company’s unconsolidated development joint ventures 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses decreased approximately 47 million or 56  this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in payrollrelated costs office rent educationconferences and legal and professional fees 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets decreased approximately 2201 million or 225 primarily as a result of inplace residential lease intangibles which are generally amortized over a six month period and can significantly elevate depreciation expense following an acquisition especially during 2013 as a direct result of the archstone acquisition partially offset by additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2014 development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses decreased approximately 112 million or 181 primarily due to a decrease in payrollrelated costs and office rent the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 510 million to 530 million for the year ending december 31 2015  excluding approximately 97 million in duplicative costs related to the companys revised executive compensation program the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately 08 million  or 155  primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of certain investment securities during the year ended december 31 2013 that did not reoccur in 2014 partially offset by proceeds received from various insurancelitigation settlements totaling 28 million during the year ended december 31 2014 that did not occur in 2013 the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate 05 million for the year ending december 31 2015 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

other expenses from continuing operations decreased approximately 206 million or 694 primarily due to the closing of the archstone acquisition during the year ended december 31 2013 and the significant decline in transaction activity during the year ended december 31 2014 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 1408 million or 231 primarily as a result of 1228 million of higher debt extinguishment costs incurred on early debt prepayments and writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing costs in 2013 vs 2014 related to managing the companys post archstone 2017 maturities profile and higher capitalized interest in 2014 during the year ended december 31 2014  the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 528 million as compared to 473 million for the year ended december 31 2013  this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2014 was 474 as compared to 491 excluding 1076 million in net debt extinguishment costs for the year ended december 31 2013  the company anticipates that interest expense from continuing operations will approximate 4428 million to 4551 million excluding debt extinguishment costs for the year ending december 31 2015  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately 02 million or 192  primarily due to increases in estimated taxes related to properties sold by the companys trs in 2014 vs 2013 partially offset by a reduction and timing of all other taxes the company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate 10 million to 15 million for the year ending december 31 2015  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased by 502 million  or 863 primarily due to indirect costs incurred in 2013 from the archstone acquisition through the companys joint ventures with avb such as severance and retention bonuses that have significantly decreased in 2014 

net gain on sales of real estate properties increased 2127 million as a result of the sale of ten consolidated apartment properties during the year ended december 31 2014 that did not meet the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations see notes 2 and 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately 70 million or 568  due to the gain on sale of three land parcels during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to seven land sales during the year ended december 31 2013 

discontinued operations net decreased approximately 21 billion  or 999 between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily due to substantially higher sales volume during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2014 and due to the companys adoption of the new discontinued operations standard effective january 1 2014 see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2013  to the year ended december 31 2012   

for the year ended december 31 2013  the company reported diluted earnings per share of 516  compared to 270  per share for the year ended december 31 2012  the difference is primarily due to higher gains from property sales in 2013 vs 2012 and higher total property net operating income driven by the positive impact of the companys same store and stabilized archstone properties partially offset by 739 million of mergerrelated expenses incurred in connection with the archstone acquisition 1217 million of costs incurred in connection with early debt extinguishment of existing mortgage notes payable to manage the companys post archstone 2017 maturities profile higher depreciation as a direct result of the archstone transaction the issuance of common shares to the public in december 2012 and to an affiliate of lehman brothers holdings inc in february 2013 as partial consideration for the archstone acquisition and the companys recognition of 1500 million in archstonerelated termination fees in 2012 

for the year ended december 31 2013  loss from continuing operations increased approximately 3285 million  when compared to the year ended december 31 2012  the decrease in continuing operations is discussed below 

revenues from the 2013 same store properties increased 760 million primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents slightly higher occupancy and a decrease in turnover expenses from the 2013 same store properties increased 202 million primarily due to increases in real estate taxes utilities and repairs and maintenance costs partially offset by lower property management costs the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2013 same store properties 



 the following table provides comparative same store operating expenses for the 2013  same store properties 



 

nonsame store operating results increased approximately 3773 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2012 and 2013 as well as operations from the company’s completed development properties although the operations of both the nonsame store assets and the same store assets have been positively impacted during the year ended december 31 2013 the nonsame store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total noi to the company’s overall operating results primarily due to 2012 and 2013 acquisitions increasing occupancy for properties in leaseup and a longer ownership period in 2013 than 2012 this increase primarily resulted from

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses decreased approximately 17 million or 341 primarily as a result of higher expenses and lower revenue earned on management of the companys military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base partially offset by fees earned on management of the company’s unconsolidated development joint ventures 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased approximately 24 million or 30 this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payrollrelated costs and an increase in computer operations due to the modernization of employee technology partially offset by the timing of legal and professional fees 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 4183 million or 746 primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2013 including the archstone properties development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of furniture fixtures and equipment that were fully depreciated inplace residential lease intangibles are generally amortized over a six month period and can significantly elevate depreciation expense following an acquisition especially during 2013 as a direct result of the archstone acquisition 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 149 million or 316 primarily due to an increase in payrollrelated costs which is largely a result of higher and accelerated longterm compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and higher compensation related to the archstone transaction as well as an increase in office rent 

interest and other income from continuing operations decreased 1458 million or 965 primarily due to the company recognizing 1500 million in archstonerelated termination fees during the year ended december 31 2012 partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of investment securities and technology investments during the year ended december 31 2013 

other expenses from continuing operations which includes direct costs incurred from the archstone acquisition such as investment banking and legalaccounting costs increased approximately 18 million or 66 as a result of the closing of the archstone acquisition during the year ended december 31 2013 partially offset by lower property pursuit costs as the company focused on its pursuit of archstone 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 1325 million or 278 primarily as a result of the following 

 the above increases to interest expense were partially offset by the following 

 

during the year ended december 31 2013 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 473 million as compared to 225 million for the year ended december 31 2012 this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated 

projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2013 was 491 excluding 1076 million in net debt extinguishment costs as compared to 537 for the year ended december 31 2012 

income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately 07 million primarily due to increases in taxes related to land parcel sales owned by the companys trs as well as increases in all other taxes 

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities which includes indirect costs incurred from the archstone acquisition through the companys joint ventures with avb increased by 581 million primarily as a result of severance obligations and retention bonuses in connection with the archstone acquisition through our 60 interest in unconsolidated joint ventures as well as the gain on sale of one unconsolidated land parcel during the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to no sales during the year ended december 31 2012 

net gain on sales of land parcels increased approximately 122 million due to the gain on sale of seven land parcels during the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to no land sales during the year ended december 31 2012 

discontinued operations net increased approximately 14 billion between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily due to higher gains on sales from dispositions during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 partially offset by properties sold in 2013 that reflect operations for a partial period in 2013 in contrast to a full period in 2012 see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility and commercial paper program under normal operating conditions the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions 

the company has a flexible dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the company’s core business and provide transparency to investors beginning in 2014 the company began paying its annual dividend based on 65 of the midpoint of the range of normalized ffo guidance customarily provided as part of the companys fourth quarter earnings release the companys 2014 annual dividend payout was 200 per share and the company paid four quarterly dividends of 050 per share in 2014 the company expects the 2015 annual dividend payout will be 221 per share and the company intends to pay four quarterly dividends of 05525 per share in 2015 all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the board of trustees the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking while our current dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate however whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature the companys financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels the company believes that its expected 2015 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions 

the company also expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as lump sum unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities including additional op units proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and cash generated from operations after all distributions in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit of the 277 billion in investment in real estate on the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2014  191 billion or 691 was unencumbered however there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise

see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to december 31 2014  

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate 

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories 

 55 

 all replacements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 

 

all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset 

for the year ended december 31 2014  our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1860 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 

capital expenditures to real estate 

for the year ended december 31 2014   



 for the year ended december 31 2013  our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1358 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 

capital expenditures to real estate 

for the year ended december 31 2013   



 

in 2014 the company spent 1829 per apartment unit of capital expenditures inclusive of apartment unit renovationrehab costs or 1304 per apartment unit excluding apartment unit renovationrehab costs on its same store properties these amounts represented an increase in the cost per unit over 2013 which was primarily driven by increases in building improvement costs ie roofs mechanical systems and siding for the archstone assets as well as certain large building improvement projects the company had planned to complete in 2013 but were delayed and instead completed in 2014 the company also accelerated its renovationrehab efforts in 2014 

in 2015 the company estimates that it will spend approximately 1850 per apartment unit of capital expenditures inclusive of apartment unit renovationrehab costs or 1250 per apartment unit excluding apartment unit renovationrehab costs on its same store properties in 2015 the company expects to spend approximately 600 million for all unit renovationrehab costs primarily on same store properties at a weighted average cost of 9000 per apartment unit rehabbed these anticipated amounts represent an increase in the cost per unit over 2014 which is primarily driven by increases in planned renovationrehab efforts in 2015 with plans to continue to create value from our properties by doing those rehabs that meet our investment parameters the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

  

during the year ended december 31 2014 the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 53 million the company expects to fund approximately 48 million in total nonreal estate capital additions in 2015 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

capital expenditures to real estate and nonreal estate capital additions are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow 

derivative instruments 

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments the company may also use derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates or manage commodity prices in the daily operations of the business 

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place 

see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31 2014  

other 

total distributions paid in january 2015  amounted to 1886 million excluding distributions on partially owned properties which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2014  

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

archstone acquisition 

on february 27 2013 in conjunction with the archstone acquisition the company acquired unconsolidated interests in certain joint ventures the company does not believe that these investments have a materially different impact upon its liquidity cash flows capital resources credit or market risk than its other consolidated operating andor development activities details of these interests follow by project

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of december 31 2014  



 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2014  and are consistent with the year ended december 31 2013  

the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the five critical accounting policies are 

acquisition of investment properties 

the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 

impairment of longlived assets 

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions and legal and environmental concerns as well as the company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

depreciation of investment in real estate 

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 15year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacement components over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

cost capitalization 

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for a discussion of the company’s policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as increases to depreciable property 

for all development projects the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as constructioninprogress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 

during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  the company capitalized 224 million  165 million  and 143 million  respectively of payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of development activities as well as major capital andor renovation projects 

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 

funds from operations and normalized funds from operations 

for the year ended december 31 2014  funds from operations “ffo” available to common shares and units  units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units  units increased 3185 million  or 365  and increased 1394 million  or 132  respectively as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  for the year ended december 31 2013 ffo available to common shares and units  units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units  units decreased 1208 million  or 122  and increased 1738 million  or 197  respectively as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 

the following is the companys and the operating partnerships reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and units  units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units  units for each of the five years ended december 31 2014

calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis the april 2002 white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only once the company commences the conversion of apartment units to condominiums it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates and changes in the securities industry and financial markets association sifma index for taxexempt debt the company also has foreign exchange exposure related to undistributed cash remaining after the sale of its interests in german residential real estate that were acquired as part of the archstone transaction 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving credit facility as well as floating rate taxexempt debt the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment to the extent the company carries substantial cash balances this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 9 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured debt including its line of credit were approximately 51 billion  and 61 billion  

respectively at december 31 2014  

at december 31 2014  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 15 billion  or 140  of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 9 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 14 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 9 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 14 million 

at december 31 2014  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 93 billion  or 860  of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 52 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 85 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 52 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 104 billion 

at december 31 2014  the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 122 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 24 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 72 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 24 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 174 million 

  

at december 31 2013  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 16 billion or 153 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 12 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 20   million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 12 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 20   million 

at december 31 2013  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 91 billion or 847 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 51 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the companys fixed rate debt would be approximately 83 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 51 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the companys fixed rate debt would be approximately 101 billion 

at december 31 2013  the companys derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 187 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 33 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the companys derivative instruments would be approximately 280 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 33 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the companys derivative instruments would be approximately 94 million 

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner 

our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units op units longterm incentive plan units “ltip units” and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units ltip units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own sharesunits opltip units and public unsecured debt as our “security holders” 

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 

general 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value these factors include changes in the global national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes all of which could increase over time sources of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing rental housing subsidized by the government other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing governmental regulations slow or negative employment growth and household formation the availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond the companys control in addition various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents finally the federal governments policies many of which may encourage home ownership can increase competition and possibly limit our ability to raise rents consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 

the retailcommercial space at our properties primarily serves as an additional amenity for our residents the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases generally five to ten years with market based renewal options and the characteristics of many of our tenants generally small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition the revenues from our retailcommercial space represent approximately 4 of our total rental income 

we increased our concentration of properties in certain core markets as a result of the archstone transaction which could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely affected by economic or other conditions 

as a result of the archstone transaction we increased our concentration of properties in certain core markets as a result of our strategy to reposition our portfolio from low barrier to entrynoncore markets to high barrier to entrycore markets if any one or more of such core markets such as washington dc southern california new york or san francisco is adversely affected by local or regional economic conditions such as business layoffs industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors or local real estate conditions such as oversupply of or reduced demand for multifamily properties such conditions may have an increased adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

new acquisitions development projects andor rehabs may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

we intend to actively acquire develop and rehab multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues andor lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions we may not be able to achieve rents that are consistent with expectations for acquired developed or rehabbed properties we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position to complete a development property or to complete a rehab additionally we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts this competition or lack thereof may increase or depress prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure the total number of apartment units under development costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

in connection with such government regulation we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance 

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority regarding major decisions our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 

we currently do and may continue in the future to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures a portion of the assets acquired in the archstone transaction were acquired through joint ventures with avb that neither we nor avb control solely joint venture investments including the joint ventures with avb involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties including the following 

 13 

 at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners frequently we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate and recognize attractive returns on our joint venture investments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and distributions to our shareholders 

several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction along with certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures with avb as part of the archstone transaction are subject to tax protection agreements which could limit our flexibility with respect to our ownership of such assets or cause us to incur material costs 

several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction were contributed to archstone subject to various agreements limiting the ability of the owner of the property to take actions that would trigger income tax liability for the contributing owner of the property including a taxable disposition of the property in addition we will also be required to maintain a certain amount of qualified nonrecourse financing on the tax protected properties during their respective restricted periods our obligations relating to the tax protected properties may affect the way in which we conduct our business including whether when and under what circumstances we sell properties or interests therein and the timing and nature of our financings and refinancing transactions as a result we may not be able to dispose of or refinance the tax protected properties when to do so may have otherwise been favorable to us and our shareholders which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures with avb as part of the archstone transaction have complex tax requirements that if violated may cause us to be required to indemnify the preferred stockholders for certain tax protection costs 

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including but not limited to the following 

 

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions 

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders however there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels while our current dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate see item 7 for additional discussion regarding our dividend policy 

the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company 

from time to time the company holds investment securities andor cash investments that have various levels of repayment and liquidity risk including government obligations and bond funds money market funds or bank deposits on occasion we also may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank substantially exceeds the fdic insurance limit or we invest cash in money market or similar type funds with investment management institutions resulting in risk to the company of loss of funds if these banks or institutions fail 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price 

the occurrence of cyber incidents or a deficiency in our cybersecurity could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations a compromise or corruption of our confidential information andor damage to our reputation and business relationships all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of our information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems both internal and those we have outsourced our primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our reputation damage to our business relationships with our residentstenants and private data exposure we have implemented processes procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks but these measures as well as our increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident 

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders 

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer shareholder employment environmental development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation 

and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate as some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted by excluding moldrelated claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property should mold become an issue in the future our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

climate change 

to the extent that climate change does occur we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

  insurance policy deductibles exclusions and counterparties 

  

as of december 31 2013 the companys property insurance policies provide for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and a selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate selfinsured retention of 75 million for “all risk” losses any earthquake and named windstorm losses in critical areas are subject to a deductible of 5 of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate selfinsured retention the company also typically selfinsures a substantial portion of the first 50 million of a property loss in excess of these base deductibles and selfinsured retentions should a claim exceed these amounts it would be 100 covered by insurance the companys general liability and workers compensation policies at december 31 2013 provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses the company also has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio becoming more concentrated in fewer more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint furthermore the potential impact of climate change increased severe weather or earthquakes could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

the company also has 7500 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses 

as of december 31 2013 the companys cyber liability insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and a 50 million general limit cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release 

through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers this cyber policy would cover the cost of victim notification credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses 

the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability and workers compensation insurance while there has yet to be any nonperformance by these major insurance providers should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact the company in addition the company annually assesses its insurance needs based on the cost of coverage and other factors we may choose to self insure a greater portion of this risk in the future or may choose to have higher deductibles or lesser policy terms 

the inability of lehman to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us under the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction could increase our liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition to certain indemnification obligations of each party to the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction relating to breaches of fundamental representations and warranties and breaches of covenants and certain other specified matters we negotiated as a term in the purchase agreement that lehman retain responsibility for and indemnify us against damages resulting from certain thirdparty claims or other liabilities these thirdparty claims and other liabilities include without limitation costs associated with various litigation matters lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in september 2008 and is currently in the process of postpetition liquidation if lehman completes its liquidation prior to the termination of their indemnity obligations to us under the purchase agreement or otherwise distributes substantially all of its assets to its creditors prior to such time lehman may not be able to satisfy its obligations with respect to claims and retained liabilities covered by the purchase agreement the failure of lehman to satisfy such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition because claimants may successfully assert that we are liable for those claims andor retained liabilities in addition we expect that certain obligations of lehman to indemnify us will terminate upon expiration of the applicable indemnification period generally no more than three years following the closing the assertion of thirdparty claims after the expiration of the applicable indemnification period or the failure of lehman to satisfy its indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

nonperformance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties as a result defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided or volatility in the financial markets could affect counterparties ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

debt financing and preferred sharespreference units could adversely affect our performance 

general 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the companys total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31 2013  

in addition to debt we have a liquidation value of 500 million of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interestpreference units with a dividend preference of 829 per annum as of december 31 2013  our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions 

dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our 

securities to fluctuate significantly andor to decline 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance 

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac the “government sponsored enterprises” or “gses” and recent changes in leadership of the gses regulator has heightened this uncertainty through their lender originator networks the gses are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities should the gses have their mandates changed or reduced materially change their lending terms lose key personnel be disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue providing liquidity to our sector it would significantly reduce our access to secured debt capital andor increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets andor the values realized upon sale during the first quarter of 2013 the regulator of the gses required the gses to decrease their 2013 multifamily lending activities by 10 compared to 2012 levels and it is not clear if further reductions will be mandated the gses regulator may require the gses to focus more of their lending activities on properties that the regulator deems affordable which may or may not include the companys assets disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit markets perception of the gses which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets 

nonperformance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress 

the company also has developed assets with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility or requiring repayment of our delayed draw term loan facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the revolving credit facility and also under our delayed draw term loan facility and impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders requirements at the lower ratings level 

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the 

companys debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2013  

financial covenants could adversely affect the companys financial condition 

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facilities and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  should it fall out of compliance it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds or otherwise contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions including affordability requirements the company and from time to time its consultants monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities 

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 356 as of december 31 2013  in addition our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows 



rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnerships credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders 

derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow 

in the normal course of business we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments including hedging for future debt issuances at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates we may also use derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates or manage commodity prices in the daily operations of our business there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact these arrangements which can include a number of counterparties may expose us to additional risks including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts and may involve extensive costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

if we terminate them no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate foreign exchange or commodity pricing fluctuations 

we depend on our key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer “ceo” if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 

control and influence by significant security holders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other security holders 

the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the sixth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company although to the companys knowledge these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the companys affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees including mr zell and our executive officers see equity residentials definitive proxy statement 

shareholders ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holders rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the companys ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the companys status as a reit we have issued several of these waivers in the past 

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the companys outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status however the reit qualification rules permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status there is also risk that congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income 

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger 

  

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company 

in past years we have made and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the internal revenue code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

federal income tax considerations 

general 

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flowthrough entity for federal income tax purposes 

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholders personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

our taxation 

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries engaged in activities which cannot be performed directly by a reit such as condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income generated by these activities in our taxable reit subsidiaries 

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such 

transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis  amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a “taxable reit subsidiary” or “trs” provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 25 of the reits total asset value trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 

 23 

from real property interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property gain from the sale or other disposition of nondealer real property and shares of reit stock dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments excluding certain hedging income 

 

to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the  de minimis  test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

asset tests  in general on the last day of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets    

 the 10 value test described in clause 3b above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis  change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuers debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis  ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying 

assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis  exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

  annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholders common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholders tax basis such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reits earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

generally our designated capital gain dividends will be broken out into net capital gains distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20 as of january 1 2013 for individual taxpayers in the highest tax bracket and unrecaptured section 1250 gain distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

certain us shareholders that are taxed as individuals estates or trusts may also be required to pay an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares 

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

   

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit 

for purposes of this rule 

taxation of foreign shareholders 

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

 distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

 

if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholders common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholders common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholders united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report such distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

 27 

that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax as discussed above or 

 under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholders united states federal income tax liability 

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition if timely requested foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

foreign shareholders sales of common shares   gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

 even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

   

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

  

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to 

backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such persons united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service 

withholding on foreign financial institutions and nonus shareholders 

the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” is contained in sections 1471 through 1474 of the internal revenue code and the treasury regulations thereunder and was originally enacted in 2010 as part of the hiring incentives to restore employment act fatca will impose a us withholding tax at a 30 rate on dividends paid after june 30 2014 and on proceeds from the sale of our shares paid after december 31 2016 to “foreign financial institutions” as defined under fatca and certain other foreign entities if certain due diligence and disclosure requirements related to us accounts with or ownership of such entities are not satisfied or an exemption does not apply if fatca withholding is imposed nonus beneficial owners that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from or a reduction of us withholding tax with respect to such distributions and sale proceeds would be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction any payment made by us that is subject to withholding under fatca or otherwise will be net of the amount required to be withheld

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

the company invests in high quality apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation we are focused primarily on the six core coastal high barrier to entry markets of boston new york washington dc southern california including los angeles orange county and san diego san francisco and seattle these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents 

 

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases review their accounts and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture agreements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales the company may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings the company has also in the past converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business 

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entrynoncore markets to high barrier to entrycore markets since 2005 the company has sold over 162000 apartment units primarily in its noncore markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately 156 billion acquired over 66000 apartment units primarily in its core markets for approximately 190 billion and began approximately 41 billion of development projects primarily in its core markets we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets primarily in the following six core coastal metropolitan areas boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle we also have investments in the aggregate about 119 of our noi at december 31 2013 in the two core markets of south florida and denver but do not currently intend to acquire or develop new assets in these markets further we are in the process of exiting phoenix and orlando and will use sales proceeds from these markets to acquire andor develop new assets and for other corporate purposes 

as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially occupied properties and takes options on land or acquires land on which apartment properties can be constructed we intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets as of december 31 2013 no single marketmetropolitan area accounted for more than 186 of our noi though no guarantee can be made that noi concentration may not increase in the future 

we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education resources and opportunities to succeed we provide many classroom and online training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining our properties and improvements equipment and appliances we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or

current environment 

on february 27 2013 the company avalonbay communities inc “avb” and certain of their respective subsidiaries completed their previouslyannounced acquisition the “archstone acquisition” or the “archstone transaction” from archstone enterprise lp “enterprise” which subsequently changed its name to jupiter enterprise lp an affiliate of lehman brothers holdings inc “lehman” and its affiliates of all of the assets and liabilities of enterprise including interests in various entities affiliated with enterprise constituting a portfolio of apartment properties and other assets the “archstone portfolio” as a result of the archstone acquisition the company owns assets representing approximately 60 of the archstone portfolio the consideration paid by the company in connection with the archstone acquisition consisted of cash in the amount of approximately 40 billion inclusive of 20 billion of archstone secured mortgage principal paid off in conjunction with the closing 34468085 common shares which shares had a total value of 19 billion based on the acquisition date closing price of eqrs common shares of 5599 per share and the assumption of 31 billion of mortgage debt inclusive of a net marktomarket premium of 1279 million and approximately 60 of all of the other assets and liabilities related to the archstone portfolio on february 18 2014 lehman publicly announced that it had sold the remaining common shares issued by the company as partial consideration for the portion of the archstone portfolio acquired by the company 

during the year ended december 31 2013 the company acquired 73 consolidated properties consisting of 20914 apartment units one unconsolidated property consisting of 336 apartment units three consolidated masterleased properties consisting of 853 apartment units four projects in various stages of development two consolidated and two unconsolidated and 15 land parcels for 91 billion all but one of these properties and all but one of these land parcels were acquired in conjunction with the archstone transaction and the company has completed the integration of these properties and their operations we believe our access to capital our ability to execute large complex transactions and our ability to efficiently stabilize large scale lease up properties provide us with a competitive advantage which was demonstrated in the archstone transaction the company currently budgets consolidated acquisitions of approximately 5000 million during the year ending december 31 2014 to be funded with proceeds from dispositions see discussion below 

the company started construction on seven projects representing 2213 apartment units totaling approximately 8809 million of development costs during the year ended december 31 2013 the company expects to increase its development activity as compared to the past few years and has budgeted approximately 7500 million of new apartment construction starts on land currently owned during each of the years ending december 31 2014 and 2015 we currently budget spending approximately 5750 million on development costs during the year ending december 31 2014 this capital will be primarily sourced with excess operating cash flow and availability on our revolving credit facility 

the company continues to sell noncore assets and reduce its exposure to noncore markets as we believe these assets will have lower longterm returns and we can sell them for prices that we believe are favorable the archstone transaction provided an opportunity to accelerate this strategy and do so efficiently through the use of section 1031 tax deferred exchanges the company sold 94 consolidated properties consisting of 29180 apartment units seven consolidated land parcels and one commercial building for 46 billion and one unconsolidated land parcel for 264 million sales price for the unconsolidated land parcel is the gross sales price and eqrs share of the net sales proceeds approximated 25 during the year ended december 31 2013 these dispositions combined with reinvestment of the cash proceeds in assets with lower cap rates see definition below were dilutive to our earnings per share the company defines dilution from transactions as the lost noi from sales proceeds that were not reinvested in other apartment properties or were reinvested in properties with a lower cap rate the company funded a significant portion of the cash purchase price of the archstone transaction with capital raised through these significant dispositions of assets while this accelerated disposition program was dilutive to our per share results it also significantly mitigated the execution risk 

on the archstone transaction beginning in 2014 and going forward the company expects a decrease in dilution due to our reduced disposition expectations and the locations of our planned dispositions the company currently budgets consolidated dispositions of approximately 5000 million during the year ending december 31 2014 

as a result of the archstone transaction and the property sales to help finance the transaction the company’s portfolio has changed significantly from the portfolio summary included in the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2012 the following table sets forth certain information by market relating to the companys properties at december 31 2013 as compared to december 31 2012 



note projects under development are not included in the portfolio summary until construction has been completed 

 

we currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets in april 2013 the company completed a 5000 million unsecured ten year note offering with a coupon of 300 and an allin effective interest rate of approximately 40 including the effect of fees and the termination of certain interest rate hedges in february 2013 the company issued 34468085 common shares with a value of 19 billion based on the february 27 2013 closing price of eqr common shares of 5599 per share to an affiliate of lehman brothers holdings inc as partial consideration for the acquisition of the archstone portfolio in december 2012 the company raised 12 billion in equity in a public offering of 21850000 common shares priced at 5475 per share on january 11 2013 the company replaced its existing 175 billion credit facility with a 25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing april 1 2018 the company believes that the new facility provided by a diversified and strong bank group increases its balance sheet flexibility going forward on january 11 2013 the company also entered into a senior unsecured 7500 million delayed draw term loan facility which was 

fully drawn on february 27 2013 in connection with the archstone acquisition 

in october 2013 the company used cash on hand from dispositions to repay 9635 million outstanding of 5883 mortgage debt assumed as part of the archstone transaction prior to the november 1 2014 maturity date also in october 2013 the company closed a new 8000 million mortgage loan from a large insurance company which matures on november 10 2023 is interest only and carries a fixed interest rate of 421 the company used the loan proceeds from this new loan to simultaneously repay 8250 million of a 127 billion mortgage loan assumed as part of the archstone transaction the approximately 4400 million balance will remain outstanding continue to mature in november 2017 and continue to carry a fixed interest rate of 6256 in conjunction with the early debt extinguishment activity discussed above the company incurred cash prepayment costs of approximately 1510 million and a net charge to earnings of approximately 429 million after consideration of the writeoff of the archstonerelated debt premium the company believes it has obtained favorable interest terms on this long term debt and has substantially extended the duration of its debt maturities as well as reduced its 2014 and 2017 maturities as a percentage of outstanding debt 

 we believe that cash and cash equivalents securities readily convertible to cash current availability on our revolving credit facility and disposition proceeds for 2014 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions debt maturities and existing development projects through 2014 we expect that our remaining longerterm funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings equity issuances property dispositions joint ventures and cash generated from operations 

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac the “government sponsored enterprises” or “gses” and recent changes in leadership of the gses regulator has heightened this uncertainty through their lender originator networks the gses are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates further reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have a significant impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings during the first quarter of 2013 the regulator of the gses required the gses to decrease their 2013 multifamily lending activities by 10 compared to 2012 levels and it is not clear if further reductions will be mandated the gses regulator may require the gses to focus more of their lending activities on properties that the regulator deems affordable which may or may not include the companys assets by selling the assets required to pay for archstone in the first half of 2013 the company substantially mitigated the risk that changes in gse activity would impact its archstonerelated disposition program reductions in gse activity or increases in gse loan pricing may also provide a competitive advantage to us by making the cost of financing multifamily properties more expensive for other multifamily owners while the company continues to have access to cheaper capital in the public and private debt and equity markets see examples of this access discussed above over time we expect that other lenders including the commercial mortgagebacked securities market and life insurance companies will become larger sources of debt capital to the multifamily market because multifamily properties are attractive to lenders due to their relatively stable cash flows 

we expect continued growth in revenue anticipated 2014 same store revenue increase ranging from 30 to 40 and noi anticipated 2014 same store noi increase ranging from 350 to 475 and are optimistic that the continued strength in fundamentals across most of our markets will produce solid performance through 2014 and beyond these samestore assumptions include the nearly 18500 stabilized apartment units that we acquired in the archstone transaction we believe the key drivers behind the anticipated increase in revenue are base rent pricing for new residents renewal pricing for existing residents resident turnover and physical occupancy for 2014 we expect average base rent growth of 325 an increase in renewal rates of 475 occupancy of 954 and turnover at 515 our largest market washington dc continues to show signs of stress as new supply and the impact of sequestration and furloughs have dampened the metro area economy however as evidenced by our continued high occupancy levels there continues to be healthy demand for apartments in washington dc even in the face of declining government payrolls and procurement as the supply peaks in 2014 we expect our washington dc results to produce a 1 decline in same store revenues during 2014 which will likely reduce our expected companywide same store revenue growth by 1 despite slow growth in the overall economy and the issues noted in washington dc our business continues to perform well because of the combined forces of demographics household formations and increasing consumer preference for the flexibility of rental housing all of which should ensure a continued strong demand for rental housing 

the company anticipates that 2014 same store expenses will increase 20 to 30 primarily due to increases in real estate taxes which are expected to increase 525 and utilities which are expected to increase in excess of 75 the increase in real estate taxes is primarily due to rate and value increases in certain states and municipalities reflecting those states and municipalities continued economic challenges and the dramatic improvement in apartment values and fundamentals as well as the continued burn off of 421a tax abatements in new york city the increase in utilities is primarily due to a combination of increases in natural gas prices increased consumption of gas and electric due to historically low temperatures and increases in water and sewer costs as many municipalities have antiquated systems with limited revenue for modernization expense growth 

in the core property level expenses excluding real estate taxes and utilities continues to be modest as the company leverages the geographic locations of its new samestore portfolio and technology to lower costs which should partially offset the increase in real estate taxes and utilities 

we believe that the company is wellpositioned as of december 31 2013 because our properties are geographically diverse were approximately 938 occupied 948 on a same store basis and the longterm demographic picture is positive we believe certain market areas especially washington dc downtown boston and cambridge and downtown seattle will see substantial near term multifamily supply yet total new supply levels for our core markets remain within historical ranges we believe over the longer term that our core markets will absorb future supply without material marketwide disruption because of the high occupancy levels we currently experience and increasing household formations we have seen evidence of this in seattle as supply has been absorbed and rental rates continue to grow we believe our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt maturities and development costs in the near term and should also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future 

the current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

results of operations 

in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy the company continued to invest in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  in summary we 

year ended december 31 2013  

 year ended december 31 2012  

 the companys primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the companys apartment communities the cap rate is generally the first year noi yield net of replacements on the companys investment 

properties that the company owned and were stabilized see definition below for all of both 2013  and 2012  the “ 2013   

same store properties” which represented 80247  apartment units impacted the companys results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2012  and 2011  the “ 2012  same store properties” which represented 98577  apartment units also impacted the companys results of operations both the 2013  same store properties and 2012  same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

the following tables provide a rollforward of the apartment units included in same store properties and a reconciliation of apartment units included in same store properties to those included in total properties for the year ended december 31 2013  





note properties are considered stabilized when they have achieved 90 occupancy for three consecutive months properties are included in same store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented 

 the companys acquisition disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  the impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs 

  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2013  to the year ended december 31 2012   

  

for the year ended december 31 2013  the company reported diluted earnings per share of 516  compared to 270  per share for the year ended december 31 2012  the difference is primarily due to higher gains from property sales in 2013 vs 2012 and higher total property net operating income driven by the positive impact of the companys same store and stabilized archstone properties partially offset by 739 million of mergerrelated expenses incurred in connection with the archstone acquisition 1217 million of costs incurred in connection with early debt extinguishment of existing mortgage notes payable to manage the companys post archstone 2017 maturities profile higher depreciation as a direct result of the archstone transaction the issuance of common shares to the public in december 2012 and to an affiliate of lehman brothers holdings inc in february 2013 as partial consideration for the archstone acquisition and the companys recognition of 1500 million in archstonerelated termination fees in 2012 

for the year ended december 31 2013  loss from continuing operations increased approximately 3285 million  when compared to the year ended december 31 2012  the decrease in continuing operations is discussed below 

revenues from the 2013  same store properties increased 760 million  primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents slightly higher occupancy and a decrease in turnover expenses from the 2013  same store properties increased 202 million  primarily due to increases in real estate taxes utilities and repairs and maintenance costs partially offset by lower property management costs the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2013  same store properties 



 the following table provides comparative same store operating expenses for the 2013  same store properties 



 the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income to noi for the 2013  same store properties 



for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1 2013 and expects to continue to own through december 31 2014  as well as the stabilized apartment units acquired in the archstone acquisition the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2014  



the company anticipates consolidated rental acquisitions of 5000 million and consolidated rental dispositions of 5000 million and expects that acquisitions will have a 100 lower cap rate than dispositions for the full year ending december 31 2014  

  

these 2014  assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

nonsame store operating results increased approximately 3773 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2012  and 2013  as well as operations from the company’s completed development properties although the operations of both the nonsame store assets and the same store assets have been positively impacted during the year ended december 31 2013 the nonsame store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total noi to the company’s overall operating results primarily due to 2012 and 2013 acquisitions increasing occupancy for properties in leaseup and a longer ownership period in 2013 than 2012 this increase primarily resulted from 

 46 

see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s segment disclosures 

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses decreased approximately 17 million  or 341  primarily as a result of higher expenses and lower revenue earned on management of the companys military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base partially offset by fees earned on management of the company’s unconsolidated development joint ventures 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased approximately 24 million or 30  this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payrollrelated costs and an increase in computer operations due to the modernization of employee technology partially offset by the timing of legal and professional fees 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 4183 million or 746 primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2013 including the archstone properties development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of furniture fixtures and equipment that were fully depreciated inplace residential lease intangibles are generally amortized over a six month period and can significantly elevate depreciation expense following an acquisition especially during 2013 as a direct result of the archstone acquisition 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 149 million or 316 primarily due to an increase in payrollrelated costs which is largely a result of higher and accelerated longterm compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and higher compensation related to the archstone transaction as well as an increase in office rent the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 500 million to 520 million for the year ending december 31 2014  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

interest and other income from continuing operations decreased 1459 million  or 969  primarily due to the company recognizing 1500 million in archstonerelated termination fees during the year ended december 31 2012  partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of investment securities and technology investments during the year ended december 31 2013 the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate 05 million for the year ending december 31 2014 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

other expenses from continuing operations decreased approximately 126 million or 580 primarily due to the lower property pursuit costs as the company focused on its pursuit of the archstone acquisition 

merger expenses from continuing operations which includes direct costs incurred from the archstone acquisition such as investment banking and legalaccounting costs increased approximately 142 million as a result of the closing of the archstone acquisition during the year ended december 31 2013  

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 1325 million or 278 primarily as a result of the following 

 the above increases to interest expense were partially offset by the following 

 

during the year ended december 31 2013  the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 473 million as compared to 225 million for the year ended december 31 2012  this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects 

under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2013 was 491 excluding 1076 million in net debt extinguishment costs as compared to 537 for the year ended december 31 2012  the company anticipates that interest expense from continuing operations will approximate 4491 million to 4614 million excluding debt extinguishment costs for the year ending december 31 2014  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately 07 million primarily due to increases in taxes related to land parcel sales owned by the companys trs as well as increases in all other taxes the company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate 10 million to 20 million for the year ending december 31 2014  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities due to operations increased by 41 million  as a result of the unconsolidated joint ventures acquired as part of the archstone transaction 

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities due to merger expenses which includes indirect costs incurred from the archstone acquisition through the companys joint ventures with avb increased primarily as a result of severance obligations and retention bonuses in connection with the archstone acquisition through our 60 interest in unconsolidated joint ventures

for the year ended december 31 2012  the company reported diluted earnings per share of 270  compared to 298  per share for the year ended december 31 2011  the difference is primarily due to higher gains from property sales in 2011 vs 2012 partially offset by higher total property net operating income driven by the positive impact of the company’s same store and leaseup activity and the companys recognition of 1500 million in termination fees related to our pursuit of archstone

interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately 1426 million  primarily due to the company recognizing 1500 million in termination fees related to our pursuit of the archstone acquisition during the year ended december 31 2012 partially offset by lower interest earned on cash and cash equivalents due to lower overall cash invested during the year ended december 31 2012 as well as forfeited deposits for terminated disposition transactions proceeds received from the company’s final royalty participation in lrorainmaker a revenue management system and litigation settlement proceeds that all occurred during the year ended december 31 2011 and did not reoccur during the year ended december 31 2012 

other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately 93 million  or 749  primarily due to the settlement of a dispute with the owners of a land parcel an increase in the expensing of overhead pursuit costs writeoffs as a result of a more active focus on sourcing new development opportunities and an increase in property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the companys 2012 acquisitions 

merger expenses from continuing operations which includes direct costs incurred from the archstone acquisition such as investment banking and legalaccounting costs increased approximately 39 million as the company focused on its pursuit of the archstone acquisition which closed in the first quarter of 2013 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 03 million  or 01  primarily as a result of lower interest expense on mortgage notes payable due to lower balances during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 higher capitalized interest in 2012 the redemption of the companys 6500 million of unsecured notes in august 2011 and the repayment of 2539 million of 6625 unsecured notes in march 2012 partially offset by interest expense on the 10 billion of unsecured notes that closed in december 2011 during the year ended december 31 2012 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 225 million as compared to 91 million for the year ended december 31 2011 this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2012 was 537 as compared to 530 for the year ended december 31 2011

the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility under normal operating conditions the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions 

the company has a flexible dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the company’s core business and provide transparency to investors during the year ended december 31 2013  the company paid 040  per share for each of the first three quarters and 065  per share for the fourth quarter to bring the total payment for the year an annual rate of 185 per share to approximately 65 of normalized ffo beginning in 2014 the companys annual dividend will be paid based on 65 of the midpoint of the range of normalized ffo guidance customarily provided as part of the companys fourth quarter earnings release the company expects the annual dividend payout will be 200 per share and the company intends to pay four quarterly dividends of 050 per share in 2014 all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the board of trustees the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking while our current dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate however whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature the companys financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels the company believes that its expected 2014 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions 

the company also expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities including additional op units proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and cash generated from operations after all distributions in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit of the 268 billion in investment in real estate on the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2013  180 billion or 670 was

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate 

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories 

 56 

countertops etc and 

 all replacements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 

 all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset 

for the year ended december 31 2013  our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1358 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts

improvements to real estate and additions to nonreal estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow 

derivative instruments

depreciation of investment in real estate 

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 15year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacement components over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates and changes in the securities industry and financial markets association sifma index for taxexempt debt the company also has foreign exchange exposure related to interests in german residential real estate that were acquired as part of the archstone transaction 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term loan facilities as well as floating rate taxexempt debt the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment to the extent the company carries substantial cash balances this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances the company may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange rate risk related to interests in german residential real estate that were acquired as part of the archstone transaction derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 9 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s 

mortgage notes payable and unsecured debt including its line of credit were approximately 51 billion  and 59 billion  respectively at december 31 2013  

at december 31 2013  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 16 billion  or 153  of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 12 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 20 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 12 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 20 million 

at december 31 2013  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 91 billion  or 847  of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 51 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 83 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 51 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 101 billion 

at december 31 2013  the company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 187 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 33 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 280 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 33 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 94 million 

  

at december 31 2012  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 07 billion or 80 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 14 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 09   million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 14 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 09   million 

at december 31 2012  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 78 billion or 920 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 56 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the companys fixed rate debt would be approximately 71 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 56 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the companys fixed rate debt would be approximately 87 billion 

at december 31 2012  the companys derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 425 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 4 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the companys derivative instruments would be approximately 409 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 4 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the companys derivative instruments would be approximately 442 million 

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

the company invests in high quality apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets our core markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation we are focused primarily on the six core coastal high barrier to entry markets of boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents 

 

for our apartments 

 our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign their leases review their accounts and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture agreements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales the company may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings the company has also in the past converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business 

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entrynoncore markets to high barrier to entrycore markets since 2005 the company has sold over 133000 apartment units primarily in its noncore markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately 111 billion acquired over 44000 apartment units in its core markets for approximately 103 billion and began approximately 30 billion of development projects in its core markets we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas our core markets boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle we also have investments in the aggregate about 158 of our noi at december 31 2012  in other markets including south florida denver and new england excluding boston but do not currently intend to acquire or develop new assets in these markets further we are in the process of exiting atlanta phoenix orlando and jacksonville as we raise capital to complete the archstone transaction 

as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially occupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed we intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets as of december 31 2012  no single metropolitan area accounted for more than 159 of our noi though no guarantee can be made that noi concentration may not increase in the future 

we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education resources and opportunities to succeed we provide many classroom and online training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the property and its improvements equipment and appliances we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions we monitor our employees engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores

competition 

all of the companys properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the companys ability to lease apartment 

units at its properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the companys managers in addition other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors  for additional information with respect to competition

environmental considerations

 item 1a risk factors 

general 

references to eqr mean equity residential a maryland real estate investment trust reit and references to erpop mean erp operating limited partnership an illinois limited partnership unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “company” “we” “us” or “our” mean collectively eqr erpop and those entitiessubsidiaries owned or controlled by eqr andor erpop and the term “operating partnership” means collectively erpop and those entitiessubsidiaries owned or controlled by erpop this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units op units longterm incentive plan units “ltip units” and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units ltip units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own sharesunits opltip units and public unsecured debt as our “security holders” 

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 

general 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value these factors include changes in the global national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes all of which could increase over time sources of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions 

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders however there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds 

from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels while our dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than a fixed dividend policy should operating results deteriorate see item 7 for additional discussion regarding our dividend policy 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire 

when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing rental housing subsidized by the government other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing slow or negative employment growth and household formation the availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond the companys control in addition various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation which could limit our ability to raise rents finally the federal governments policies many of which may encourage home ownership can increase competition and possibly limit our ability to raise rents consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 

new acquisitions andor development projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

we intend to actively acquire andor develop multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues andor lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property additionally we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts this competition or lack thereof may increase or depress prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure the total number of apartment units under development costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

in connection with such government regulation we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance

we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures joint venture investments involve risks including the possibility that our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses that our partners might at any time have business or economic goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partners may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners frequently we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest further the companys joint venture partners may experience financial distress including bankruptcy and to the extent they do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures with them we may be adversely 

affected 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company 

from time to time the company holds investment securities andor cash investments that have various levels of repayment and liquidity risk including government obligations and bond funds money market funds or bank deposits on occasion we also may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank substantially exceeds the fdic insurance limit or we invest cash in money market or similar type funds with investment management institutions resulting in risk to the company of loss of funds if these banks or institutions fail 

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares   

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including but not limited to the following 

 changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders 

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer shareholder employment environmental development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price   

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate as some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted by excluding moldrelated claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property should mold become an issue in the future our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

climate change 

to the extent that climate change does occur we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

insurance policy deductibles exclusions and counterparties 

as of december 31 2012  the companys property insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate selfinsured retention of 75 million with approximately 80 of any excess losses being covered by insurance any earthquake and named windstorm losses in critical areas are subject to a deductible of 5 of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate selfinsured retention the companys general liability and workers compensation policies at december 31 2012  provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses but management has reviewed its claims history over the years and believes the savings in insurance premium expense justify this potential increased exposure over the longterm however the potential impact of climate change and increased severe weather could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and 

deductibles particularly for our coastal properties or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 property insurance carriers created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” property insurance policies as of december 31 2012  under a separate terrorism insurance policy the company was insured for 5000 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio becoming more concentrated in fewer more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint 

as of december 31 2012  the companys cyber liability insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and a 50 million general limit cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers this cyber policy would cover the cost of victim notification credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses 

the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability and workers compensation insurance while there has yet to be any nonperformance by these major insurance providers should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact the company in addition the company annually assesses its insurance needs based on the cost of coverage and other factors we may choose to self insure a greater portion of this risk in the future or may choose to have higher deductibles or lesser policy terms 

nonperformance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties as a result defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided or volatility in the financial markets could affect counterparties ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

debt financing and preferred sharespreference units could adversely affect our performance 

general 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the companys total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31 2012  

in addition to debt we have a liquidation value of 500 million of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interestpreference units with a dividend preference of 829 per annum as of december 31 2012  our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions 

dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly andor to decline 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance 

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored 

enterprises or gses through their lender originator networks the gses are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties should the gses have their mandates changed or reduced materially change their lending terms lose key personnel be disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue providing liquidity to our sector it would significantly reduce our access to secured debt capital andor increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets andor the values realized upon sale disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit markets perception of the gses which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets 

nonperformance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress 

the company also has developed assets with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the facilities and impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders requirements at the lower ratings level 

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the companys debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2012  

financial covenants could adversely affect the companys financial condition 

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and 

unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facilities and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  should it fall out of compliance it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds or otherwise contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions including affordability requirements the company and from time to time its consultants monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities 

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 307  as of december 31 2012  in addition our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows 



rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnerships credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders 

derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow 

in the normal course of business we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments including hedging for future debt issuances at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates we may also use derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates or manage commodity prices in the daily operations of our business there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact these arrangements which can include a number of counterparties may expose us to additional risks including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts and may involve extensive costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate foreign exchange or commodity pricing fluctuations 

we depend on our key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer “ceo” if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 

control and influence by significant security holders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other security holders 

the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the sixth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company although to the companys knowledge these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the companys affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees including mr zell and our executive officers see equity residentials definitive proxy statement 

shareholders ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holders rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the companys ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the companys status as a reit 

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the companys outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out 

of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

the archstone transaction is the largest such transaction in the companys history and exposes us to significant additional risk 

we plan to fund a portion of the cash purchase price of the archstone transaction as well as repay indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with the archstone transaction with capital raised through significant dispositions of assets if we are unable to consummate such dispositions in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all we will likely have to incur greater indebtedness andor issue additional equity securities 

w e currently expect to finance a portion of the cash purchase price of the archstone transaction and to ultimately refinance indebtedness assumed or incurred in connection with the archstone transaction with proceeds generated from the disposition of certain archstone assets and of our assets that we believe are not consistent with our ongoing business strategy or that may be in markets in which we intend to reduce our current presence the amount of such proposed dispositions is significant we can provide no assurance that we will in fact be able to consummate such dispositions at all at a time necessary to apply the proceeds to the archstone transaction or the refinancing of debt or at prices that we would otherwise expect to achieve factors that could limit our ability to successfully dispose of assets include 

 

failure to timely achieve a material portion of our anticipated dispositions would likely require us to incur greater indebtedness to fund the archstone transaction or seek other methods to refinance the debt incurred or assumed in connection with the archstone transaction which involves the risk described herein or issue more equity securities which is subject to execution and pricing risk the failure to successfully execute a material portion of our disposition plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations and distributions to our shareholders 

in addition we plan to defer the taxable gain on certain of our dispositions as exchanges made in connection with the archstone transaction pursuant to section 1031 of the internal revenue code the requirements for qualification under section 1031 are technical and complex to the extent we are unable to defer such gains to the extent anticipated the benefits of such dispositions will be reduced and we could recognize significant taxable gains as a result of such dispositions which would require us to make distributions in excess of our expectations which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

there can be no assurance that the archstone transaction will be consummated in accordance with the anticipated timing or at all 

although we expect to close the archstone transaction in the first quarter of 2013 there can be no assurance that the archstone transaction will be completed in accordance with the anticipated timing or at all the purchase agreement contains closing conditions which may not be satisfied or waived in which case the company and avb andor lehman will not be obligated to complete the archstone transaction in addition under circumstances specified in the purchase agreement the company and avb or lehman may terminate the purchase agreement 

we expect to incur significant additional indebtedness including significant floating rate debt and significant amounts of indebtedness with maturity dates in 2014 in order to consummate the archstone transaction which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and distributions to our shareholders 

we may raise additional funds to finance our portion of the archstone transaction cash purchase price through one or more methods including without limitation from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility proceeds from asset dispositions bank term debt or unsecured debt or equity offerings depending on market conditions we may increase or decrease the anticipated sources of debt financing our obligations under the purchase agreement are not conditioned upon the consummation of any financing transactions 

in connection with the archstone transaction we will also assume significant indebtedness including a significant amount of secured mortgage indebtedness taking into account our existing indebtedness the assumption of indebtedness in the archstone transaction and possible financing plans to fund our portion of the archstone transaction cash purchase price our consolidated indebtedness will materially increase after giving effect to the archstone transaction we may not be able to repay or otherwise refinance such indebtedness when it becomes due and payable which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition if we default under a mortgage loan we may lose the properties securing these loans 

further because a significant amount of the assets we expect to acquire from archstone are secured by mortgage indebtedness and because we intend to dispose of significant amounts of our properties that are currently unencumbered our unencumbered asset pool will be reduced significantly this may increase our costs of raising additional unsecured indebtedness and could significantly limit our financial flexibility 

in addition a significant amount of the indebtedness we expect to incur and assume in connection with the archstone transaction will have floating interest rates rather than fixed interest rates or matures in 2014 to the extent that interest rates increase and we are unable to successfully hedge against rising interest rates our interest expense could increase substantially 

our indebtedness could have additional significant adverse consequences on our business such as 

 

the impact of any of the potential adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity and distributions to our shareholders 

the archstone transaction is expected to be dilutive initially to our earnings and earnings per share 

  

as a result of the issuance of our common shares to lehman as part of the consideration paid in the archstone transaction and the sale of our common shares in 2012 to finance the archstone transaction as well as a result of the expected dispositions necessary to enable us to finance the archstone transaction the archstone transaction is expected to be dilutive to our operating results both on an absolute basis and on a per share basis however the amount of any dilution will depend on a number of factors including the pace of our planned asset sales as discussed above and the ultimate mix of sources used to finance the archstone transaction for example if our disposition plan occurs at a faster pace than anticipated as we currently expect such dispositions will result in more dilution to our revenues net income noi funds from operations and normalized funds from operations 

  

  

we will incur substantial expenses and payments even if the archstone transaction is not completed 

  

we have incurred substantial legal accounting financial advisory and other costs and our management has devoted considerable time and effort in connection with the archstone transaction if the archstone transaction is not completed we will bear certain fees and expenses associated with the archstone transaction without realizing the benefits of the archstone transaction the fees and expenses may be significant and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

the purchase agreement provides for a breakup fee payable by the company and avb of 8000 million if the purchase agreement is terminated under certain circumstances including as a result of a breach by the company and avb of any covenant or agreement under the purchase agreement any payment of the breakup fees would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our liquidity 

  

our obligations under the purchase agreement entered into in the archstone transaction are joint and several with avb the failure of avb to perform its obligations could cause the purchase agreement to be terminated and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

although we have agreed to purchase approximately 60 of the archstone assets in the archstone transaction and avb has agreed to acquire approximately 40 of the archstone assets our obligations under the purchase agreement are joint and several with avb if avb determines not to consummate the archstone transaction we do not have the right to consummate the transaction alone in addition although we expect to be liable only for our pro rata share of any breakup fee or other obligations arising under the purchase agreement approximately 60 pursuant to arrangements with avb in the event avb fails to pay its pro rata share of any such obligations we will be responsible for paying 100 of such obligations as a result the failure of avb to perform its obligations under the purchase agreement would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity and distributions to our shareholders 

  

several of the assets we expect to acquire in the archstone transaction are subject to tax protection agreements which could limit our flexibility with respect to our ownership of such assets 

  

several of the assets we expect to acquire in the archstone transaction were contributed to archstone subject to various agreements limiting the ability of the owner of the property to take actions that would trigger income tax liability for the contributing owner of the property including a taxable disposition of the property in addition we will also be required to maintain a certain amount of qualified nonrecourse financing on the tax protected properties during their respective restricted periods our obligations relating to the tax protected properties may affect the way in which we conduct our business including whether when and under what circumstances we sell properties or interests therein and the timing and nature of our financings and refinancing transactions as a result we may not be able to dispose of or refinance the tax protected properties when to do so may have otherwise been favorable to us and our shareholders which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our business and the market price of our common shares may be adversely affected if the archstone transaction is not completed 

  

the archstone transaction is subject to customary and other closing conditions if the archstone transaction is not completed we could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common shares including 

 

the intended benefits of the archstone transaction may not be realized which could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial conditions the market price of our common shares and our distributions to our shareholders 

  

we may be subject to additional risks and may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the archstone transaction if the transaction is consummated upon completion of the archstone transaction we will need to integrate the properties and 

other assets we acquire from archstone the archstone portfolio with our existing operations the archstone transaction represents the largest acquisition by dollar amount of a property portfolio ever attempted by us we may not be able to accomplish the integration of the archstone portfolio smoothly successfully or within the anticipated costs the diversion of our managements attention from our current operations to integration efforts and any difficulties encountered could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the archstone transaction and could adversely affect our business and the price of our common shares additional risks include among others 

 

we cannot assure you that we would be able to integrate the archstone portfolio without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us failure to realize the intended benefits of the archstone transaction could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition the market price of our common shares and our distributions to our shareholders 

we will increase our concentration of properties in certain core markets as a result of the archstone transaction which could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely affected by economic or other conditions 

as a result of the archstone transaction we will increase our concentration of properties in certain core markets as a result of our strategy to reposition our portfolio from low barrier to entrynoncore markets to high barrier to entrycore markets if any one or more of such core markets such as washington dc southern california new york or san francisco is adversely affected by local or regional economic conditions such as business layoffs industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors or local real estate conditions such as oversupply of or reduced demand for multifamily properties such conditions may have an increased adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse 

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority regarding major decisions our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 

  

a portion of the assets we are acquiring in the archstone transaction are being acquired through joint ventures with avb that neither we nor avb will control solely joint ventures including our proposed joint ventures with avb involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties including the following 

 

 

any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate and recognize attractive returns on our joint venture investments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and distributions to our shareholders 

  

shares eligible for future resale by lehman may depress our share price 

  

we have agreed to issue 34468085 of our common shares to lehman in connection with the archstone transaction we have agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement at the closing of the archstone transaction to cover resales of such shares the resale of substantial amounts of our common shares by lehman in the public markets or even the anticipation of the resale of such shares could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares such an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares would make it more difficult for us to sell our shares in the future at prices which we deem appropriate or to use our shares as currency for future acquisitions 

  

the inability of lehman to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us under the purchase agreement could increase our liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition to certain indemnification obligations of each party to the purchase agreement relating to breaches of fundamental representations and warranties and breaches of covenants and certain other specified matters we have negotiated as a term in the purchase agreement that lehman retain responsibility for and indemnify us against damages resulting from certain thirdparty claims or other liabilities these thirdparty claims and other liabilities include without limitation costs associated with various litigation matters lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in september 2008 and is currently in the process of postpetition liquidation if lehman completes its liquidation prior to the termination of their indemnity obligations to us under the purchase agreement or otherwise distributes substantially all of its assets to its creditors prior to such time lehman may not be able to satisfy its obligations with respect to claims and retained liabilities covered by the purchase agreement the failure of lehman to satisfy such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition because claimants may successfully assert that we are liable for those claims andor retained liabilities in addition we expect that certain obligations of lehman to indemnify us will terminate upon expiration of the applicable indemnification period generally no more than three years following the closing the assertion of thirdparty claims after the expiration of the applicable indemnification period or the failure of lehman to satisfy its indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status however the reit qualification rules permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status there is also risk that congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and 

the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income 

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger 

  compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company 

during 2008 and 2009 we did make and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

federal income tax considerations 

general 

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flowthrough entity for federal income tax purposes 

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult 

with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholders personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

our taxation 

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by our taxable reit subsidiaries 

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis  amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a “taxable reit subsidiary” or “trs” provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 25 of the reits total asset value trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 

penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 

 

to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the  de minimis  test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

asset tests  in general on the last day of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets    

 

securities representing more than 10 of the voting power or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer and 

 the 10 value test described in clause 3b above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis  change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuers debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis  ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis  exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

  annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholders common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholders tax basis such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reits earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

generally our designated capital gain dividends will be broken out into net capital gains distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20 as of january 1 2013 for individual taxpayers in the highest tax bracket and unrecaptured section 1250 gain distributions which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

   

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

taxation of foreign shareholders 

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

 distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

 

if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholders common shares instead the 

distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholders common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholders united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report such distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

 under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholders united states federal income tax liability 

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition if timely requested foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

foreign shareholders sales of common shares   gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

 

 even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

   

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

  

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such persons united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service 

medicare tax on unearned income 

the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 requires certain us shareholders that are taxed as individuals estates or trusts to pay an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares for taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 

withholding on foreign financial institutions and nonus shareholders 

the foreign account tax compliance act of 2009 may impose withholding taxes on certain types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions” and certain other nonus shareholders under this legislation the failure to comply with additional certification information reporting and other specified requirements could result in withholding tax being imposed on payments of dividends and sales proceeds to us shareholders that own their shares through foreign accounts or foreign intermediaries and certain nonus shareholders the legislation imposes a 30 withholding tax on dividends on and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our shares paid to a foreign financial institution or to a foreign nonfinancial entity unless i the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or ii the foreign nonfinancial entity either certifies it does not have any substantial us owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial us owner in addition if the payee is a foreign financial institution it generally must enter into an agreement with the us treasury that requires among other things that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain us persons or usowned foreign entities annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold 30 on payments to certain other account holders proposed regulations have delayed implementation of these rules with respect to payments such as distributions made with respect to our capital stock until january 1 2014 and with respect to payments such as gross proceeds from sales or exchanges of our capital stock until january 1 2015

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

the company invests in high quality apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets our core markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation we are focused primarily on the six core coastal high barrier to entry markets of boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents 

 our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign their leases review their accounts and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture agreements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales the company may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings the company has also in the past converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business 

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entrynoncore markets to high barrier to entrycore markets since 2005 the company has sold over 133000 apartment units primarily in its noncore markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately 111 billion acquired over 44000 apartment units in its core markets for approximately 103 billion and began approximately 30 billion of development projects in its core markets we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas our core markets boston new york washington dc southern california san francisco and seattle we also have investments in the aggregate about 158 of our noi at december 31 2012  in other markets including south florida denver and new england excluding boston but do not currently intend to acquire or develop new assets in these markets further we are in the process of exiting atlanta phoenix orlando and jacksonville as we raise capital to complete the archstone transaction 

as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially occupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed we intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets as of december 31 2012  no single metropolitan area accounted for more than 159 of our noi though no guarantee can be made that noi concentration may not increase in the future 

we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education resources and opportunities to succeed we provide many classroom and online training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the property and its improvements equipment and appliances we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions we monitor our employees engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores 

we have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities we have a dedicated inhouse team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business including investment activities development property operations and property management activities with its high density multifamily housing is by its nature an environmentally friendly property type our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated 

in pedestrianfriendly urban locations near public transportation when developing and renovating our properties we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets we continue to implement a combination of irrigation lighting hvac and renewable energy improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption 

current environment 

on november 26 2012 the company and avalonbay communities inc avalonbay or avb nyseavb entered into a contract with lehman brothers holdings inc lehman to acquire the assets and liabilities of archstone enterprise lp archstone which consists principally of a portfolio of highquality apartment properties in major markets in the united states under the terms of the agreement the company will acquire approximately 60  of archstones assets and liabilities and avalonbay will acquire approximately 40  of archstones assets and liabilities the company will acquire approximately 75  operating properties four properties under development and several land parcels to be held for future development for approximately 89 billion which will consist of cash of approximately 20 billion 34468085 common shares and the assumption of the companys portion of the liabilities related to the archstone assets other than certain liabilities owed to lehman and certain transaction expenses the company also expects to assume approximately 3 billion of consolidated archstone debt in addition the company and avalonbay will acquire certain assets of archstone including archstone’s interests in certain joint ventures interests in a portfolio of properties located in germany and certain development land parcels and will become subject to approximately 1799 million in preferred interests of archstone unitholders through various unconsolidated joint ventures expected to be owned 60 by the company and 40 by avalonbay the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013 

we expect continued growth in 2013 same store revenue anticipated increase ranging from 40 to 50 and 2013 noi anticipated increase ranging from 45 to 60 and are optimistic that the strength in fundamentals realized in the past couple of years and so far in 2013 will be sustained for the foreseeable future we believe the key drivers behind the anticipated increase in revenue are base rent pricing for new residents renewal pricing for existing residents resident turnover and physical occupancy thus far in 2013 base rents are higher as compared with the same period last year and are gradually increasing from normal seasonal lows we expect base rent growth to average 40 to 45 with higher growth during the peak leasing season renewal rates remain strong and are expected to exceed 50 on average throughout the year the significant disposition activity discussed below including exiting certain of our noncore markets will leave a same store set expected to show a decrease in turnover as compared to 2012 although occupancy is higher than anticipated for this time of the year it is expected to remain consistent with last year despite slow growth in the overall economy our business continues to perform well because of the combined forces of demographics household formations and the continued aversion to home ownership all of which should ensure a continued strong demand for rental housing 

the company anticipates that 2013 same store expenses will increase 25 to 35 primarily due to increases in real estate taxes which are expected to increase over 6 in 2013 this is primarily due to rate and value increases in certain states and municipalities reflecting those states and municipalities continued economic challenges and the dramatic improvement in apartment fundamentals the other key driver of this increase is the burn off of 421a tax abatements in new york city very good expense control in the core property level expenses excluding real estate taxes continues as the company leverages technology to lower costs which should partially offset the increase in real estate taxes this exceptional expense control has allowed the company to realize over five years of same store annual expense growth below 30 

while competition for the properties we are interested in acquiring is significant due to continued strength in market fundamentals we are focusing our attention in 2013 on closing the archstone acquisition and integrating its properties and operations we believe our access to capital our ability to execute large complex transactions and our ability to efficiently stabilize large scale lease up properties provide us with a competitive advantage which is demonstrated in the pending archstone transaction the company acquired nine  consolidated properties consisting of 1896  apartment units for 9063 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  the company did not budget for any acquisitions to occur outside of archstone during the year ending december 31 2013  

the company also acquired six  land parcels for 1412 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  the company started construction on two projects inclusive of the companys codevelopment with toll brothers to develop 400 park avenue south in new york city representing 357 apartment units totaling approximately 3060 million of development costs during the year ended december 31 2012  the company currently anticipates starting between 5000 million and 7000 million of new developments in 2013 some of which were delayed from 2012 as we worked on funding for the archstone transaction 

the company continues to sell noncore assets and reduce its exposure to noncore markets as we believe these assets will have lower longterm returns and we can sell them for prices that we believe are favorable the archstone transaction provides an opportunity to accelerate this strategy and do so efficiently through the use of section 1031 tax deferred exchanges the 

company sold 35  consolidated properties consisting of 9012  apartment units for 11 billion  during the year ended december 31 2012  these dispositions combined with reinvestment of the cash proceeds in assets with lower cap rates see definition below were dilutive to our per share results the company defines dilution from transactions as the lost noi from sales proceeds that were not reinvested in other apartment properties or were reinvested in properties with a lower cap rate the company anticipates consolidated dispositions of approximately 40 billion  during the year ending december 31 2013  the company plans to fund a portion of the cash purchase price of the archstone transaction with capital raised through these significant dispositions of assets the company currently anticipates that 35 billion of the projected 40 billion of dispositions for 2013 will occur in the first half of 2013 while this accelerated disposition program will be dilutive to our per share results it should reduce the execution risk on the archstone transaction 

we currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets in december 2012 the company raised 12 billion in equity in a public offering of 21850000 common shares priced at 5475 per share we also raised 1923 million under our atm program in 2012 on january 11 2013 the company replaced its existing 175 billion credit facility with a new 25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing april 1 2018 the company believes that the new facility contains a diversified and strong bank group which increases its balance sheet flexibility going forward on january 11 2013 the company also entered into a new senior unsecured 7500 million delayed draw term loan facility which is currently undrawn and may be drawn anytime on or before july 11 2013 with the completion of these financing activities along with cash on hand the company believes it has sufficient capital available to fund its portion of the archstone acquisition cash price transaction costs and required debt paydowns 

 we believe that cash and cash equivalents securities readily convertible to cash current availability on our revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility and disposition proceeds for 2013 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions including archstone debt maturities and existing development projects through 2013 we expect that our remaining longerterm funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings equity issuances including eqrs atm common share offering program property dispositions joint ventures and cash generated from operations 

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac the “government sponsored enterprises” or “gses” through their lender originator networks the gses are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have a significant impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our disposition assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings such changes may also provide an advantage to us by making the cost of financing single family home ownership more expensive and provide us a competitive advantage given the size of our balance sheet and the multiple sources of capital to which we have access 

  

we believe that the company is wellpositioned as of december 31 2012  because our properties are geographically diverse were approximately 943 occupied  950  on a same store basis and the longterm demographic picture is positive with the exception of the washington dc and seattle market areas and the san jose submarket area of san francisco little new multifamily rental supply will be added to our core markets over the next several years we believe our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt maturities and development costs in the near term and should also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future as economic conditions continue to improve the shortterm nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed along with the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel should allow us to realize even more revenue growth and improvement in our operating results 

the current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

results of operations 

in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy the company continued to invest in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  in summary we 

year ended december 31 2012  

 

weighted average cap rate of 62  the majority of which were in exit or less desirable markets these sales excluding two leveraged partiallyowned assets sold during the third quarter generated an unlevered internal rate of return irr inclusive of management costs of 106 

year ended december 31 2011  

 the companys primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the companys apartment communities the cap rate is generally the first year noi yield net of replacements on the companys investment 

properties that the company owned and were stabilized see definition below for all of both 2012  and 2011  the “ 2012  same store properties” which represented 98577 apartment units impacted the companys results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2011  and 2010  the “ 2011  same store properties” which represented 101312 apartment units also impacted the companys results of operations both the 2012  same store properties and 2011  same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

the following tables provide a rollforward of the apartment units included in same store properties and a reconciliation of apartment units included in same store properties to those included in total properties for the year ended december 31 2012  





note properties are considered stabilized when they have achieved 90 occupancy for three consecutive months properties are included in same store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented 

 the companys acquisition disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  the impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs 

  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2012  to the year ended december 31 2011   

  

for the year ended december 31 2012  the company reported diluted earnings per share of 270 compared to 295 per share for the year ended december 31 2011  the difference is primarily due to higher gains from property sales in 2011 vs 2012 partially offset by higher total property net operating income driven by the positive impact of the company’s same store and leaseup activity and the companys recognition of 1500 million in termination fees related to our pursuit of archstone see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

for the year ended december 31 2012  income from continuing operations increased approximately 2538 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2011  the increase in continuing operations is discussed below 

revenues from the 2012  same store properties increased 975 million  primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents and slightly higher occupancy partially offset by increased turnover expenses from the 2012  same store properties increased 112 million  primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and insurance partially offset by a decrease in utilities the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2012  same store properties 



 the following table provides comparative same store operating expenses for the 2012  same store properties 



 the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to noi for the 2012  same store properties 



for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1 2012 and expects to continue to own through december 31 2013  which is computed based on the portfolio of approximately 80000 apartment units that the company expects to have in its annual same store set after the completion of its planned 2013 dispositions the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2013  



the company anticipates no consolidated rental acquisitions outside of archstone and consolidated rental dispositions of 40 billion and expects that acquisitions will have a 100 lower cap rate than dispositions for the full year ending december 31 2013  

these 2013  assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

nonsame store operating results increased approximately 950 million  and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2011  and 2012  as well as operations from the company’s completed development properties although the operations of both the nonsame store assets and the same store assets have been positively impacted during the year ended december 31 2012  the nonsame store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total noi to the company’s overall operating results primarily due to 2011 and 2012 acquisitions increasing occupancy for properties in leaseup and a longer ownership period in 2012 than 2011 this increase primarily resulted from 

 see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s segment disclosures 

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased approximately 02 million or 34 primarily as a result of fees earned on management of the company’s unconsolidated development joint ventures partially offset by lower revenues earned on management of the companys military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base and higher expenses 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses were consistent between the periods under comparison 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 515 million or 84 primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2011 and 2012  development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of both inplace leases and furniture fixtures and equipment that were fully depreciated 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses increased 

approximately 36 million or 84 primarily due to an increase in payrollrelated costs which is largely a result of the acceleration of longterm compensation expense for retirement eligible employees partially offset by a decrease in office rent the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 550 million  to 580 million  for the year ending december 31 2013  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately 1426 million primarily due to the company recognizing 1500 million in termination fees related to our pursuit of archstone during the year ended december 31 2012 partially offset by lower interest earned on cash and cash equivalents due to lower overall cash invested during the year ended december 31 2012 as well as forfeited deposits for terminated disposition transactions proceeds received from the company’s final royalty participation in lrorainmaker a revenue management system and litigation settlement proceeds that all occurred during the year ended december 31 2011 and did not reoccur during the year ended december 31 2012 the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate 05 million  to 15 million  for the year ending december 31 2013  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately 131 million or 914 primarily due to the settlement of a dispute with the owners of a land parcel an increase in the expensing of overhead pursuit costs writeoffs as a result of a more active focus on sourcing new development opportunities an increase in property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the companys 2012 acquisitions and transaction costs related to the pursuit of archstone 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 20 million or 04 primarily as a result of lower interest expense on mortgage notes payable due to lower balances during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 higher capitalized interest in 2012 the redemption of the companys 6500 million of unsecured notes in august 2011 and the repayment of 2539 million of 6625 unsecured notes in march 2012 partially offset by interest expense on the 10 billion of unsecured notes that closed in december 2011 during the year ended december 31 2012  the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 225 million as compared to 91 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2012  was 537 as compared to 530  for the year ended december 31 2011 the company anticipates that interest expense from continuing operations will approximate 4773 million  to 4988 million  excluding debt extinguishment costs for the year ending december 31 2013  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately 02 million or 260 primarily due to decreases in all other taxes the company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate 15 million  to 25 million  for the year ending december 31 2013  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased as a result of the start of operations at one of the companys unconsolidated development joint ventures 

net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately 42 million due to the gain on sale of a land parcel located in suburban washington dc during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to no land sales during the year ended december 31 2012 

discontinued operations net decreased approximately 3078 million or 351 between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily due to higher gains on sales from dispositions during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2012 properties sold in 2012 reflect operations for a partial period in 2012 in contrast to a full period in 2011 see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2011  to the year ended december 31 2010   

for the year ended december 31 2011  the company reported diluted earnings per share of 295 compared to 095 per share for the year ended december 31 2010  the difference is primarily due to higher gains from property sales in 2011 vs 2010 higher total property net operating income driven by the positive impact of the companys same store and leaseup activity and 454 million in impairment losses in 2010 that did not reoccur in 2011 partially offset by dilution as a result of the net impact of the companys 2010 and 2011 acquisition and disposition activities 

for the year ended december 31 2011  income from continuing operations increased approximately 1609 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2010  the increase in continuing operations is discussed below 

revenues from the 2011  same store properties increased 819 million primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents and an increase in occupancy expenses from the 2011  same store properties increased 35 million  primarily due to increases in property management costs real estate taxes and utilities partially offset by decreases in leasing and advertising costs and insurance the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2011  same store properties

nonsame store operating results increased approximately 1107 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2010  and 2011  as well as operations from the companys completed development properties although the operations of both the nonsame store assets and the same store assets have been positively impacted during the year ended december 31 2011  the nonsame store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total noi to the companys overall operating results primarily due to 2010 and 2011 acquisitions increasing occupancy for properties in leaseup and a longer ownership period in 2011  than 2010  this increase primarily resulted from 

 

 see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the companys segment disclosures 

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased approximately 03 million or 60 primarily due to revenues earned on management of the companys unconsolidated development joint ventures an increase in revenue earned on management of the companys military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base and lower expenses partially offset by the unwinding of four institutional joint ventures during 2010 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased approximately 20 million or 25 this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payrollrelated costs which is largely a result of the creation of the companys central business group which moved administrative functions offsite and increases in legal and professional fees and educationconference expenses 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 311 million or 54 primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2011  development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of furniture fixtures and equipment that were fully depreciated 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 37 million or 93 primarily due to an increase in payrollrelated costs which is largely a result of the acceleration of longterm compensation expense for retirement eligible employees 

impairment from continuing operations decreased approximately 454 million due to an impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter of 2010 on land held for development related to two potential development projects that did not reoccur in 2011 see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately 28 million or 556 primarily as a result of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents due to larger overall cash balances during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the same period in 2010 forfeited deposits for terminated disposition transactions and proceeds received from the companys final royalty participation in lrorainmaker a revenue management system partially offset by insurancelitigation settlement proceeds that occurred during the year ended december 31 2010 and did not reoccur during the year ended december 31 2011 

other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately 25 million or 212 primarily due to an increase in property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the companys 2011 acquisitions as well as transaction costs related to the pursuit of archstone 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 107 million or 23 primarily as a result of a full year of interest expense on the 6000 million of unsecured notes that closed in july 2010 and interest expense on forward starting swaps terminated in conjunction with the issuance of 10 billion of unsecured notes partially offset by lower interest expense on mortgage notes payable due to lower balances during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 during the year ended december 31 2011 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 91 million as compared to 130 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2011 was 530 as compared to 514  for the year ended december 31 2010 

income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately 04 million primarily due to tennessee and texas franchise tax refunds received during the year ended december 31 2010 that did not reoccur during the year ended december 31 2011 partially offset by decreases in all other taxes 

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 07 million compared to the year ended december 31 2010  primarily due to the unwinding of four institutional joint ventures during 2010 

net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 281 million primarily due to the gain on sale and revaluation of seven previously unconsolidated properties that were acquired from the companys joint venture partner and the 

gain on sale for 27 unconsolidated properties that occurred during the year ended december 31 2010 that did not reoccur during the year ended december 31 2011 

net gain on sales of land parcels increased approximately 56 million primarily due to the gain on sale of a land parcel located in suburban washington dc during the year ended december 31 2011 and a loss on sale of a land parcel during the same period in 2010 

discontinued operations net increased approximately 4783 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily due to higher gains from property sales during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010  partially offset by properties sold in 2011 which reflect operations for none of or a partial period in 2011 in contrast to a full or partial period in 2010 see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the companys revolving credit facility under normal operating conditions the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 the company announced a new dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts more closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the company’s core business and provide transparency to investors the company intends to pay an annual cash dividend equal to approximately 65 of normalized ffo for the year during the year ended december 31 2012  the company paid 03375 per share for each of the first three quarters and 07675 per share for the fourth quarter to bring the total payment for the year an annual rate of 178 per share to approximately 65 of normalized ffo the company expects to pay 040 per share for each of the first three quarters of 2013 this represents an increase from the 03375 per share paid in each of the first three quarters of 2012 the company anticipates the expected dividend payout will range from 182 to 189 per share 040 per share for each of the first three quarters with the balance for the fourth quarter for the year ending december 31 2013 all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the board of trustees the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking while our dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than a fixed dividend policy should operating results deteriorate however whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature the companys financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels the company believes that its expected 2013 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions 

the company also expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities including additional op units and proceeds received from the 

disposition of certain properties and joint ventures in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit of the 210 billion  in investment in real estate on the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2012  151 billion or 716 was unencumbered however there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate 

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories 

 

all replacements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 

 all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset 

for the year ended december 31 2012  our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1528 million  this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 

capital expenditures to real estate 

for the year ended december 31 2012   



 for the year ended december 31 2011  our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1445 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 

capital expenditures to real estate 

for the year ended december 31 2011   



 

rehabs primarily kitchens and baths on 5416 apartment units equating to about 7000 per apartment unit rehabbed designed to reposition these assets for higher rental levels in their respective markets 

 for 2013  the company estimates that it will spend approximately 1500 per apartment unit of capital expenditures for the approximately 80000 apartment units that the company expects to have in its annual same store set after the completion of its planned 2013 dispositions inclusive of apartment unit renovationrehab costs or 1150 per apartment unit excluding apartment unit renovationrehab costs for 2013  the company estimates that it will spend 408 million rehabbing 5000 apartment units equating to about 8150 per apartment unit rehabbed the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

during the year ended december 31 2012  the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 88 million the company expects to fund approximately 42 million in total additions to nonreal estate property in 2013  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

improvements to real estate and additions to nonreal estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow 

derivative instruments 

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments the company may also use derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates should the archstone transaction close or manage commodity prices in the daily operations of the business 

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place 

see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31 2012

as of december 31 2012  the company has six consolidated projects including 400 park avenue south in new york city which the company is jointly developing with toll brothers – see note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion totaling 1536 apartment units and two unconsolidated projects totaling 945  apartment units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through june 30 2015 as well as other completed development projects that are in various stages of lease up or are stabilized the development agreements currently in place are discussed in

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2012  and are consistent with the year ended december 31 2011  

the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the five critical accounting policies are 

acquisition of investment properties 

the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 

impairment of longlived assets 

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions and legal and environmental concerns as well as the company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an 

impairment loss is warranted 

depreciation of investment in real estate 

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 15year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

cost capitalization 

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate  section for a discussion of the company’s policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 

for all development projects the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as constructioninprogress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 

during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the company capitalized 143 million  116 million  and 107 million  respectively of payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the supervision of development activities as well as major capital andor renovation projects 

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates and changes in the securities industry and financial markets association sifma index for taxexempt debt if the archstone transaction is consummated the company will have foreign exchange exposure related to interests in german residential real estate 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term loan facilities as well as floating rate taxexempt debt the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment to the extent the company carries substantial cash balances this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances the company may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange rate risk related to interests in german residential real estate if the archstone transaction closes derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 9 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets lines of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately 43 billion and 52 billion  respectively at december 31 2012  

at december 31 2012  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 07 billion or 80 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 14 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 09 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 14 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 09 million 

at december 31 2012  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 78 billion or 920 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 56 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 71 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 56 basis points a 10 decrease 

from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 87 billion 

at december 31 2012  the company’s deri vative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 425 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 4 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 409 million if  market rates of interest permanently decreased b y 4 basis points  a 10 decrease from the company’s exis ting weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 442 million 

  

at december 31 2011  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 13 billion or 138 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 14 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 18   million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 14 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 18   million 

at december 31 2011  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 84 billion or 862 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 57 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the companys fixed rate debt would be approximately 76 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 57 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the companys fixed rate debt would be approximately 93 billion 

at december 31 2011  the companys derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 233 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 8 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the companys derivative instruments would be approximately 208 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 8 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the companys derivative instruments would be approximately 259 million 

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

the company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign their lease review their account and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

we seek to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature one or more of the following 

 acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture agreements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales the company may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings the company has also in the past converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business 

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entrynoncore markets to high barrier to entrycore markets since 2005 the company has sold over 124000 apartment units primarily in its noncore markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately 100 billion acquired over 42000 apartment units in its core markets for approximately 94 billion and began approximately 27 billion of development projects in its core markets we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas boston new york washington dc south florida southern california san francisco and seattle we also have investments in the aggregate about 192 of our noi at december 31 2011  in other markets including denver atlanta phoenix new england excluding boston orlando and jacksonville but do not currently intend to acquire or develop new assets in these markets 

as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially occupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed we intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets as of december 31 2011  no single metropolitan area accounted for more than 153 of our noi though no guarantee can be made that noi concentration may not increase in the future 

we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education resources and opportunities to succeed we provide many classroom and online training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the equipment and appliances on our property sites we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions we monitor our employees engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores 

we have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities we have a dedicated inhouse team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business including transactions property operations and property management activities with its high density multifamily housing is by its nature an environmentally friendly property type our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrianfriendly urban locations near public transportation when developing and renovating our properties we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets we continue to implement a combination of irrigation lighting and hvac improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption 

competition 

all of the companys properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the companys ability to lease apartment units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the companys managers in addition other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors  for additional information with respect to competition

credit facilities 

eqr does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the operating partnership eqr guarantees the operating partnerships revolving credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility 

in july 2011 the company replaced its then existing unsecured revolving credit facility with a new 125 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on july 13 2014  subject to a oneyear extension option exercisable by the company the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 5000 million  by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on advances under the new credit facility will generally be libor plus a spread currently 115  and the company pays an annual facility fee of 02  both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the companys longterm debt this facility replaced the companys existing 1425 billion  facility which was scheduled to mature in february 2012  

 as of december 31 2011  the amount available on the new credit facility was 122 billion  net of 318 million  which was restricteddedicated to support letters of credit and there was no amount outstanding during the year ended december 31 2011  the weighted average interest rate was 142  as of december 31 2010  the amount available on the old credit facility was 128 billion  net of 1473 million  which was restricteddedicated to support letters of credit and net of 750 million  which had been committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and was not available for borrowing and there was no amount outstanding during the year ended december 31 2010  the weighted average interest rate was 066

environmental considerations 

see item 1a risk factors  for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

general 

references to eqr mean equity residential a maryland real estate investment trust reit and references to erpop mean erp operating limited partnership an illinois limited partnership unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “company” “we” “us” or “our” mean collectively eqr erpop and those entitiessubsidiaries owned or controlled by eqr andor erpop and the term “operating partnership” means collectively erpop and those entitiessubsidiaries owned or controlled by erpop this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference units limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” longterm incentive plan units “ltip units” and our public unsecured debt in this section we refer to the shares preference units op units ltip units and public unsecured debt together as our “securities” and the investors who own sharesunits opltip units and public unsecured debt as our “security holders” 

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 

general 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value these factors include changes in the global national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes all of which could increase over time sources of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions 

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders however there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels while our dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than a fixed dividend policy should operating results deteriorate see item 7 for additional discussion regarding our dividend policy 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire 

when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing rental housing subsidized by the government other 

government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing slow or negative employment growth and household formation the availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond the companys control in addition various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation which could limit our ability to raise rents finally the federal governments policies many of which may encourage home ownership can increase competition and possibly limit our ability to raise rents consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 

new acquisitions andor development projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

we intend to actively acquire andor develop multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues andor lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property additionally we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts this competition or lack thereof may increase or depress prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure the total number of apartment units under development costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

in connection with such government regulation we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance 

risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures joint venture investments involve risks including the possibility that our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses that our partners might at any time have business or economic goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partners may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest further the companys joint venture partners may experience financial distress including bankruptcy and to the extent they do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures with them we may be adversely affected 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company 

from time to time the company holds investment securities andor cash investments that have a higher risk profile than the government obligations and bond funds money market funds or bank deposits in which we generally invest on occasion we may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank exceeds the fdic insurance limit resulting in risk to the company of loss of funds if these banks fail 

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares   

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including but not limited to the following 

 changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders 

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer employment environmental development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price   

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate as some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted by excluding moldrelated claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property should mold become an issue in the future our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

climate change 

to the extent that climate change does occur we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

insurance policy deductibles exclusions and counterparties 

as of december 31 2011  the companys property insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate selfinsured retention of 75 million with approximately 80 of any excess losses being covered by insurance any earthquake and named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of 5 of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate selfinsured retention the companys general liability and workers compensation policies at december 31 2011 provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses but management has reviewed its claims history over the years and believes the savings in insurance premium expense justify this potential increased exposure over the longterm however the potential impact of climate change and increased severe weather could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles particularly for our coastal properties or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 property insurance carriers created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” property insurance policies as of december 31 2011  under a separate terrorism insurance policy the company was insured for 5000 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio becoming more concentrated in fewer more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint 

as of december 31 2011 the companys cyber liability insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and a 50 million general limit cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers this cyber policy would cover the cost of victim notification credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses 

in addition the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability and workers compensation insurance while there has yet to be any nonperformance by these major insurance providers should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact the company 

nonperformance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties as a result defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided or volatility in the financial 

markets could affect counterparties ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

debt financing and preferred sharespreference units could adversely affect our performance

in addition to debt we have 2000 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interestpreference units with a weighted average dividend preference of 693 per annum as of december 31 2011  our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions 

dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate significantly andor to decline 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance 

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored enterprises or gses should the gses have their mandates changed or reduced lose key personnel be disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue providing liquidity to our sector it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital andor increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets andor the values realized upon sale disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit markets perception of the gses which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets 

nonperformance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress 

the company also has developed assets with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties 

  

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the facility and impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders requirements at the lower ratings level 

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

please refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the companys debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2011  

financial covenants could adversely affect the companys financial condition 

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facilities and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  should it fall out of compliance it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions the company and from time to time its consultants monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities 

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 351 as of december 31 2011  in addition our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows 



rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnerships credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders 

derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow 

in the normal course of business we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments including hedging for future debt issuances at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact these arrangements which can include a number of counterparties may expose us to additional risks including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts and may involve extensive costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 

we depend on our key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer “ceo” if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 

control and influence by significant security holders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other security holders 

the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the sixth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company although to the companys knowledge these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the companys affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees including mr zell and our executive officers see equity residentials definitive proxy statement 

shareholders ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below while our existing preferred sharespreference units do not have these provisions any future series of preferred sharespreference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons 

acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holders rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the companys ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the companys status as a reit 

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the companys outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status in addition congress and the irs have recently liberalized the reit qualification rules to permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income 

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “subchapter c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger 

  compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company 

during 2008 and 2009 we did make and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the reit tax code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

federal income tax considerations 

general 

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flowthrough entity for federal income tax purposes 

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholders personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury 

regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

our taxation 

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by our taxable reit subsidiaries 

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis  amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a “taxable reit subsidiary” or “trs” provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 25 of the reits total asset value trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale 

of condominium units 

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 

 to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the de minimis  test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

asset tests  in general at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets 

 

the 10 value test described in clause 3 b above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis  change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuers debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis  ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis  exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

  annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common 

shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders for tax years ending on or before december 31 2012 these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholders common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholders tax basis such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reits earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15 rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution a 15 rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15 which 15 rate is currently scheduled to increase to 20 for taxable years beginning on and after january 1 2013 an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

   

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less 

determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

taxation of foreign shareholders 

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

 distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

 if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholders common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholders common shares the tax treatment of 

this gain is described below 

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholders united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report such distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

 under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholders united states federal income tax liability 

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition if timely requested foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

foreign shareholders sales of common shares   gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

 

be subject to a 30 tax on the individuals capital gains 

even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

 if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such persons united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service 

medicare tax on unearned income 

the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 requires certain us shareholders that are taxed as individuals estates or trusts to pay an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares for taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 

withholding on foreign financial institutions and nonus shareholders 

the foreign account tax compliance act of 2009 may impose withholding taxes on certain types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions” and certain other nonus shareholders under this legislation the failure to comply with additional certification information reporting and other specified requirements could result in withholding tax being imposed on payments of dividends and sales proceeds to us shareholders that own their shares through foreign accounts or foreign intermediaries and certain nonus shareholders the legislation imposes a 30 withholding tax on dividends on and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our shares paid to a foreign financial institution or to a foreign nonfinancial entity unless i the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or ii the foreign nonfinancial entity either certifies it does not have any substantial us owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial us owner in addition if the payee is a foreign financial institution it generally must enter into an agreement with the us treasury that requires among other things that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain us persons or usowned foreign entities annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold 30 on payments to certain other account holders the legislation applies to payments made after december 31 2012

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

the company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties costeffectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew 

their leases upon expiration while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to sign their lease review their account and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

we seek to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature one or more of the following 

 acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt sales of properties and joint venture agreements in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales the company may acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings the company has also in the past converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business 

over the past several years the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entrynoncore markets to high barrier to entrycore markets since 2005 the company has sold over 124000 apartment units primarily in its noncore markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately 100 billion acquired over 42000 apartment units in its core markets for approximately 94 billion and began approximately 27 billion of development projects in its core markets we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas boston new york washington dc south florida southern california san francisco and seattle we also have investments in the aggregate about 192 of our noi at december 31 2011  in other markets including denver atlanta phoenix new england excluding boston orlando and jacksonville but do not currently intend to acquire or develop new assets in these markets 

as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially occupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed we intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets as of december 31 2011  no single metropolitan area accounted for more than 153 of our noi though no guarantee can be made that noi concentration may not increase in the future 

we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education resources and opportunities to succeed we provide many classroom and online training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the equipment and appliances on our property sites we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions we monitor our employees engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores 

we have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities we have a dedicated inhouse team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business including transactions property operations and property management activities with its high density multifamily housing is by its nature an environmentally friendly property type our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrianfriendly urban locations near public transportation when developing and renovating our properties we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets we continue to implement a combination of irrigation lighting and hvac improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption 

current environment 

 we expect strong growth in 2012 same store revenue anticipated increase ranging from 50 to 60 and 2012 noi anticipated increase ranging from 65 to 85 and are optimistic that the strength in fundamentals realized in 2011 will be sustained for the foreseeable future we believe the key drivers behind the anticipated increases in revenue are base rent pricing renewal pricing resident turnover and physical occupancy despite extremely slow growth in the overall economy our business continues to perform well as evidenced by rising base and renewal rents our relatively stable turnover and solid occupancy which we anticipate will continue throughout 2012 provide us with the ability to increase rental rates the combined forces of demographics household formations and the continued aversion to home ownership should ensure a continued strong demand for rental housing 

the company anticipates that 2012 same store expenses will increase 15 to 25 primarily due to increases in real estate taxes utilities and payroll real estate taxes are expected to increase 40 to 50 in 2012 most significantly due to the burn off of 421a tax abatements in new york city but also due to expected value and rate increases in some of our jurisdictions utilities are expected to grow 15 to 25 in 2012 as increases in water sewer and trash are partially offset by decreases in natural gas rates onsite payroll is expected to increase by approximately 10 in 2012 as normal annual merit increases in payroll should be mitigated by improvements in technology and automation this follows several years of excellent expense control with a compounded annual growth in same store expenses of approximately 10 over the last five years 

 the company continues to sell noncore assets and reduce its exposure to noncore markets as we believe these assets do not fit into our long term plans and we can sell them for prices that we believe are favorable the company sold 47 consolidated properties consisting of 14345 apartment units for 148 billion during the year ended december 31 2011 the companys decision to accelerate the timing and increase the volume of dispositions combined with reinvestment of the cash proceeds in assets with lower cap rates see definition below later in 2011 was dilutive to our 2011 per share results the company defines dilution from transactions as the lost noi from sales proceeds that were not reinvested in other apartment properties or were reinvested in properties with a lower cap rate the company anticipates consolidated dispositions of approximately 125 billion during the year ended december 31 2012 

 competition for the properties we are interested in acquiring is significant due to the overall improvement in market fundamentals we believe our access to capital our ability to execute large complex transactions and our ability to efficiently stabilize large scale lease up properties provide us with a competitive advantage the company acquired 21 consolidated properties consisting of 6198 apartment units for 138 billion and one commercial building for potential redevelopment for 118 million the company anticipates consolidated acquisitions of approximately 125 billion during the year ended december 31 2012 

  

the company also acquired six land parcels and entered into a longterm ground lease on another land parcel for 2023 million during the year ended december 31 2011 we acquired these land parcels with the intent to develop them into approximately 7250 million of new apartment properties the company also started construction on six projects representing 2124 apartment units totaling 6561 million during the year ended december 31 2011 the company expects to start construction on eight projects representing 2014 apartment units totaling approximately 7500 million of development costs during the year ended december 31 2012 

on december 2 2011 the company entered into a contract with affiliates of bank of america and barclays plc to acquire for 1325 billion  half of their interests  an approximately 265  interest overall  in archstone a privatelyheld owner operator and developer of multifamily apartment properties on january 20 2012 lehman brothers the other owner of archstone acquired this 265  interest pursuant to a right of first offer and as a result the companys contract with the sellers was terminated the company now has the exclusive right exercisable on or before april 19 2012 to contract to purchase the remaining 265  interest in archstone owned by the same sellers for a price determined by the company equal to 1485 billion or higher any purchase of the remaining interest by the company would also be subject to lehmans right of first offer and if lehman were to exercise such right the company would be entitled to a breakup fee of 800 million  subject to repayment in certain limited circumstances in 2011 the company incurred archstonerelated expenses of approximately 44 million  approximately 26 million  of this total was financingrelated and 18 million  was pursuit costs     

we currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets in december 2011 the company completed a 10 billion unsecured ten year note offering with a coupon of 4625 and an allin effective interest rate of approximately 62 we also raised 2019 million in equity under our atm common share offering program in 2011 and raised an additional 1236 million under this program thus far in 2012 in july 2011 the company replaced its then existing unsecured revolving credit facility which was due to mature in february 2012 with a new 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on july 13 2014 subject to a oneyear extension option exercisable by the company the company believes that the new facility contains a diversified and strong bank group which increases its 

balance sheet flexibility going forward subsequent to the year ended december 31 2011 the company amended this facility to increase available borrowings by 5000 million to 175 billion and entered into a commitment for a new senior unsecured 5000 million  delayed draw term loan facility the company arranged these facilities to replace a commitment for a 10 billion senior unsecured bridge loan facility and represents access to certain but contingent capital should the company be successful in its pursuit of archstone these facilities are also available for other funding obligations should the company be unsuccessful in its pursuit of archstone 

we believe that cash and cash equivalents securities readily convertible to cash current availability on our revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility and disposition proceeds for 2012 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions including an interest in archstone debt maturities and existing development projects through 2012 we expect that our remaining longerterm funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings equity issuances including eqrs atm common share offering program property dispositions joint ventures and cash generated from operations 

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac the “government sponsored enterprises” or “gses” through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the companys properties the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities any changes to their mandates reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have a significant impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our disposition assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings such changes may also provide an advantage to us by making the cost of financing single family home ownership more expensive and provide us a competitive advantage given the size of our balance sheet and the multiple sources of capital to which we have access 

  

we believe that the company is wellpositioned as of december 31 2011 because our properties are geographically diverse were approximately 942 occupied 947 on a same store basis and the longterm demographic picture is positive with the exception of the washington dc market area little new multifamily rental supply will be added to our markets over the next several years we believe our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt maturities and development costs in the near term and should also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future as economic conditions continue to improve the shortterm nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed along with the customer service and superior value provided by our onsite personnel should allow us to realize even more revenue growth and improvement in our operating results 

the current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

results of operations 

in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy the company continued to invest in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  in summary we

comparison of the year ended december 31 2011  to the year ended december 31 2010   

for the year ended december 31 2011  the company reported diluted earnings per share of 295 compared to 095 per share for the year ended december 31 2010  the difference is primarily due to higher gains from property sales in 2011  vs 2010  higher total property net operating income driven by the positive impact of the company’s same store and leaseup activity and 454 million in impairment losses in 2010 that did not reoccur in 2011 partially offset by dilution as a result of the net impact of the companys 2010 and 2011 acquisition and disposition activities 

for the year ended december 31 2011  income from continuing operations increased approximately 1674 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2010  the increase in continuing operations is discussed below 

revenues from the 2011  same store properties increased 819 million primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents and an increase in occupancy expenses from the 2011  same store properties increased 35 million primarily due to increases in property management costs real estate taxes and utilities partially offset by decreases in leasing and advertising costs and insurance the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2011  same store properties

for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1 2011 and expects to continue to own through december 31 2012 the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2012  



the company anticipates consolidated rental acquisitions of 125 billion and consolidated rental dispositions of 125 billion and expects that acquisitions will have a 125 lower cap rate than dispositions for the full year ending december 31 2012  

these 2012  assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

nonsame store operating results increased approximately 1107 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2010  and 2011  as well as operations from the company’s completed development properties although the operations of both the nonsame store assets and the same store assets have been positively impacted during the year ended december 31 2011  the nonsame store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total noi to the company’s overall operating results primarily due to 2010 and 2011 acquisitions increasing occupancy for properties in leaseup and a longer ownership period in 2011 than 2010 this increase primarily resulted from 

 see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s segment disclosures 

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased approximately 03 million or 60 primarily due to revenues earned on management of the company’s unconsolidated development joint ventures an increase in revenue earned on management of the companys military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base and lower expenses partially offset by the unwinding of four institutional joint ventures during 2010 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased approximately 20 million or 26 this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payrollrelated costs which is largely a result of the creation of the company’s central business group which moved certain administrative functions offsite and increases in legal and professional fees and educationconference expenses 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 338 million or 55 primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2011  development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of furniture fixtures and equipment that were fully depreciated 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 37 million or 93 primarily due to an increase in payrollrelated costs which is largely a result of the acceleration of longterm compensation expense for retirement eligible employees the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 450 million to 460 million for the year ending december 31 2012  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

impairment from continuing operations decreased approximately 454 million due to an impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter of 2010 on land held for development related to two potential development projects that did not reoccur in 2011 see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately 28 million or 544 primarily as a result of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents due to larger overall cash balances during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 forfeited deposits for terminated disposition transactions and proceeds received from the company’s final royalty participation in lrorainmaker a revenue management system partially offset by insurancelitigation settlement proceeds that occurred during the year ended december 31 2010 and did not reoccur during the year ended december 31 2011 the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate 05 million to 10 million for the year ending december 31 2012  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately 26 million or 220 primarily due to an increase in property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the company’s 2011 acquisitions as well as transaction costs related to the pursuit of archstone 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 78 million or 16 primarily as a result of a full year of interest expense on the 6000 million of unsecured notes that closed in july 2010 and interest expense on forward starting swaps terminated in conjunction with the issuance of 10 billion of unsecured notes partially offset by lower interest expense on mortgage notes payable due to lower balances during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 during the year ended december 31 2011  the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 91 million as compared to 130 million for the year ended december 31 2010  this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2011  was 530 as compared to 514 for the year ended december 31 2010 the company anticipates that interest expense from continuing operations will approximate 4580 million to 4680 million for the year ending december 31 2012  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately 04 million primarily due to tennessee and texas franchise tax refunds received during the year ended december 31 2010 that did not reoccur during the year ended december 31 2011 partially offset by decreases in all other taxes the company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate 05 million to 15 million for the year ending december 31 2012  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 07 million compared to the year ended december 31 2010 primarily due to the unwinding of four institutional joint ventures during 2010 

net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 281 million primarily due to the gain on sale and revaluation of seven previously unconsolidated properties that were acquired from the company’s joint venture partner and the gain on sale for 27 unconsolidated properties that occurred during the year ended december 31 2010 that did not reoccur during the year ended december 31 2011

discontinued operations net increased approximately 4718 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily due to higher gains from property sales during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 partially offset by properties sold in 2011 which reflect operations for none of or a partial period in 2011 in contrast to a full or partial period in 2010 see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2010  to the year ended december 31 2009   

for the year ended december 31 2010  the company reported diluted earnings per share of 095 compared to 127 per share for the year ended december 31 2009  the difference is primarily due to 373 million in lower gains from property sales in 2010  vs 2009  and 343 million in higher impairment losses in 2010  vs 2009  

for the year ended december 31 2010  loss from continuing operations increased approximately 257 million when 

compared to the year ended december 31 2009  the decrease in continuing operations is discussed below 

revenues from the 2010  same store properties decreased 21 million primarily as a result of a decrease in average rental rates charged to residents partially offset by an increase in occupancy expenses from the 2010  same store properties increased 62 million primarily due to increases in repairs and maintenance expenses mostly due to greater stormrelated costs such as snow removal and roof repairs incurred during the first quarter of 2010 higher property management costs and increases in utility costs partially offset by lower real estate taxes and leasing and advertising expenses the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2010  same store properties

business while the operations of the nonsame store assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended december 31 2010  similar to the same store assets the nonsame store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total noi to the companys overall operating results primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in leaseup and a longer ownership period in 2010  than 2009  this increase primarily resulted from 

 see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the companys segment disclosures 

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased approximately 15 million or 492 primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the companys military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base primarily due to increased housing redevelopment on the base which earned the company additional fees as well as a decrease in asset management expenses partially offset by the unwinding of the companys institutional joint ventures during 2010

interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately 114 million or 688 primarily as a result of a decrease in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment securities due to lower interest rates during the year ended december 31 2010  and lower overall balances as well as gains on debt extinguishment and the sale of investment securities recognized during the year ended december 31 2009 that did not reoccur in 2010 partially offset by an increase in insurancelitigation settlement proceeds 

other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately 55 million or 842 primarily due to an increase in the expensing of overhead pursuit cost writeoffs as a result of the companys decision to reduce its development activities in prior periods as well as an increase in property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the companys significantly higher acquisition volume in 2010

the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the companys revolving credit facility under normal operating conditions the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions however there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature the company’s financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 the company announced a new dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts more closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the company’s core business and provide transparency to investors the company intends to pay an annual cash dividend equal to approximately 65 of normalized ffo for the year during the year ended december 31 2011 the company paid 03375 per share for each of the first three quarters and 05675 per share for the fourth quarter to bring the total payment for the year an annual rate of 158 per share to approximately 65 of normalized ffo the company anticipates the expected dividend payout will range from 174 to 181 per share 03375 per share for each of the first three quarters with the balance for the fourth quarter for the year ending december 31 2012 all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the board of trustees the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking while our dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than a fixed dividend policy should operating results deteriorate the company believes that its expected 2012 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions 

the company also expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities including additional op units and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit of the 204 billion in investment in real estate on the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2011 139 billion or 683 was unencumbered however there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise

see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to december 31 2011  

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate 

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories 

 all replacements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 

 all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset 

for the year ended december 31 2011  our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1445 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 

capital expenditures to real estate 

for the year ended december 31 2011   



 for the year ended december 31 2010  our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1382 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 

capital expenditures to real estate 

for the year ended december 31 2010   



 for 2012  the company estimates that it will spend approximately 1225 per apartment unit of capital expenditures for its same store properties inclusive of apartment unit renovationrehab costs or 850 per apartment unit excluding apartment unit renovationrehab costs for 2012  the company estimates that it will spend 392 million rehabbing 4700 apartment units equating to about 8300 per apartment unit rehabbed the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

during the year ended december 31 2011  the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 71 million the company expects to fund approximately 67 million in total additions to nonreal estate property in 2012  the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

improvements to real estate and additions to nonreal estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place 

see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31 2011

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

the company admitted an 80  institutional partner to two  separate entitiestransactions one in december 2010 and the other in august 2011 each owning a developable land parcel in exchange for 401 million  in cash and retained a 20  equity interest in both of these entities these land parcels are now unconsolidated total project costs are approximately 2328 million  and construction will be predominantly funded with two separate longterm nonrecourse secured loans from the partner while the company is the managing member of both of the joint ventures is responsible for constructing both of the projects and has given certain construction cost overrun guarantees all major decisions are made jointly the large majority of funding is provided by the partner and the partner has significant involvement in and oversight of the ongoing projects the companys remaining funding obligations are currently estimated at 54 million  the companys strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its financial risk related to the development of the properties however management does not believe that these investments have a materially different impact upon the companys liquidity cash flows capital resources credit or market risk than its other consolidated development activities 

in december 2011 the company acquired a vacant land parcel at 400 park avenue south in new york city in a joint venture with toll brothers nyse tol until the core and shell of the building is complete the building and land will be owned jointly and are required to be consolidated on the companys balance sheet thereafter the company will solely own and control the rental portion of the building floors 222 and toll brothers will solely own and control the for sale portion of the building floors 2340 once the core and shell are complete the toll brothers portion of the property will be deconsolidated from the companys balance sheet the acquisition was financed through contributions by the company and toll brothers of approximately 1025 million and 757 million respectively which included a land purchase price of 761 million  and 579 million  respectively and taxes and fees of 04 million and 03 million respectively deposits were made to the venture of 260 million and 175 million respectively to collateralize construction guarantees management does not believe that this investment has a materially different impact upon the companys liquidity cash flows capital resources credit or market risk than its other consolidated development activities 

as of december 31 2011  the company has six consolidated projects totaling 1535 apartment units and two unconsolidated projects totaling 945 apartment units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through march 31 2014 as well as other completed development projects that are in various stages of lease up or are stabilized the development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in note 16 of the company’s consolidated financial statements

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of december 31 2011  



 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2011  and are consistent with the year ended december 31 2010  

the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the five critical accounting policies are 

acquisition of investment properties 

the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 

impairment of longlived assets 

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions and legal and environmental concerns as well as the company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

depreciation of investment in real estate 

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 15year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

cost capitalization 

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate  section for a discussion of the company’s policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 

for all development projects the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as constructioninprogress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 

funds from operations and normalized funds from operations 

for the year ended december 31 2011  funds from operations “ffo” available to common shares and units  units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units  units increased 1294 million or 208 and 772 million or 113 respectively as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  for the year ended december 31 2010 ffo available to common shares and units  units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units  units increased 73 million or 12 and 209 million or 32 respectively as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 

the following is the companys and the operating partnerships reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and units  units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units  units for each of the five years ended december 31 2011

to common shares and units  units can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies the company also believes that normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units  units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the company’s operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the company’s actual operating results ffo ffo available to common shares and units  units normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units  units do not represent net income net income available to common shares  units or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore ffo ffo available to common shares and units  units normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units  units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income net income available to common shares  units or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity the company’s calculation of ffo ffo available to common shares and units  units normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units  units may differ from other real estate companies due to among other items variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and accordingly may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates and changes in the securities industry and financial markets association sifma index for taxexempt debt the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term loan facilities as well as floating rate taxexempt debt the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment to the extent the company carries substantial cash balances this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 9 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets lines of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately 43 billion and 60 billion respectively at december 31 2011  

at december 31 2011  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 13 billion or 138 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 14 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 18 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 14 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 18 million 

at december 31 2011  the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 84 billion or 862 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 57 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 76 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 57 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 93 billion 

at december 31 2011  the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 233 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 8 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 208 million if market 

rates of interest permanently decreased by 8 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 259 million 

  

at december 31 2010 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 17 billion or 175 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 14 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 24   million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 14 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 24   million 

at december 31 2010 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 82 billion or 825 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 57 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the companys fixed rate debt would be approximately 75 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 57 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the companys fixed rate debt would be approximately 91 billion 

at december 31 2010 the companys derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 233 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 12 basis points a 10 increase from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the companys derivative instruments would be approximately 98 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 12 basis points a 10 decrease from the companys existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the companys derivative instruments would be approximately 370 million 

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

 

the company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

 

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by driving qualified resident prospects to our properties converting this traffic costeffectively into new leases at the highest rent possible keeping our residents satisfied and renewing their leases at yet higher rents while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is our customer service that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to review their account and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

 

we seek to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature one or more of the following 

 

  

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt securities sales of properties joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales eqr may also acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings the company has also in the past converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business 

 

the company primarily sources the funds for its new property acquisitions in its core markets with the sales proceeds from selling assets that are older or located in noncore markets during the last five years the company has sold over 97000 apartment units for an aggregate sales price of 72 billion and acquired nearly 25000 apartment units in its core markets for approximately 55 billion we are currently acquiring and developing assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas boston new york washington dc south florida southern california san francisco seattle and to a lesser extent denver we also have investments in the aggregate about 18 of our noi in other markets including atlanta phoenix portland oregon new england excluding boston tampa orlando and jacksonville but do not intend to acquire or develop assets in these markets 

 

as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially unoccupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed we intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets currently no single metropolitan area accounts for more than 17 of our noi though no guarantee can be made that noi concentration may not increase in the future 

 

we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education resources and opportunities to succeed we provide many classroom and online training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the equipment and appliances on our property sites we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions we monitor our employees’ engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores 

 

we have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities with its high density multifamily housing is by its nature an environmentally friendly property type our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrianfriendly urban locations near public transportation when developing and renovating our properties we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets we continue to implement a combination of irrigation lighting and hvac improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption

competition 

 

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease apartment units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors for additional information with respect to competition 

 

environmental considerations

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

general 

 

the following risk factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “we” and “us” refer to equity residential and its subsidiaries including erp operating limited partnership this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” and long term incentive plan units “ltip units” in this section we refer to the shares op units and ltip units together as our “securities” and the investors who own shares andor opltip units as our “security holders” 

 

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 

 

general 

 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value these factors include changes in the global national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes all of which could increase over time sources of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

 

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our new dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions 

 

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders however there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels while our new dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than in the past should operating results deteriorate see item 7 for additional discussion regarding our new dividend policy 

 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire 

 

when our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing slow or negative employment growth availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond the company’s control in addition various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation which could limit our ability to raise rents finally the federal government’s policies many of which may encourage home ownership can increase competition and possibly limit our ability to raise rents consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 

 

new acquisitions andor development projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

 

we intend to actively acquire andor develop multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues andor lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property additionally we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts this competition or lack thereof may 

increase or depress prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms the total number of development units costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

 

in connection with such government regulation we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance 

 

risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

 

we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures joint venture investments involve risks including the possibility that our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business or economic goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest further the company’s joint venture partners may experience financial distress and to the extent they do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures with them we may be adversely affected 

 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

 

the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company 

 

from time to time the company holds investment securities andor cash investments that have a higher risk profile than the government obligations and bond funds money market funds or bank deposits in which we generally invest on occasion we may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank exceeds the fdic insurance limit resulting in risk to the company of loss of funds if these banks fail 

 

changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

 

the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including but not limited to the following 

 

 9 

 

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

 

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders 

 

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer employment development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price 

 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price 

 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

 

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

 

there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate as some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted by excluding moldrelated claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property should mold become an issue in the future our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

 

climate change 

 

to the extent that climate change does occur we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

insurance policy deductibles exclusions and counterparties 

 

as of december 31 2010 the company’s property insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate selfinsured retention of 75 million with approximately 80 of any excess losses being covered by insurance any earthquake and named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of 5 of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate selfinsured retention the company’s general liability and worker’s compensation policies at december 31 2010 provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses but management has reviewed its claims history over the years and believes the savings in insurance premium expense justify this potential increased exposure over the longterm however the potential impact of climate change and increased severe weather could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles particularly for our coastal properties or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

 

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 property insurance carriers created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” property insurance policies as of december 31 2010 the company was insured for 5000 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio becoming more concentrated in fewer more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint 

 

in addition the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability and worker’s compensation insurance while there has yet to be any nonperformance by these major insurance providers should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact the company 

 

nonperformance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

 

we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties as a result defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided or volatility in the financial markets could affect counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

debt financing and preferred shares could adversely affect our performance 

 

general 

 

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31 2010 

 

in addition to debt we have 2000 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest with a weighted average dividend preference of 693 per annum as of december 31 2010 our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions 

 

dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in 

the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate significantly andor to decline 

 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance 

 

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac should fannie mae and freddie mac have their mandates changed or reduced be disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue providing liquidity to our sector it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital andor increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets andor the values realized upon sale disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit market’s perception of fannie mae and freddie mac which guarantee and provide liquidity for these bonds have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if fannie mae or freddie mac fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets 

 

nonperformance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

 

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress one of the financial institutions with a commitment of 750 million declared bankruptcy in 2008 and will not honor its financial commitment our borrowing capacity under the credit facility has in essence been permanently reduced to 1425 billion 

 

the company also has developed assets with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties 

 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the facility and impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders’ requirements at the lower rating level 

 

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

 

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2010 

 

financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition 

 

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facilities and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 should it fall out of compliance it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions we have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case 

 

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

 

our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 384 as of december 31 2010 in addition our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows 

 

 

 

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

 

advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders 

 

derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow 

 

in the normal course of business we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments including hedging for future debt issuances at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact these arrangements which can include a number of counterparties may expose us to additional risks including failure of any of our counterparties to 

perform under these contracts and may involve extensive costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 

 

we depend on our key personnel 

 

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer “ceo” if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 

 

control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other shareholders 

 

the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the sixth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company although to the company’s knowledge these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company’s affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees including mr zell and our executive officers see the company’s definitive proxy statement 

 

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

 

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

 

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below while our existing preferred shares do not have these provisions any future series of preferred shares may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

 

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

 

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device the company’s ownership limit requires rather than permits the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit 

 

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

 

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

 

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

 

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

 

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status in addition congress and the irs have recently liberalized the reit qualification rules to permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status 

 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition our corporate housing business which is conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries generally will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they have taxable income 

 

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

 

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger 

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

 

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

 

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company 

 

during 2008 and 2009 we did make and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the reit tax code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

 

federal income tax considerations 

 

general 

 

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flowthrough entity for federal income tax purposes 

 

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

 

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

 

our taxation 

 

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by our taxable reit subsidiaries 

 

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be 

subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

 

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

 

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

 

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a “taxable reit subsidiary” or “trs” provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 25 of the reit’s total asset value trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

 

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

 

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 

 

  

to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

 

asset tests  in general at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets 

 

  

the 10 value test described in clause 3 b above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of 14 of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer’s debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the 

reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

 

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

 

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

 

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

 

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

 

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders for tax years ending on or before december 31 2012 these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions 

cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

 

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit’s earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

 

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

 

generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15 rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution a 15 rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15 which 15 rate is currently scheduled to increase to 20 for taxable years beginning on and after january 1 2013 an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

 

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

 

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

 

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

 

  

  

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

 

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

 

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

 

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

 

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

 

taxation of foreign shareholders 

 

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

 

  

  

  

distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

 

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

 

  

  

if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

 

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

 

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report such distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as 

dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

 

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

 

  

  

under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability 

 

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition if timely requested foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

 

foreign shareholders’ sales of common shares  gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

 

  

  

even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

 

  

 22 

 

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

 

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

 

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service 

 

medicare tax on unearned income 

 

newly enacted legislation requires certain us shareholders that are taxed as individuals estates or trusts to pay an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares for taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 

 

withholding on foreign financial institutions and nonus shareholders 

 

newly enacted legislation may impose withholding taxes on certain types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions” and certain other nonus shareholders under this legislation the failure to comply with additional certification information reporting and other specified requirements could result in withholding tax being imposed on payments of dividends and sales proceeds to us shareholders that own their shares through foreign accounts or foreign intermediaries and certain nonus shareholders the legislation imposes a 30 withholding tax on dividends on and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our shares paid to a foreign financial institution or to a foreign nonfinancial entity unless i the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or ii the foreign nonfinancial entity either certifies it does not have any substantial us owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial us owner in addition if the payee is a foreign financial institution it generally must enter into an agreement with the us treasury that requires among other things that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain us persons or usowned foreign entities annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold 30 on payments to certain other account holders the legislation applies to payments made after december 31 2012

business objectives and operating and investing strategies 

 

the company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 

 

our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders revenue is maximized by driving qualified 

resident prospects to our properties converting this traffic costeffectively into new leases at the highest rent possible keeping our residents satisfied and renewing their leases at yet higher rents while we believe that it is our highquality welllocated assets that bring our customers to us it is our customer service that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 

 

we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged many of our residents utilize our webbased resident portal which allows them to review their account and make payments provide feedback and make service requests online 

 

we seek to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature one or more of the following 

 

  

acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt securities sales of properties joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales eqr may also acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure proceedings the company has also in the past converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business 

 

the company primarily sources the funds for its new property acquisitions in its core markets with the sales proceeds from selling assets that are older or located in noncore markets during the last five years the company has sold over 97000 apartment units for an aggregate sales price of 72 billion and acquired nearly 25000 apartment units in its core markets for approximately 55 billion we are currently acquiring and developing assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas boston new york washington dc south florida southern california san francisco seattle and to a lesser extent denver we also have investments in the aggregate about 18 of our noi in other markets including atlanta phoenix portland oregon new england excluding boston tampa orlando and jacksonville but do not intend to acquire or develop assets in these markets 

 

as part of its strategy the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties partially completed or partially unoccupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed we intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets currently no single metropolitan area accounts for more than 17 of our noi though no guarantee can be made that noi concentration may not increase in the future 

 

we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education resources and opportunities to succeed we provide many classroom and online training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the equipment and appliances on our property sites we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions we monitor our employees’ engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores 

 

we have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities with its high density multifamily housing is by its nature an environmentally friendly property type our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrianfriendly urban locations near public transportation when developing and renovating our properties we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets we continue to implement a combination of irrigation lighting and hvac improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption 

 

current environment 

 

through much of 2009 the company assumed a highly cautious outlook given uncertainty in the general economy and the capital markets and expected reduction in our property operations in late 2009 the company saw that occupancy was 

firming this was an especially encouraging sign as it came during the company’s seasonally slower fourth quarter at the same time the company also saw marked improvement in the capital markets in response the company began acquiring assets and increasing rents for both new and renewing residents which led to better operating and investment performance for the company 2010 was characterized by higher occupancy and rent levels than 2009 the company increased rents to a greater extent in markets like the northeast where the economy was stronger and multifamily operating conditions were better in 2010 the company ceased to hold the large cash balances often 10 billion or more that it held in 2009 in anticipation of debt maturities in an unsure capital markets climate this had the result of increasing the company’s earnings by decreasing debt prefunding costs finally the company was aggressive in acquiring 15 billion of assets in its target markets in 2010 improvement materialized throughout 2010 and as we enter 2011 we expect strong growth in same store revenue anticipated increases ranging from 40 to 50 and noi anticipated increases ranging from 50 to 75 and are optimistic that the improvement realized in 2010 will be sustained for the foreseeable future 

 

we currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets in july 2010 the company completed a 6000 million unsecured ten year notes offering with a coupon of 475 and an allin effective interest rate of 509 the allin rate combined with its accretive nature compared to maturing 2011 fixed rate debt led the company to pursue this transaction the company also raised 2919 million in equity under its atm common share offering program in 2010 and has raised an additional 1545 million under this program thus far in 2011 

 

given the strong market for many of our disposition assets and increased competition for assets in our target markets we expect to be a net seller of assets in 2011 in contrast to being a net buyer of assets in 2010 the company acquired 16 consolidated properties consisting of 4445 apartment units for 15 billion and six land parcels for 689 million during the year ended december 31 2010 while competition for the properties we were interested in acquiring increased as 2010 progressed due to the overall improvement in market fundamentals we were able to close several of what we believe are longterm value added acquisition opportunities our acquisition pipeline has moderated and we expect a greater concentration of our 2011 acquisitions to occur in the latter half of the year we believe our access to capital our ability to execute large complex transactions and our ability to efficiently stabilize large scale lease up properties provide us with a competitive advantage during the year ended december 31 2010 the company sold 35 consolidated properties consisting of 7171 apartment units for 7184 million and 27 unconsolidated properties consisting of 6275 apartment units generating cash proceeds to the company of 269 million as well as 2 condominium units for 04 million and one land parcel for 40 million we expect to continue strategic dispositions and see an increase in dispositions in 2011 as we believe there is currently a robust market and favorable pricing for certain of our nonstrategic assets our dispositions in 2010 were at higher capitalization “cap” rates see definition in results of operations than the acquisitions we completed we expect this to continue in 2011 and expect to experience dilution from past and future transactions 

 

we believe that cash and cash equivalents securities readily convertible to cash current availability on our revolving credit facility and disposition proceeds for 2011 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions debt maturities and existing development projects through 2011 we expect that our remaining longerterm funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings equity issuances including the company’s atm share offering program property dispositions joint ventures and cash generated from operations there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac any changes to their mandates could have a significant impact on the company and may among other things lead to lower values for our disposition assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings such changes may also provide an advantage to us by making the cost of financing single family home ownership more expensive and provide us a competitive advantage given the size of our balance sheet and the multiple sources of capital to which we have access 

 

we believe that the company is wellpositioned as of december 31 2010 our properties are geographically diverse and were approximately 941 occupied 945 on a same store basis little new multifamily rental supply will be added to most of our markets over the next several years and the longterm demographic picture is positive we believe our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt maturities and development fundings in the near term and should also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future as economic conditions continue to improve the shortterm nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed should allow us to realize revenue growth and improvement in our operating results 

 

the company anticipates that 2011 same store expenses will only increase 10 to 20 primarily due to modest increases in payroll expenses real estate tax rates and utility cost growth same store expenses increased 09 for 2010 when compared with the same period in the prior year this follows three consecutive years of excellent expense control same store expenses declined 01 between 2009 and 2008 and grew 22 between 2008 and 2007 and 21 between 2007 and 2006 

 

the current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

results of operations 

 

in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy the company continued to invest in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 in summary we 

 

year ended december 31 2010 

 

  

year ended december 31 2009 

 

  

the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment communities the cap rate is generally the first year noi yield net of replacements on the company’s investment 

 

properties that the company owned for all of both 2010 and 2009 the “2010 same store properties” which represented 112042 apartment units impacted the company’s results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2009 and 2008 the “2009 same store properties” which represented 113598 apartment units also impacted the company’s results of operations both the 2010 same store properties and 2009 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

 

the company’s acquisition disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 dilution as a result of the company’s net asset sales in 2009 partially offset by net asset acquisitions and lease up activity in 2010 negatively impacts property net operating income the impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs 

 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2010 to the year ended december 31 2009 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 the company reported diluted earnings per share of 095 compared to 127 per share for the year ended december 31 2009 the difference is primarily due to 373 million in lower gains from property sales in 2010 vs 2009 and 343 million in higher impairment losses in 2010 vs 2009 

for the year ended december 31 2010 loss from continuing operations increased approximately 228 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the decrease in continuing operations is discussed below 

 

revenues from the 2010 same store properties decreased 21 million primarily as a result of a decrease in average rental rates charged to residents partially offset by an increase in occupancy expenses from the 2010 same store properties increased 62 million primarily due to increases in repairs and maintenance expenses mostly due to greater stormrelated costs such as snow removal and roof repairs incurred during the first quarter of 2010 higher property management costs and increases in utility costs partially offset by lower real estate taxes and leasing and advertising expenses the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2010 same store properties

the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to noi for the 2010 same store properties 

 

 

 

for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1 2010 and expects to continue to own through december 31 2011 the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2011 

 

 

 

the company anticipates consolidated rental acquisitions of 10 billion and consolidated rental dispositions of 125 billion and expects that acquisitions will have a 125 lower cap rate than dispositions for the full year ending december 31 2011 

 

these 2011 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

 

nonsame store operating results increased approximately 846 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2009 and 2010 as well as operations from the company’s completed development properties and corporate housing business while the operations of the nonsame store assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended december 31 2010 similar to the same store assets the nonsame store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total noi to the company’s overall operating results primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in leaseup and a longer ownership period in 2010 than 2009 this increase primarily resulted from 

 

  

see also note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s segment disclosures 

 

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased approximately 15 million or 534 primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the company’s military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base as well as a decrease in asset management expenses partially offset by the unwinding of the company’s institutional joint ventures during 2010 see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased approximately 92 million or 128 this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payrollrelated costs due primarily to higher health insurance and bonus costs acceleration of longterm compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and the creation of the company’s central business group which moved administrative functions offsite legal and professional fees educationconference expenses real estate tax consulting fees and travel expenses 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 974 million or 174 primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2009 and 2010 development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned 

 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 09 million or 23 primarily due to higher overall payrollrelated costs due primarily to higher bonus costs partially offset by lower tax compliance fees and office rents the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 400 million to 420 million for the year ending december 31 2011 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

 

impairment from continuing operations increased approximately 343 million due to a 454 million impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter of 2010 on land held for development related to two potential development projects compared to an 111 million impairment charge taken during 2009 on land held for development see note 20 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately 111 million or 670 primarily as a result of a decrease in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment securities due to lower interest rates during the year ended december 31 2010 and lower overall balances as well as gains on debt extinguishment and the sale of investment securities recognized during the year ended december 31 2009 that did not reoccur in 2010 partially offset by an increase in insurancelitigation settlement proceeds the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate 20 million to 30 million for the year ending december 31 2011 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

 

other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately 54 million or 839 primarily due to an increase in the expensing of overhead pursuit cost writeoffs as a result of the company’s decision to reduce its development activities in prior periods as well as an increase in property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the company’s significantly higher acquisition volume in 2010 

 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 278 million or 55 primarily as a result of lower overall debt balances and higher debt extinguishment costs due to the significant debt repurchases in 2009 and lower rates in 2010 partially offset by interest expense on the 5000 million mortgage pool that closed in 2009 the 6000 million of unsecured notes that closed in july 2010 and lower capitalized interest during the year ended december 31 2010 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 130 million as compared to 349 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2010 was 514 as compared to 562 for the year ended december 31 2009 the company anticipates that interest expense excluding debt extinguishment costs and convertible debt discounts will approximate 4700 million to 4800 million for the year ending december 31 2011 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

 

income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately 25 million or 881 primarily due to a decrease in franchise taxes for texas and a decrease in business taxes for washington dc the company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate 05 million to 15 million for the year ending december 31 2011 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

 

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 21 million or 739 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the company’s 18 million share of defeasance costs incurred in conjunction with the extinguishment of crosscollateralized mortgage debt on one of the company’s partially owned unconsolidated joint ventures taken during the year ended december 31 2009 that did not reoccur in 2010 

 

net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately 174 million primarily due to larger gains on sale and revaluation of seven previously unconsolidated properties that were acquired from the company’s joint venture partner and the gain on sale for 27 properties sold during the year ended december 31 2010 compared with unconsolidated properties sold in the same period in 2009 

 

net loss on sales of land parcels increased approximately 14 million primarily due to the loss on sale of one land parcel during the year ended december 31 2010 

 

discontinued operations net decreased approximately 633 million or 167 between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily due to lower gains from property sales during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 and the operations of those properties in addition properties sold in 2010 reflect operations for none of or a 

partial period in 2010 in contrast to a full or partial period in 2009 see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

the company generally expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility under normal operating conditions the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions however there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature the company’s financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels the company reduced its quarterly common share dividend beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009 from 04825 per share to 03375 per share 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 the company announced a new dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts more closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the company’s core business and provide transparency to investors the company intends to pay an annual cash dividend equal to approximately 65 of normalized ffo during the year ended december 31 2010 the company paid 03375 per share for each of the first three quarters and 04575 per share for the fourth quarter to bring the total payment for the year an annual rate of 147 per share to approximately 65 of normalized ffo the company anticipates the expected dividend payout will be 156 to 162 per share 03375 per share for each of the first three quarters with the balance for the fourth quarter for the year ending december 31 2011 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking while the new dividend policy makes it less likely that the company will over distribute it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than in the past should operating results deteriorate the company believes that its expected 2011 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions 

the company also expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities including additional op units and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties as well as joint ventures in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit of the 197 billion in investment in real estate on the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2010 126 billion or 639 was unencumbered however there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise

the operating partnership has a 1425 billion net of 750 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and is not available for borrowing longterm revolving credit facility with available borrowings as of february 16 2011 of 134 billion net of 838 million which was restricteddedicated to support letters of credit and net of the 750 million discussed above that matures in february 2012 see note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion this facility may among other potential uses be used to fund property acquisitions costs for certain properties under development and shortterm liquidity requirements 

 

on july 16 2010 a portion of the parking garage collapsed at one of the company’s rental properties prospect towers in hackensack new jersey the company estimates that the costs related to such collapse both expensed and capitalized including providing for residents’ interim needs lost revenue and garage reconstruction will be approximately 120 million after insurance reimbursements of 80 million costs to rebuild the garage will be capitalized as incurred other costs like those to accommodate displaced residents lost revenue due to a portion of the property being temporarily unavailable for occupancy and legal costs will reduce earnings as they are incurred generally insurance proceeds will be recorded as increases to earnings as they are received an impairment charge of 13 million was recognized to writeoff the net book value of the collapsed garage during the year ended december 31 2010 the company received approximately 40 million in insurance proceeds which fully offset the impairment charge and partially offset expenses of 55 million that were recorded relating to this loss and are included in real estate taxes and insurance on the consolidated statements of operations in addition the company estimates that its lost revenues approximated 16 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as a result of the highrise tower being unoccupied following the garage collapse

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate 

 

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories 

 

  

  

all replacements are depreciated over a fiveyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 

 

  

 46 

 

 

  

all building improvements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1382 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 

 

capital expenditures to real estate for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

 

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2009 our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1239 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts 

 

capital expenditures to real estate for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

 

 47 

 

for 2011 the company estimates that it will spend approximately 1200 per apartment unit of capital expenditures for its same store properties inclusive of unit renovationrehab costs or 850 per apartment unit excluding unit renovationrehab costs for 2011 the company estimates that it will spend 410 million rehabbing 5500 apartment units equating to about 7500 per apartment unit rehabbed the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

 

during the year ended december 31 2010 the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 30 million the company expects to fund approximately 85 million in total additions to nonreal estate property in 2011 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

 

improvements to real estate and additions to nonreal estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow 

 

derivative instruments 

 

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 

 

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place 

 

see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31 2010 

 

other 

 

total distributions paid in january 2011 amounted to 1413 million excluding distributions on partially owned properties which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2010 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

 

the company had coinvested in various properties that were unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting management does not believe these investments had a materially different impact upon the company’s liquidity cash flows capital resources credit or market risk than its other property management and ownership activities during 2000 and 2001 the company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner at the respective closing dates the company sold andor contributed 45 properties containing 10846 apartment units to these ventures and retained a 25 ownership interest in the ventures the company’s joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75 of the agreedupon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures which was then distributed to the company the company’s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets as of december 31 2010 the company had sold its interest in these unconsolidated ventures with the exception of eight properties consisting of 2061 apartment units which were acquired by the company all of the related debt encumbering these ventures was extinguished 

 

as of december 31 2010 the company has four projects totaling 717 apartment units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through september 30 2012 as well as other completed development projects that are in various stages of lease up or are stabilized the development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in note 18 of the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

see also notes 2 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s investments in partially owned entities 

 

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements 

 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2010 and are consistent with the year ended december 31 2009 

 

the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the five critical accounting policies are 

 

acquisition of investment properties 

 

the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions and legal and environmental concerns as well as the company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

depreciation of investment in real estate 

 

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

 

cost capitalization 

 

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for a discussion of the company’s policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 

 

for all development projects the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as constructioninprogress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 

 

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

 

the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 

 

funds from operations and normalized funds from operations 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 funds from operations “ffo” available to common shares and units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units increased 73 million or 12 and 209 million or 32 respectively as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 for the year ended december 31 2009 ffo available to common shares and units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units decreased 29 million or 05 and 735 million or 100 respectively as compared to the year ended december 31 2008

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates and changes in the sifma index for taxexempt debt the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 

 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term credit facilities as well as floating rate taxexempt debt the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment to the extent the company carries substantial cash balances this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 

 

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

 

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets lines of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately 47 billion and 55 billion respectively at december 31 2010 

 

at december 31 2010 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 17 billion or 175 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 14 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 24 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 14 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 24 million 

 

at december 31 2010 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 82 billion or 825 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 57 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 75 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 57 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 91 billion 

 

at december 31 2010 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 233 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 12 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 98 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 12 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 370 million 

 

at december 31 2009 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 18 billion or 197 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 13 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 24 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 13 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 24 million 

 

at december 31 2009 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 75 billion or 803 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 59 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 69 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 59 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 84 billion 

at december 31 2009 the company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 252 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 20 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 355 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 20 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 159 million 

 

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

 

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

credit facilities 

the operating partnership has a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on february 28 2012 with the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 5000 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments advances under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread currently 05 dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based on bids received from the lending group eqr has guaranteed the operating partnership’s credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility 

during the year ended december 31 2008 one of the providers of the operating partnership’s unsecured revolving credit facility declared bankruptcy under the existing terms of the credit facility the provider’s share is up to 750 million of potential borrowings as a result the operating partnership’s borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility has in essence been permanently reduced to 1425 billion of potential borrowings the obligation to fund by all of the other providers has not changed

competition 

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors for additional information with respect to competition

 item 1a risk factors tableend general 

the following risk factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “we” and “us” refer to equity residential and its subsidiaries including erp operating limited partnership this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” and limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” in this section we refer to the shares and the op units together as our “securities” and the investors who own shares andor op units as our “security holders” 

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 

general 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties these factors include changes in the national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other available multifamily property owners and single family homes and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes which could increase over time sources of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions 

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders however there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the 

  

difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

when our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration we may not be able to relet their units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms because virtually all of our leases are for apartments they are generally for terms of no more than one year if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing slow or negative employment growth availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond the company’s control in addition various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation which could limit our ability to raise rents finally the federal government is considering and may continue to consider policies which may encourage home ownership thus increasing competition and possibly limiting our ability to raise rents consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 

new acquisitions andor development projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

we intend to actively acquire multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate the company also develops projects and currently has several properties under development we may begin new development activities if conditions warrant we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property additionally we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms to the extent that we do develop more properties if conditions warrant we expect to do so ourselves in addition to coinvesting with our development partners the total number of development units costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

in connection with such government regulation we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities acts the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in fines subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company 

from time to time the company holds investment securities that have a higher risk profile than the government obligations and bond funds money market funds or bank deposits in which we generally invest on occasion we may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank exceeds the fdic insurance limit resulting in risk to the company of loss of funds if these banks fail 

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders 

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer employment development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

  

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate as some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted by excluding moldrelated claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

climate change 

to the extent that climate change does occur we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition developments in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

insurance policy deductibles and exclusions 

in order to manage insurance costs management has gradually increased deductible and selfinsured retention amounts as of december 31 2009 the company’s property insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate selfinsured retention of 75 million with approximately 80 of any excess losses being covered by insurance any earthquake and named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of 5 of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate selfinsured retention the company’s general liability and worker’s compensation policies at december 31 2009 provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses but management believes the savings in insurance premium expense justify this potential increased exposure over the longterm however the potential impact of climate change and increased severe weather could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles particularly for our coastal properties or a decrease in the availability of coverage either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 property insurance carriers created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” property insurance policies as of december 31 2009 the company was 

  

insured for 5000 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company believes however that the number of properties in and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its terrorism insurance coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks 

debt financing and preferred shares could adversely affect our performance 

general 

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31 2009 

in addition to debt we have 2088 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest with a weighted average dividend preference of 694 per annum as of december 31 2009 our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions 

dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us andor the unavailability of certain types of debt financing should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited or be available only on unattractive terms we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit market’s perception of fannie mae and freddie mac which guarantee and provide liquidity for these bonds have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if fannie mae or freddie mac fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets furthermore while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital andor increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate significantly andor to decline 

nonperformance by our counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance disruptions in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress one of the financial institutions with a commitment of 750 million declared bankruptcy in 2008 and it is unlikely that they will honor their financial commitment our borrowing capacity under the credit facility has in essence been permanently reduced to 1425 billion 

the company also has several assets under development with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties further the company’s joint venture partners may experience financial distress and to the extent they do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures with them we may be adversely affected in addition the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property general liability and worker’s compensation insurance while there has yet to be any nonperformance by these major 

  

insurance providers should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress it could negatively impact the company 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the facility and impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt by increasing borrowing costs or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles 

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property 

if a property we own is mortgaged to secure debt and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property resulting in loss of income and asset value foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2009 

financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition 

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facilities and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions we have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited generally we believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions 

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 481 as of december 31 2009 our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general 

  

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders 

derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow 

in the normal course of business we use derivatives to hedge our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments including hedging for future debt issuances there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact these arrangements which can include a number of counterparties may expose us to additional risks including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts and may involve extensive costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 

we depend on our key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer “ceo” if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 

control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other shareholders 

the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the sixth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company although to the company’s knowledge these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company’s affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees including mr zell and our executive officers see the company’s definitive proxy statement 

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below while our existing preferred shares do not have these provisions any future series of preferred shares may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders in 2008 we adopted amendments to our bylaws to expand the information required to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these amendments could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding 

  

class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device in 2004 the company amended the ownership limit to require rather than permit the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit 

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status in addition congress and the irs have recently liberalized the reit qualification rules to permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in 

  

addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition our corporate housing business and condominium conversion business which are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries generally will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they have taxable income 

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger 

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company 

during 2008 and 2009 we did make and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the reit tax code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

federal income tax considerations 

general 

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flowthrough entity for federal income tax purposes 

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative 

  

interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

our taxation 

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by our taxable reit subsidiaries 

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of “taxable reit subsidiaries” or “trss” which are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not 

  

comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 

 

  

 to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

asset tests  in general at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets 

 

  

  

   

  

 the 10 value test described in clause 3 b above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of 1  4 of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer’s debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

  

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders and are currently for the 2010 tax year eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit’s earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15 rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution a 15 rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15 which 15 rate is currently scheduled to increase to 20 for taxable years beginning on and after january 1 2011 an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital 

  

gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

 

  

 the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

taxation of foreign shareholders 

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

 

  

  

 distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with 

  

a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

 

  

 if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report such distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

 

  

 under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability 

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign 

  

shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition if timely requested foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

foreign shareholders’ sales of common shares  gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

 

  

 even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

 

  

 if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service

the company seeks to maximize current income capital appreciation of each property and the total return for its shareholders the company’s strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

acquisition development and disposition strategies 

the company anticipates that future property acquisitions developments and dispositions will occur within the united states acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt securities sales of properties joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales eqr may also acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities 

when evaluating potential acquisitions developments and dispositions the company generally considers the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition development and rehab strategies and at times to fund its debt maturities and debt and equity repurchase activities in addition when feasible the company may structure these transactions as taxdeferred exchanges 

current environment 

the slowdown in the economy which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued into 2009 coupled with continued job losses andor lack of job growth leads us to be cautious regarding expected performance for 2010 since the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2009 our revenue has declined in comparison to the prior year in most of our major markets as the economic slowdown continues to impact existing and prospective residents markets with little employment loss have performed better than markets with larger employment issues although all of our markets experienced job losses in 2009 the pace of those losses appears to have begun to slow while the job market is likely to remain weak in 2010 beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2009 household spending was reported to have increased and the deterioration in the labor market showed signs of abating despite a generally improving credit environment and better general economic conditions the company may continue to experience a period of declining revenues which would adversely impact the company’s results of operations the vast majority of our leases are for terms of 12 months or less as a result we quickly feel the impact of an economic downturn which limits our ability to raise rents or causes us to lower rents on turnover units and lease renewals during late 2008 and early 2009 our rental rates declined on average between 9 and 10 for new residents but on average less than 1 for renewing residents rental rates have not declined on average since the first quarter of 2009 and began to show improvement in the latter part of the year however since our rental rates increased during most of 2008 our quarter over quarter revenue declines worsened each quarter in 2009 as compared to 2008 quarter over quarter revenue declines are expected to continue in 2010 although they should be less negative in 2010 vs 2009 than when comparing 2009 vs 2008 given the rolldown in lease rates that occurred throughout 2009 the full year comparison to 2010 will continue to show declining revenue even if quarter over quarter revenue improvement begins 

  

in the second half of 2010 our revenues are also impacted by our resident turnover rates which have generally declined and our occupancy rates which began to rise in the fourth quarter of 2009 after three consecutive years of excellent expense control same store expenses declined 01 between 2009 and 2008 and grew 22 between 2008 and 2007 and 21 between 2007 and 2006 the company anticipates that 2010 same store expenses will increase between 10 and 20 primarily due to cost pressures from noncontrollable areas such as real estate taxes and utilities the combination of expected declines in revenues and moderately increasing expense levels will have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations for 2010 

the strained credit environment has negatively impacted the availability and pricing of debt capital however during this time the multifamily residential sector has benefited from the continued liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac a vast majority of the properties we sold in 2008 and 2009 were financed for the purchaser by one of these agencies furthermore fannie mae and freddie mac provided us with approximately 16 billion of secured mortgage financing in 2008 and 5000 million in 2009 at attractive rates when compared to other sources of credit at that time while unsecured credit markets improved in the latter part of 2009 and the company currently has unsecured lending options available to it at attractive rates should the agencies discontinue providing liquidity to our sector have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital andor increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets 

in response to the recession and liquidity issues prevalent in the debt markets we took a number of steps to better position ourselves in early 2008 we began prefunding our maturing debt obligations with approximately 16 billion in secured mortgage financing obtained from fannie mae and freddie mac we also significantly reduced our acquisition activity during the second half of 2008 and through the fourth quarter of 2009 we only acquired four properties one of which was the buyout of our partner in an unconsolidated asset and a longterm leasehold interest in a land parcel while we continued selling noncore assets during the year ended december 31 2009 the company sold 60 properties consisting of 12489 units for 10 billion as well as 62 condominium units for 120 million the company acquired two properties consisting of 566 units for 1450 million one previously unconsolidated property consisting of 250 units for 185 million from its institutional joint venture partner and a longterm leasehold interest in a land parcel for 115 million during the year ended december 31 2009 while we believe these sales of noncore assets better positions us for future success they have resulted and will continue to result in dilution particularly when the net sales proceeds are initially not reinvested in activities generating equivalent income such as acquisition of rental properties or repayment of debt additionally we have significantly reduced our development activities starting only two new projects in the first half of 2008 and none in the second half of the year or during 2009 we also reduced the number of planned development projects we will undertake in the future and took a 1164 million impairment charge in 2008 to reduce the value of five assets that we no longer plan on pursuing we took an additional 111 million impairment charge in 2009 to reduce the value of one asset the company reduced its quarterly common share dividend beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009 from 04825 per share an annual rate of 193 per share to 03375 per share an annual rate of 135 per share 

the credit environment improved throughout mid and late 2009 and we currently have access to multiple sources of capital allowing us a less cautious posture with respect to prefunding our maturing debt obligations as a result of the improved credit environment in late 2009 we utilized 3662 million of cash on hand to repurchase certain unsecured notes and convertible notes in public tender offers concurrently beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009 we began to see an increase in the availability of attractive acquisition opportunities we expect to revert from a net seller of assets during 2009 to a net buyer of assets in 2010 during 2010 we expect that property dispositions will be more a funding source for attractive acquisition opportunities that we may identify than for providing needed capital to protect the company’s financial position our access to capital and our ability to execute large complex transactions should be competitive advantages in 2010 however should a doubledip recession materialize or creditequity markets deteriorate we may seek to take steps similar to what we did in 2008 and early 2009 to increase liquidity and better position ourselves 

our specific current expectations regarding our results for 2010 and certain items that will affect them are set forth under results of operations below 

we believe that cash and cash equivalents securities readily convertible to cash current availability on our revolving credit facility and disposition proceeds for 2010 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions debt retirement and existing development projects through 2010 we expect that our remaining longerterm funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings equity issuances including the company’s atm share offering program property dispositions and cash generated from operations 

  

despite the challenging conditions noted above we believe that the company is wellpositioned notwithstanding the slow economic recovery our properties are geographically diverse and were approximately 94 occupied as of december 31 2009 little new multifamily rental supply has been added to most of our markets and the longterm demographic picture is positive 

we believe we are wellpositioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover debt maturities and development fundings in the near term which should allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future when economic conditions improve the shortterm nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed should allow us to quickly realize revenue growth and improvement in our operating results

 the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment communities 

properties that the company owned for all of both 2009 and 2008 the “2009 same store properties” which represented 113598 units impacted the company’s results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2008 and 2007 the “2008 same store properties” which represented 115051 units also impacted the company’s results of operations both the 2009 same store properties and 2008 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

the company’s acquisition disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 dilution as a result of the company’s net asset sales negatively impacts property net operating income the impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2009 to the year ended december 31 2008 

for the year ended december 31 2009 the company reported diluted earnings per share of 127 compared to 146 per share for the year ended december 31 2008 the difference is primarily due to the following 

  

  

  

 for the year ended december 31 2009 income from continuing operations increased approximately 409 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in continuing operations is discussed below 

revenues from the 2009 same store properties decreased 524 million primarily as a result of a decrease in average rental rates charged to residents and a decrease in occupancy expenses from the 2009 same store properties decreased 08 million primarily due to lower property management costs partially offset by higher real estate taxes and utility costs the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2009 same store properties

 these 2010 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

nonsame store operating results increased approximately 343 million or 794 and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2008 and 2009 as well as operations from the company’s completed development properties and corporate housing business while the operations of the nonsame store assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended december 31 2009 similar to the same store assets the nonsame store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total noi to the company’s overall operating results primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in leaseup and a longer ownership period in 2009 than 2008 this increase primarily resulted from

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased approximately 01 million or 34 primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the company’s military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base as well as a decrease in asset management expenses as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the company managed 12681 units and 14485 units respectively primarily for unconsolidated entities and its military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses decreased approximately 51 million or 67 this decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall payrollrelated costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the company’s portfolio as well as 

  

decreases in temporary helpcontractors telecommunications and travel expenses

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses decreased approximately 60 million or 133 primarily due to lower overall payrollrelated costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the company’s portfolio as well as a 29 million decrease in severance related costs in 2009 and a decrease in tax consulting costs the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 380 million to 400 million for the year ending december 31 2010 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

impairment from continuing operations decreased approximately 1053 million due to an 111 million impairment charge taken during 2009 on a land parcel held for development compared to a 1164 million impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 on land held for development related to five potential development projects that are no longer being pursued see note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately 168 million or 502 primarily as a result of an 187 million gain recognized during 2008 related to the partial debt extinguishment of the company’s notes compared to a 45 million gain recognized in 2009 see note 9 in addition interest earned on cash and cash equivalents decreased due to a decrease in interest rates and because the company received less insurancelitigation settlement proceeds and forfeited deposits in 2009 partially offset by a 49 million gain on the sale of investment securities realized in 2009 the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate 10 million to 30 million for the year ending december 31 2010 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately 07 million or 126 primarily due to an increase in transaction costs incurred in conjunction with the company’s acquisition of two properties consisting of 566 units from unaffiliated parties as well as expensing transaction costs associated with the company’s acquisition of all of its partners’ interests in five previously partially owned properties consisting of 1587 units in 2009 this was partially offset by a decrease in pursuit cost writeoffs as a result of the company’s decision to significantly reduce its development activities in 2009 the company anticipates that other expenses will approximate 90 million to 120 million for the year ending december 31 2010 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 174 million or 35 primarily as a result of an increase in debt extinguishment costs and lower capitalized interest during the year ended december 31 2009 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 349 million as compared to 601 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2009 was 562 as compared to 556 for the year ended december 31 2008 the company anticipates that interest expense will approximate 4660 million to 4760 million for the year ending december 31 2010 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately 27 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the company’s 18 million share of defeasance costs incurred in conjunction with the extinguishment of crosscollateralized mortgage debt on one of the company’s partially owned unconsolidated joint ventures as well as a decline in the operating performance of these properties

net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately 30 million due to the sale of vacant land located in florida during the year ended december 31 2008 versus no land sales in 2009 

discontinued operations net decreased approximately 952 million or 212 between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily due to lower gains from property sales during the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 and the operations of those properties in addition properties sold in 2009 reflect operations for a partial period in 2009 in contrast to a full period in 2008 see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate 

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 all replacements are depreciated over a fiveyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 all building improvements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset 

  

for the year ended december 31 2009 our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1239 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts 

capital expenditures to real estate 

for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

  

     for the year ended december 31 2008 our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1698 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts 

capital expenditures to real estate 

for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

  

    the company incurred less in capital expenditures in 2009 primarily due to continued efforts to limit the scope of projects and greater cost controls on vendors for 2010 the company estimates that it will spend approximately 1075 per unit of capital expenditures for its same store properties inclusive of unit renovationrehab costs or 825 per unit excluding unit renovationrehab costs the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

during the year ended december 31 2009 the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 20 million the company expects to fund approximately 16 million in total additions to nonreal estate property in 2010 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

  

improvements to real estate and additions to nonreal estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow 

derivative instruments 

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company seeks to limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place 

see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31 2009 

other 

total distributions paid in january 2010 amounted to 1007 million excluding distributions on partially owned properties which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2009 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

the company has coinvested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the company’s liquidity cash flows capital resources credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities during 2000 and 2001 the company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner at the respective closing dates the company sold andor contributed 45 properties containing 10846 units to these ventures and retained a 25 ownership interest in the ventures the company’s joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75 of the agreedupon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures which was then distributed to the company the company’s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets the company sold seven properties consisting of 1684 units including one property containing 250 units which was acquired by the company three properties consisting of 670 units and one property consisting of 400 units during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the company and its joint venture partner currently intend to wind up these investments over the next few years by selling the related assets which may involve refinancing the assets as a majority of the debt encumbering them matures in 2010 and early 2011 the company cannot estimate what if any profit it will receive from these dispositions or if the company will in fact receive its equity back 

as of december 31 2009 the company has four projects totaling 1700 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through june 30 2011 the development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in note 18 of the company’s consolidated financial statements

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of december 31 2009 

 

   

 

    critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2009 and are consistent with the year ended december 31 2008 except with respect to noncontrolling interests and convertible debt as further described in note 2 

the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the five critical accounting policies are 

acquisition of investment properties 

the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 

impairment of longlived assets 

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate for indicators of permanent impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions and legal and environmental concerns as well as the company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

depreciation of investment in real estate 

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

cost capitalization 

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for a discussion of the company’s policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 

  

for all development projects the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as constructioninprogress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired

the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates and changes in the sifma index for taxexempt debt the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term credit facilities as well as floating rate taxexempt debt the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment to the extent the company carries as it did at december 31 2008 substantial cash balances this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets lines of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately 46 billion and 47 billion respectively at december 31 2009 

at december 31 2009 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 18 billion or 197 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 13 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 24 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 13 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 24 million 

at december 31 2009 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 75 billion or 803 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 59 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 69 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 59 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 84 billion 

at december 31 2009 the company’s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 252 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 20 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 355 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 20 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 159 million 

at december 31 2008 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 19 billion or 183 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 34 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 65 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 34 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 65 million 

at december 31 2008 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 86 billion or 817 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 58 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 78 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 58 

  

basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 95 billion 

at december 31 2008 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 19000 if market rates of interest permanently increased by 15 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 17 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 15 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 18 million 

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

credit facilities 

the operating partnership has a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on february 28 2012 with the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 5000 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments advances under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based on bids received from the lending group eqr has guaranteed the operating partnership’s credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility 

during the year ended december 31 2008 one of the providers of the operating partnership’s unsecured revolving credit facility declared bankruptcy under the existing terms of the credit facility the provider’s share is up to 750 million of potential borrowings as a result the operating partnership’s borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility has in essence been permanently reduced to 1425 billion of potential borrowings the obligation to fund by all of the other providers has not changed 

on april 1 2005 the operating partnership obtained a threeyear 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on may 29 2008 advances under the credit facility bore interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based on bids received from the lending group eqr guaranteed the operating partnership’s credit facility up to the maximum

competition 

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and singlefamily housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors for additional information with respect to competition 

environmental considerations 

see item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

general 

the following risk factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “we” and “us” refer to equity residential and its subsidiaries including erp operating limited partnership this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements included in item 7 

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference interests andor units “interests” andor “units” of a subsidiary of erp operating limited partnership our operating partnership and limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” in this section we refer to the shares interests units and the op units together as our “securities” and the investors who own shares interests units andor op units as our “security holders” 

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 

general 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties these factors include changes in the national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other available multifamily property owners and single family homes and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes which could increase over time sources of labor and materials required for maintenance repair capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated also 

  

the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions 

we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders however there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions andor using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

when our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration we may not be able to relet their units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms because virtually all of our leases are for apartments they are generally for terms of no more than one year if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including without limitation new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing slow or negative employment growth availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability all of which are beyond the company’s control in addition various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation which could limit our ability to raise rents finally the federal government is considering and may continue to consider policies which may encourage home ownership thus increasing competition and possibly limiting our ability to raise rents consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 

new acquisitions andor development projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

we intend to actively acquire multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate the company does not currently intend to begin the development of any new whollyowned projects but has a substantial number of properties under development now and may commence new development activities if conditions warrant we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property additionally we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms to the extent that we do develop more properties if conditions warrant we expect to do so ourselves in addition to coinvesting with our development partners the total number of development units cost of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders similarly changes that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our securities 

  

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer employment development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies while these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate as some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted by excluding moldrelated claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

insurance policy deductibles and exclusions 

in order to manage insurance costs management has gradually increased deductible and selfinsured retention amounts as of december 31 2008 the company’s property insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate selfinsured retention of 75 million with approximately 80 of any excess losses being covered by insurance any earthquake and named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of 5 of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate selfinsured retention the company’s general liability and worker’s compensation policies at december 31 2008 provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses but management believes the savings in insurance premium expense justify this potential increased exposure over the longterm 

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 property insurance carriers created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” property insurance policies as of december 31 2008 the company was insured for 5000 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company believes however that the number of properties in and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its terrorism insurance coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks 

  

debt financing preferred shares and preference interests and units could adversely affect our performance 

general 

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31 2008 

in addition to debt we have 2090 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest and preference units with a weighted average dividend preference of 694 per annum as of december 31 2008 our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions 

the united states capital and credit markets continue to experience significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets making financing terms for us less attractive and resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing if the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited on unattractive terms or nonexistent we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions due to disruptions in the floating rate taxexempt bond market where the interest rates reset weekly and in the credit market’s perception of fannie mae and freddie mac which guaranty and provide liquidity for these bonds we have experienced and could experience in the future an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if fannie mae or freddie mac fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations while this obligation is in almost all cases nonrecourse to us this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets furthermore while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded by the government it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital andor increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate significantly andor to decline 

nonperformance by our counterparties could adversely affect our performance 

although we have not experienced any material counterparty nonperformance the disruption in financial and credit markets could among other things impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required our financial condition could be adversely affected should several of these institutions fail to fund we could experience significant financial distress 

one of the financial institutions with a commitment of 750 million has recently declared bankruptcy and it is unlikely that they would honor their financial commitment our borrowing capacity under the credit facility has in essence been permanently reduced to 1425 billion the company also has several assets under development with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that are suffering varying degrees of distress if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties in addition the parent of one of the company’s insurance providers has also experienced liquidity issues and while there has yet to be any nonperformance should any occur it could negatively impact the company should any of our other major insurance providers experience similar financial or other distress it could negatively impact the company finally we are also party to various derivative contracts with a number of counterparties any failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts could negatively impact us 

  

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 

a significant downgrade in our credit ratings while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the facility and also would impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt by increasing borrowing costs or otherwise limit our access to capital in addition a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral andor letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our selfinsured property and liability insurance deductibles 

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

we may not be able to refinance existing debt including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result certain of our other debt may cross default we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property 

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2008 

financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition 

if a property we own is mortgaged to secure debt and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property resulting in loss of income and asset value foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facilities and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions we have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited generally we believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions 

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 543 as of december 31 2008 our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general 

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based upon bids received from the 

  

lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders we use interest rate hedging arrangements to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility but these arrangements may expose us to additional risks and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact and may involve costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them 

we depend on our key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 

in the event the chairman of the board andor the ceo are unable to serve i the lead trustee will automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the chairman ii the chairman will automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the ceo and iii the chair of the compensation committee of the board will immediately call a meeting of the committee to recommend to the full board the selection of a permanent replacement for either or both positions as necessary 

control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other shareholders 

the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the fifth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company although these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company’s affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees including mr zell and our executive officers see the company’s definitive proxy statement 

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below while our existing preferred shares do not have these provisions any future series of preferred shares may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders in 2008 we adopted amendments to our bylaws to expand the information required to be provided by any security holder or persons acting in concert with such security holder who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities these amendments could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the 

  

ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device in 2004 the company amended the ownership limit to require rather than permit the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit 

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status in addition congress and the irs have recently liberalized the reit qualification rules to permit reit’s in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition our corporate housing business and condominium conversion business which are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they have taxable income 

  

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain in this event we could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger finally we could be precluded from electing reit status for up to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for reit status 

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company 

during 2008 we did make and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the reit tax code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

federal income tax considerations 

general 

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states 

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

  

our taxation 

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by our taxable reit subsidiaries 

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would not be able to reelect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of “taxable reit subsidiaries” or “trss” which are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed on reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

  

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to reduce if possible the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 

 

  to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

asset tests  in general at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets 

 

      

the 10 value test described in clause 3 b above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of 1  4 of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer’s debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would unless certain relief provisions applied fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

  

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders and are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit’s earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15 rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution a 15 rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15 an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

  

  

 the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

taxation of foreign shareholders 

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

 

  

  

 distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

  

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

 

  

 a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

 

  

 except as described above under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability 

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against the united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition foreign shareholders would be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

  

foreign shareholders’ sales of common shares  gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

 

  

 even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

 

  

 if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service

business objectives and operating strategies 

the company seeks to maximize current income capital appreciation of each property and the total return for its shareholders the company’s strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes 

 

  

     

  

    

  

 acquisition development and disposition strategies 

the company anticipates that future property acquisitions developments and dispositions will occur within the united states acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt securities sales of properties joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the 

  

acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales eqr may also acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities 

when evaluating potential acquisitions developments and dispositions the company generally considers the following factors 

 

               the company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition development and rehab strategies and at times to fund its debt and equity repurchase activities in addition when feasible the company may structure these transactions as taxdeferred exchanges 

current environment 

the slowdown in the economy which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2008 coupled with continued job losses andor lack of job growth leads us to be cautious regarding expected performance for 2009 since the fourth quarter of 2008 our revenue has declined in most of our major markets as the economic slowdown continues to impact existing and prospective residents markets with little employment loss should perform better than markets with employment issues although most of our markets are now experiencing job losses should the current credit crisis and general economic recession continue the company may continue to experience a period of declining revenues which would adversely impact the company’s results of operations the vast majority of our leases are for terms of 12 months or less as a result we quickly feel the impact of an economic downturn which limits our ability to raise rents or causes us to lower rents on turnover units and lease renewals since the second half of 2008 continued job losses and a lack of household formation have hampered our ability to increase rents or caused us to lower rents for new residents additionally in recent months it has become increasingly difficult to maintain rents with our renewing residents 

after two consecutive years of modest expense growth same store expenses grew 22 between 2008 and 2007 and 21 between 2007 and 2006 the company anticipates that 2009 expenses will increase at a higher rate primarily due to cost pressures from noncontrollable areas such as utilities and real estate taxes the combination of expected declines in revenues and higher overall expense levels will have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations for 2009 

the continued credit crisis has negatively impacted the availability and pricing of debt capital during this time the multifamily residential sector has benefited from the continued liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac a vast majority of the properties we sold this year were financed for the purchaser by one of these agencies furthermore fannie mae and freddie mac provided us with approximately 16 billion of secured mortgage financing in 2008 at attractive rates when compared to other sources of credit while the company believes these agencies will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded by the government it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital andor increase borrowing 

  

costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets 

in response to the recession and liquidity issues prevalent in the debt markets we took a number of steps to better position ourselves in early 2008 we began prefunding our maturing debt obligations with approximately 16 billion in secured mortgage financing obtained from fannie mae and freddie mac we also significantly reduced our acquisition activity during the second half of 2008 we only acquired one property while we continued selling noncore assets we expect to continue to be a net seller of assets during 2009 should current conditions continue additionally we significantly reduced our development activities starting only two new projects in the first half of 2008 and none in the second half of the year we also reduced the number of planned development projects we will undertake in the future and took a 1164 million impairment charge to reduce the value of five assets that we no longer plan on pursuing we do not currently anticipate starting any new whollyowned development projects during 2009 unless market conditions improve significantly finally during 2009 we also expect to continue our focus on our expense control initiatives 

our specific current expectations regarding our results for 2009 and certain items that will affect them are set forth under results of operations below 

we believe that cash and cash equivalents federally insured investment deposits and current availability on our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to debt retirement and existing development projects into 2011 we expect that our remaining funding obligations for 2011 and subsequent periods will be met through new borrowings property dispositions and cash generated from operations 

despite the challenging conditions noted above we believe that the company is wellpositioned to withstand the continuing economic downturn our properties are geographically diverse and were approximately 93 occupied as of december 31 2008 little new multifamily rental supply has been added to most of our markets the national single family home ownership rate continues to decline and the longterm demographic picture is positive 

we believe we are wellpositioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover debt maturities and development fundings in the near term which should allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities should distressed assets become available at significant discounts when economic conditions improve the shortterm nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed should allow us to quickly realize revenue growth and improvement in our operating results 

results of operations 

in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy the company continued to invest or recycle its capital investment in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 in summary we

 year ended december 31 2007 

 

  

 the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental 

  

measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment communities 

properties that the company owned for all of both 2008 and 2007 the “2008 same store properties” which represented 115051 units impacted the company’s results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2007 and 2006 the “2007 same store properties” which represented 115857 units also impacted the company’s results of operations both the 2008 same store properties and 2007 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

the company’s acquisition disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 the impacts of these activities are also discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2008 to the year ended december 31 2007 

for the year ended december 31 2008 income from continuing operations net of minority interests decreased by approximately 269 million or 397 when compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in continuing operations is discussed below 

revenues from the 2008 same store properties increased 538 million primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged to residents expenses from the 2008 same store properties increased 135 million primarily due to higher real estate taxes utility costs and payroll the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2008 same store properties

 for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1 2008 and expects to continue to own through december 31 2009 the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2009 

  

 these 2009 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

nonsame store operating results increased approximately 661 million or 798 and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2008 and 2007 as well as operations from completed development properties and our corporate housing business 

see also note 20 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s segment disclosures 

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased approximately 20 million primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on the management of our military housing venture at fort lewis along with the addition of mcchord air force base as well as a decrease in asset management expenses as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the company managed 14485 units and 14472 units respectively primarily for unconsolidated entities and our military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses decreased by approximately 104 million or 119 this decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall payrollrelated costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the company’s portfolio as well as a decrease in legal and professional fees 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased approximately 289 million or 51 primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2007 and 2008 and capital expenditures for all properties owned 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses decreased approximately 18 million or 39 primarily as a result of a 22 million decrease in profit sharing expense and lower overall payrollrelated costs partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees due to a 17 million expense recovery recorded for the year ended december 31 2007 related to a certain lawsuit in florida see note 21 the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 400 million to 420 million for the year ending december 31 2009 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

impairment from continuing operations increased approximately 1204 million primarily due to an impairment charge on land held for development of 1164 million taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to five potential development projects that will no longer be pursued in addition the company wroteoff an additional 40 million of various pursuit and outofpocket costs for terminated development transactions and halted condominium conversion properties during 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 see note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately 134 million or 665 primarily as a result of an 187 million gain recognized during the year ended december 31 2008 related to the partial debt extinguishment of the company’s june 2009 and august 2026 public notes see note 9 as well as an increase in shortterm investments this was partially offset by a 73 million decrease in interest earned on 1031 exchange and earnest money deposits due primarily to the decline in the company’s transaction activities the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate 90 million to 120 million for the year ending december 31 2009 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 41 million or 08 primarily as a result of lower overall effective interest rates and a reduction in debt extinguishment costs partially offset by higher overall debt levels outstanding due to the company’s 2007 share repurchase activity and its prefunding of its 2008 and 2009 debt maturities during the year ended december 31 2008 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 601 million as compared to 451 million for the year ended 

  

december 31 2007 this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2008 was 556 as compared to 596 for the year ended december 31 2007 the company anticipates that interest expense will approximate 4750 million to 4950 million for the year ending december 31 2009 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately 28 million primarily due to a change in the estimate for texas state taxes and an increase in franchise taxes the company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate 10 million to 20 million for the year ending december 31 2009 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately 04 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily due to income received in 2007 from the sale of the company’s 7075 ownership interest in wellsford park highlands corporation an entity which owns a condominium development in denver colorado 

net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately 02 million primarily due to a 29 million gain on the sale of three unconsolidated institutional joint venture properties realized in 2008 compared to a gain of 26 million realized in 2007 on the sale of one property 

net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately 34 million primarily as a result of higher net gains realized in 2007 on the sale of two land parcels compared to the net gain realized in 2008 on the sale of one land parcel 

discontinued operations net of minority interests decreased approximately 5426 million between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily due to a significant decrease in the number of properties sold during the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 as well as the mix of properties sold in each year see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2007 to the year ended december 31 2006 

for the year ended december 31 2007 income from continuing operations net of minority interests increased by approximately 375 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in continuing operations is discussed below

see also note 20 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s segment disclosures 

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased 06 million primarily as a result of an increase in property management fees from unconsolidated entities along with a decrease in asset management expenses from managing fewer properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the company managed 14472 units and 15020 units respectively primarily for unconsolidated entities and our military housing venture at fort lewis 

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses decreased by approximately 87 million or 90 this decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall payroll costs various reserve adjustments for workers compensation and medical costs and lower training costs associated with the completion of a majority of the rollout of a new property management system partially offset by higher legal and professional fees 

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased 796 million primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on newly acquired properties and capital expenditures for all properties owned 

general and administrative expenses from continuing operations which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 26 million between the periods under comparison this increase was primarily due to an increase in restricted share expense and severance costs associated with the resignation of two of the company’s executives as well as less expense recovery related to a certain lawsuit in florida see note 21 partially offset by a decrease in profit sharing 

impairment from continuing operations decreased 323 million primarily due to an impairment charge on goodwill of 300 million taken in 2006 related to the corporate housing business in addition in 2006 the company wroteoff 20 million of various deferred sales costs following the decision to halt the condominium conversion and sale process at five assets 

interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately 107 million primarily as a result of 147 million of forfeited deposits for various terminated transactions along with 37 million in proceeds from ebay’s acquisition of rentcom received during the year ended december 31 2006 this was partially offset by 41 million received in 2007 for insurance litigation settlement proceeds a 27 million increase in interest earned on 1031 exchange and earnest money deposits and a 07 million increase in interest earned on shortterm investments 

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 673 million primarily as a result of higher overall debt levels outstanding due to the company’s share repurchase activity as well as the timing of acquisitions and dispositions partially offset by lower overall effective interest rates during the year ended december 31 2007 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 451 million as compared to 207 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2007 was 596 as compared to 621 for the year ended december 31 2006 

income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately 18 million primarily due to a taxable gain incurred in 2006 on a partially owned land parcel partially offset by refunds received in 2006 as a result of a change in tax status of a portfolio of partially owned consolidated properties 

income from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately 10 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily due to the sale of the company’s 7075 ownership interest in wellsford park highlands corporation an entity which owns a condominium development in denver colorado and profit participation received from the sale of condominium units at a development project that was sold in 2003 

net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased 23 million primarily as a result of a 26 million gain on the sale of an unconsolidated institutional joint venture property during the year ended december 31 2007

capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate 

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories 

 

      all replacements are depreciated over a fiveyear estimated useful life we expense as incurred all makeready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 

 

        all building improvements are depreciated over a five to tenyear estimated useful life we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 2500 selected projects must exceed 10000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii improves the value of the asset 

  

for the year ended december 31 2008 our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately 1698 million this includes the following amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts

capitalized improvements to real estate 

for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

  

    the company incurred less in capitalized improvements per unit and overall in 2008 primarily due to enhanced efforts to limit the scope of projects and greater cost controls on vendors for 2009 the company estimates an annual stabilized run rate of approximately 925 per unit of capital expenditures for its established properties the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

during the year ended december 31 2008 the company’s total nonreal estate capital additions such as computer software computer equipment and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company’s property management offices and its corporate offices were approximately 23 million the company expects to fund approximately 20 million in total additions to nonreal estate property in 2009 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

  

improvements to real estate and additions to nonreal estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow 

derivative instruments 

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company seeks to limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place 

see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31 2008 

other 

total distributions paid in january 2009 amounted to 1422 million excluding distributions on partially owned properties which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2008 

minority interests as of december 31 2008 decreased by 395 million when compared to december 31 2007 primarily as a result of the following 

 

    offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

the company has coinvested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the company’s liquidity cash flows capital resources credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities during 2000 and 2001 the company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner at the respective closing dates the company sold andor contributed 45 properties containing 10846 units to these ventures and retained a 25 ownership interest in the ventures the company’s joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75 of the agreedupon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures which was then distributed to the company the company’s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets the company sold three properties consisting of 670 units and one property consisting of 400 units during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the company and its joint venture partner currently intend to wind up these investments over the next few years by selling the related assets the company cannot estimate what if any profit it will receive from these dispositions or if the company will in fact receive its equity back 

as of december 31 2008 the company has 10 projects totaling 3568 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through june 30 2011 the development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in note 18 of the company’s consolidated financial statements 

see also notes 2 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s investments in partially owned entities 

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of december 31 2008 

  

  

    critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2008 and are consistent with the year ended december 31 2007 

the company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the six critical accounting policies are 

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators of permanent impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions and legal and environmental concerns as well as the company’s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

depreciation of investment in real estate 

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

cost capitalization 

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 

  

the company follows the guidance in sfas no 67 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as constructioninprogress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

the company follows the guidance under sfas no 157 when valuing its financial instruments the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 107 and sfas no 133 as amended requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 

revenue recognition 

rental income attributable to residential leases is recorded on a straightline basis which is not materially different than if it were recorded when due from residents and recognized monthly as it is earned leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally yeartoyear renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis 

sharebased compensation 

the company accounts for its sharebased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r sharebased payment  effective january 1 2006 which results in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the share compensation granted 

the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable this model is only one method of valuing options and the company’s use of this model should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy because the company’s share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in management’s opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options and the actual value of the options may be significantly different 

funds from operations 

for the year ended december 31 2008 funds from operations “ffo” available to common shares and op units decreased 918 million or 127 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 for the year ended december 31 2007 ffo available to common shares and op units increased 73 million or 10 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates and changes in the sifma index for taxexempt debt the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term credit facilities as well as floating rate taxexempt debt the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment to the extent the company carries as it did at december 31 2008 substantial cash balances this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets lines of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately 50 billion and 47 billion respectively at december 31 2008 

at december 31 2008 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 19 billion or 183 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 34 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 65 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 34 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 65 million 

at december 31 2008 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 86 billion or 817 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 58 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 78 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 58 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 95 billion 

at december 31 2008 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 19000 if market rates of interest permanently increased by 15 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 17 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 15 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 18 million 

at december 31 2007 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 19 billion or 202 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 53 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 102 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 53 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 102 million 

at december 31 2007 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 76 billion or 798 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 58 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 69 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 

  

58 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 84 billion 

at december 31 2007 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 106 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 47 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 65 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 47 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 150 million 

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that longterm debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

acquisition development and disposition strategies 

  

the company anticipates that future property acquisitions developments and dispositions will occur within the united states acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt securities sales of properties joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales in addition eqr may acquire or develop multifamily properties specifically to convert directly into condominiums as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums eqr may also acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities 

  

when evaluating potential acquisitions developments and dispositions the company generally considers the following factors

·   income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market 

·   employment and household growth and net migration of the relevant market ’ s population 

·   barriers to entry that would limit competition zoning laws building permit availability supply of undeveloped or developable real estate local building costs and construction costs among other factors

competition 

  

  all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and singlefamily housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors for additional information with respect to competition 

  

environmental considerations 

  

  see item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

general 

  

the following risk factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “ we ” and “ us ” refer to equity residential and its subsidiaries including erp operating limited partnership 

  

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference interests “interests” of a subsidiary of erp operating limited partnership our operating partnership and limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” in this section we refer to the shares interests units and the op units together as our “securities” and the investors who own shares interests units andor op units as our “security holders” 

  

  

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry   general   real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties these factors include changes in the national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes which could increase over time also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

  

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

  

when our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration we may not be able to relet their units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms because virtually all of our leases are for apartments they are generally for terms of no more than one year if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced 

  

new acquisitions developments andor condominium conversion projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

  

we intend to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental operations andor conversion into condominiums as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired or development property up to standards established for its intended market position additionally we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties or decrease the price at which we expect to sell individual properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we also plan to develop more properties ourselves in addition to coinvesting with our development partners for either the rental or condominium market depending on opportunities in each submarket this may increase the overall level of risk associated with our developments the total number of development units cost of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

  

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

  

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

  

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

  

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial 

  

  

condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders similarly changes that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our securities 

  

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer employment development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

  

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

  

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property 

  

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

  

insurance policy deductibles and exclusions 

  

in order to partially mitigate the substantial increase in insurance costs in recent years management has gradually increased deductible and selfinsured retention amounts as of december 31 2007 the company’s property insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate selfinsured retention of 75 million with approximately 85 of any excess losses being covered by insurance any earthquake and named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of 5 of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate selfinsured retention the company’s general liability and worker’s compensation policies at december 31 2007 provide for a 20 million and 10 million per occurrence deductible respectively these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses but management believes the savings in insurance premium expense justifies this potential increased exposure over the longterm 

  

  

  

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 property insurance carriers have created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “ all risk ” property insurance policies as of december 31 2007 the company was insured for 5000 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 100000 deductible this coverage excludes losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company believes however that the number and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its terrorism insurance coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks 

  

debt financing preferred shares and preference interests and units could adversely affect our performance   general 

  

please refer to item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the company’s total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31 2007 

  in addition to debt we have 2098 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest and preference interests and units with a weighted average dividend preference of 694 per annum as of december 31 2007 our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions 

  

the united states credit markets could experience significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which could cause the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably and make it harder for borrowers to borrow money these circumstances could materially impact liquidity in the debt markets make financing terms for us less attractive and result in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing for example the company has debt obligations where the interest rates reset weekly floating rate tax exempt bond debt we could be negatively impacted by disruptions in this market or in the credit market’s perception of fannie mae and freddie mac who guaranty and provide liquidity for these bonds uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing potential disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally 

  

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

  

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

  

we may not be able to refinance existing debt which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties and may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us 

  

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2007 

  

financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition 

  

if a property we own is mortgaged to secure debt and we are unable to meet the mortgage 

  

  

payments the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property resulting in loss of income and asset value foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the mortgages on our properties may contain negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facilities and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively are terms are defined in the indentures 

  

   

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions we have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited 

  

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

  

our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 470 as of december 31 2007 our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general 

  

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

  

advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders we use interest rate hedging arrangements to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility but these arrangements may expose us to additional risks and no strategy can 

  

  

  

  

completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact and may involve costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them 

  

we depend on our key personnel 

  

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 

  

in the event the chairman of the board andor the ceo are unable to serve i the lead trustee will automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the chairman ii the chairman will automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the ceo and iii the chair of the compensation committee of the board will immediately call a meeting of the committee to recommend to the full board the selection of a permanent replacement for either or both positions as necessary 

  

control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other shareholders 

  

the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the fifth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the “ partnership agreement ”  as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company although these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company’s affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees including mr zell and our executive officers see the company ’ s definitive proxy statement 

  

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

  

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

  

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below also any future series of preferred shares of beneficial interest may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

  

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

  

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ ownership limit ”   absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder ’ s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to 

  

  

reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device in 2004 the company amended the ownership limit to require rather than permit the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit 

  

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

  

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

  

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

  

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “ business combinations ” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting securities an “ interested shareholder ”  or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

  

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

  

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

  

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we fail to qualify as a 

  

  

reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we qualify as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition our corporate housing business and condominium conversion business which are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they have taxable income 

  

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

  

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “ c corporation earnings and profits ” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “ c corporation earnings and profits ” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain in this event we would have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger finally we could be precluded from electing reit status for up to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for reit status 

  

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

  

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

  

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

  

  tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company 

  

  under certain circumstances we may make a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year this election which is provided for in the reit tax code may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year however this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

  

federal income tax considerations   general 

  

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states 

  

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder ’ s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

  

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary 

  

  

and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

  

our taxation 

  

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by our taxable reit subsidiaries 

  

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “ alternative minimum tax ” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “ prohibited transactions ” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the amount by which we fail such gross income test if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

  

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would be disqualified as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

  

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements 

  

  

under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

  

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of “ taxable reit subsidiaries ” or “ trss ”  which are corporations subject to tax as a regular “ c ” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed above which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed to reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

  

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

  

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 

  

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests 

  

1   at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from rents from real property investments in real estate andor real estate mortgages dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments 

2   at least 95 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of income qualifying under the 75 test and dividends nonreal estate mortgage interest some payments under hedging instruments and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities 

  

to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “ tainting ” our rental income only if such services are “ usually or customarily rendered ” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “ impermissible services ”  if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary 

  

  

we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

  

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

  

asset tests  in general at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets 

  

1   at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts and certain cash related items 

2 not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 

75 asset class 

3   except for equity investments in other reits qualified reit subsidiaries ie corporations owned 100 by a reit that are not trss or reits or taxable reit subsidiaries a the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and b we may not own more than 10 of the value of or the voting securities of any one issuer and 

4   not more than 20 of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 

  

the 10 value test described in clause b of 3 above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “ securities ” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer’s debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

  

if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the 

  

  

last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

  

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

  

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 

  

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

  

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

  

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “ qualified dividend income ” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “ qualified dividend income ” to reit shareholders and are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders 

  

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings 

  

  

and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

  

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit ’ s earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess is treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

  

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15 rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution a 15 rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15 an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

  

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

  

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

  

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

  

a   the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition and 

  

b   the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares 

  

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

  

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for 

  

  

six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

  

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

  

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

  

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

  

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “ pensionheld reit ” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

  

taxation of foreign shareholders 

  

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

  

a   a citizen or resident of the united states 

  

b   a corporation or partnership created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof or 

  

c   an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of its source 

  

distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

  

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

  

  

a   a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us or 

  

b   the foreign shareholder files an irs form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income 

  

a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

  

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

  

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “ regularly traded ” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

  

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax as discussed above or 

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a “ tax home ” in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains 

  

except as described above under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability 

  

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as 

  

  

undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against the united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition foreign shareholders would be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

  

foreign shareholders’ sales of common shares  gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder ’ s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain or 

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains 

  

even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

  

a   the class or series of shares being sold is “ regularly traded ” as defined by applicable irs regulations on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange and 

  

b   the selling foreign shareholder owned 5 or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or exchange 

  

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

  

  

  

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

  

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person ’ s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is furnished to the internal revenue service

sharebased payment  effective january 1 2006 which results in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the share compensation granted 

  

the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable this model is only one method of valuing options and the company’s use of this model should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy because the company’s share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in management’s opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options and the actual value of the options may be significantly different 

  

funds from operations 

  

for the year ended december 31 2007 funds from operations “ffo” available to common shares and op units increased 73 million or 10 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 for the year ended december 31 2006 ffo available to common shares and op units decreased 685 million or 87 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and op units for each of the five years ended december 31 2007 

  

funds from operations 

amounts in thousands 

  

 

1 the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines funds from operations “ffo” april 2002 white paper as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis the april 2002 white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only once the company commences the conversion of units to condominiums it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property ffo available to common shares and op units is 

  

  

calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to common shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the operating partnership in exchange for op units are collectively referred to as the “minority interests  operating partnership” subject to certain restrictions the minority interests  operating partnership may exchange their op units for eqr common shares on a oneforone basis 

  

2   the company believes that ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units do not represent net income net income available to common shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income net income available to common shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as measures of liquidity the company’s calculation of ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units may differ from other real estate companies due to among other items variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and accordingly may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates and changes in the sifma index for tax exempt debt the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 

  

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term credit facilities as well as floating rate tax exempt debt the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 

  

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

  

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets lines of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately 37 billion and 56 billion respectively at december 31 2007 

  

at december 31 2007 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 19 billion or 202 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 53 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 102 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 53 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 102 million 

  

at december 31 2007 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 76 billion or 798 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest 

  

  

permanently increased by 58 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company ’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 69 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 58 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 84 billion 

  

at december 31 2007 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 106 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 47 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 65 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 47 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 150 million 

  

at december 31 2006 the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 15 billion or 184 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 49 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 73 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 49 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 73 million 

  

at december 31 2006 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 66 billion or 816 of total debt net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 60 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 60 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 60 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 73 billion 

  

at december 31 2006 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 162 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 54 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 164 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 54 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 162 million 

  

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

  

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

acquisition development and disposition strategies 

  

the company anticipates that future property acquisitions developments and dispositions will occur within the united states acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt securities sales of properties joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales in addition eqr may acquire or develop multifamily properties specifically to convert directly into condominiums as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums eqr may also acquire land parcels to hold andor sell based on market opportunities 

  

when evaluating potential acquisitions developments and dispositions the company generally considers the following factors 

  

•   strategically targeted markets

•   income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market

•   employment and household growth and net migration of the relevant market’s population

•   barriers to entry that would limit competition zoning laws building permit availability supply of undeveloped or developable real estate local building costs and construction costs among other factors

•   the location construction quality condition and design of the property

•   the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow

•   the potential for capital appreciation of the property

•   the terms of resident leases including the potential for rent increases

•   the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located

•   the prospects for liquidity through sale financing or refinancing of the property

•   the benefits of integration into existing operations

•   purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized properties if any

•   competition from existing multifamily properties residential properties under development and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area and

•   opportunistic selling based on demand and price of high quality assets including condominium conversions

competition 

  

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and singlefamily housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors for additional information with respect to competition 

  

environmental considerations 

  

see item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

general 

  

the following risk factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “we” and “us” refer to equity residential and its subsidiaries including erp operating limited partnership 

  

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference interests “interests” of a subsidiary of erp operating limited partnership our operating partnership and limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” in this section we refer to the shares interests units and the op units together as our “securities” and the investors who own shares interests units andor op units as our “security holders” 

  

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry   general   real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties these factors include changes in the national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes which could increase over time also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

  

  

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

  

when our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration we may not be able to relet their units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms because virtually all of our leases are for apartments they are generally for terms of no more than one year if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced 

  

new acquisitions developments andor condominium conversion projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

  

we intend to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental operations andor conversion into condominiums as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired or development property up to standards established for its intended market position additionally we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties or decrease the price at which we expect to sell individual properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we also plan to develop more properties ourselves in addition to coinvesting with our development partners for either the rental or condominium market depending on opportunities in each submarket this may increase the overall level of risk associated with our developments the total number of development units cost of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

  

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

  

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

  

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

  

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders similarly changes that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our securities 

  

we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer employment development condominium conversion tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

  

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic 

  

  

substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

  

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property 

  

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 

  

insurance policy deductibles and exclusions 

  

in order to partially mitigate the substantial increase in insurance costs in recent years management has gradually increased deductible and selfinsured retention amounts as of december 31 2006 the company’s property insurance policy for wholly owned properties provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate selfinsured retention of 75 million with approximately 90 of any excess losses being covered by insurance any earthquake and named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of 5 of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate selfinsured retention the company’s liability and worker’s compensation policies at december 31 2006 provide for a 10 million per occurrence deductible these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses such as the property damage caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters but management believes the savings in insurance premium expense justifies this increased exposure over the longterm 

  

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 property insurance carriers have created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” property insurance policies while separate terrorism insurance coverage is available in certain instances premiums for such coverage are generally very expensive and deductibles are very high additionally the terrorism insurance coverage that is available typically excludes coverage for losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks as of december 31 2006 the company was insured for 500 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 50 million deductible in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company believes however that the number and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its terrorism insurance coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks 

  

  

debt financing preferred shares and preference interests and units could adversely affect our performance   general 

  

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31 2006   in addition to debt we have 3983 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest and preference interests and units with a weighted average dividend preference of 769 per annum as of december 31 2006 our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

  

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

  

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

  

we may not be able to refinance existing debt which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties and may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us 

  

please refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company’s debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2006 

  

financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition 

  

if a property we own is mortgaged to secure debt and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property resulting in loss of income and asset value foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the mortgages on our properties may contain negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facilities and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively are terms are defined in the indentures 

  

  

 

  

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions we have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited 

  

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

  

our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 330 as of december 31 2006 our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general 

  

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

  

advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders we use interest rate hedging arrangements to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility but these arrangements may expose us to additional risks and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact and may involve costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them 

  

we depend on our key personnel 

  

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer and gerald a spector our chief operating officer if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into executive compensation and retirement benefit agreements with the company mr spector has entered into a deferred compensation agreement with the company that under certain conditions could provide him with a salary benefit after his termination of employment with the company in addition mr zell and mr spector have entered into noncompetition agreements with the company 

  

  

in the event the chairman of the board andor the ceo are unable to serve i the lead trustee will automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the chairman ii the chairman will automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the ceo and iii the chair of the compensation committee of the board will immediately call a meeting of the committee to recommend to the full board the selection of a permanent replacement for either or both positions as necessary 

  

control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other shareholders 

  

the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the fifth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company although these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company’s affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees including mr zell and our executive officers see the company’s definitive proxy statement 

  

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

  

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

  

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below also any future series of preferred shares of beneficial interest may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

  

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

  

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device in 2004 the company amended the ownership limit to require rather than permit the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit 

  

  

our preferred shares may affect changes in control 

  

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

  

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

  

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

  

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

  

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

  

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we quality as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal 

  

  

state and local taxes on our income and property in addition our corporate housing business and condominium conversion business which are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

  

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

  

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at the time they merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain in this event we would have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger finally we could be precluded from electing reit status for up to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for reit status 

  

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

  

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

  

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

  

federal income tax considerations   general 

  

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states 

  

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

  

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and 

  

  

existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

  

our taxation 

  

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by our taxable reit subsidiaries 

  

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the amount by which we fail such gross income test if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

  

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would be disqualified as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

  

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be 

  

  

able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

  

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of “taxable reit subsidiaries” or “trss” which are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed above which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed to reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units

  

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

  

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit

  

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests

  

1   at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from rents from real property investments in real estate andor real estate mortgages dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments

2   at least 95 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of income qualifying under the 75 test and dividends nonreal estate mortgage interest some payments under hedging instruments and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities

  

to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in 

  

  

connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

  

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

  

asset tests  in general at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets

  

1   at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts and certain cash related items

2   not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class

3   except for equity investments in other reits qualified reit subsidiaries ie corporations owned 100 by a reit that are not trss or reits or taxable reit subsidiaries a the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and b we may not own more than 10 of the value of or the voting securities of any one issuer and

4   not more than 20 of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries

  

the 10 value test described in clause b of 3 above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered “securities” held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of ¼ of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer’s debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

  

for taxable years commencing on or after january 1 2005 if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we 

  

  

dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

  

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed

  

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies

  

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares

  

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

  

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends made after december 31 2002 which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders and are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders

  

  

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

  

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit’s earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess is treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

  

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15 rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution a 15 rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15 an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

  

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

  

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

  

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

  

a   the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition and

  

b   the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares

  

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

  

  

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

  

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

  

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

  

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

  

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

  

taxation of foreign shareholders 

  

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

  

a   a citizen or resident of the united states

  

b   a corporation or partnership created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof or

  

c   an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of its source

  

distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate

  

  

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

  

a   a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us or

  

b   the foreign shareholder files an irs form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income

  

a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

  

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

  

from and after the taxable year ending december 31 2005 any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

  

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax as discussed above or

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains

  

except as described above under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above we 

  

  

are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability 

  

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against the united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition foreign shareholders would be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

  

foreign shareholders’ sales of common shares  gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain or

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains

  

even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

  

a   the class or series of shares being sold is “regularly traded” as defined by applicable irs regulations on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange and

  

b   the selling foreign shareholder owned 5 or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or exchange

  

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

  

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

  

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of 

  

  

distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is furnished to the internal revenue service

results of operations 

  

in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy the company has continued to invest or recycle its capital investment in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 in summary we 

  

year ended december 31 2006 

  

•   acquired 18 billion of apartment properties consisting of 35 properties and 8768 units and 1344 million of land parcels all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets and

•   sold 23 billion of apartment properties consisting of 335 properties and 39608 units as well as 1069 condominium units for 2160 million and 16 million of land parcels

  

year ended december 31 2005 

  

•   acquired 25 billion of apartment properties consisting of 41 properties and 12059 units and 1383 million of land parcels all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets and

•   sold 14 billion of apartment properties consisting of 50 properties and 12848 units as well as 2241 condominium units for 5933 million and five land parcels for 1083 million

  

on june 28 2006 the company announced that it agreed to sell its lexford housing division for a cash purchase price of 1086 billion the sale closed on october 5 2006 the lexford housing division results are classified as discontinued operations net of minority interests in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented the company recorded a gain on sale of approximately 4187 million on the sale of the lexford housing division in the fourth quarter of 2006 in conjunction with the lexford disposition the company paid offextinguished 1963 million of mortgage notes payable secured by the properties and incurred approximately 92 million in prepayment penalties upon extinguishment 

  

the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment communities 

  

properties that the company owned for all of both 2006 and 2005 the “2006 same store properties” which represented 128133 units impacted the company’s results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2005 and 2004 the “2005 same store properties” which represented 154854 units also impacted the company’s results of operations both the 2006 same store properties and 2005 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

  

the company’s acquisition disposition completed development and consolidation of previously unconsolidated property and variable interest entity activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 the impacts of these activities are also discussed in greater

comparison of the year ended december 31 2006 to the year ended december 31 2005 

  

for the year ended december 31 2006 income from continuing operations net of minority interests decreased by approximately 468 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease in continuing operations is discussed below 

  

revenues from the 2006 same store properties increased 887 million primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged to residents expenses from the 2006 same store properties increased 239 million primarily due to higher maintenance payroll utility costs and real estate taxes the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2006 same store properties 

  

   

1   average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units for the period

  

the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to noi for the 2006 same store properties 

  

 

  

for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1 2006 and expects to continue to own through december 31 2007 the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2007 

  

  

 

  

these 2007 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

  

nonsame store operating results increased 1510 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2006 and 2005 as well as our corporate housing business 

  

see also note 20 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s segment disclosures 

  

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses decreased 15 million primarily as a result of lower income earned from managing fewer properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities as of december 31 2006 and 2005 the company managed 15020 units and 16269 units respectively for third parties and unconsolidated entities 

  

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased by approximately 93 million or 107 this increase is primarily attributable to higher overall payroll costs and higher overall computer and training costs specific to the company’s rollout of a new property management system

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses decreased approximately 219 million between the periods under comparison this decrease was primarily due to lower executive compensation expense due to severance costs for several executive officers incurred during the year ended december 31 2005 and a 28 million reimbursement of legal expenses during the year ended december 31 2006 the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 500 million to 520 million for the year ending december 31 2007 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

  

impairment from continuing operations increased 334 million between periods under comparison this increase was primarily due to an impairment charge on goodwill of 300 million related to the corporate housing business and 20 million related to the writeoff of various deferred sales costs following the decision to halt the condominium conversion and sale process at five assets 

  

interest and other income from continuing operations decreased by approximately 373 million primarily as a result of the 571 million in cash received during the year ended december 31 2005 for the company’s ownership interest in rentcom which was acquired by ebay inc this was partially offset by the 37 million in additional proceeds for rentcom an increase in interest earned on tax deferred 1031 exchange proceeds from the lexford disposition and 147 million of forfeited deposits for various terminated transactions received during the year ended december 31 2006 

  

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 674 million primarily as a result of higher variable interest rates and overall debt levels outstanding during the year ended december 31 2006 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 207 million as compared to 137 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2006 was 621 as compared to 616 for the year ended december 31 2005

net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities decreased 10 million due to increased unconsolidated sales during the year ended december 31 2005 

  

net gain on sales of land parcels decreased 275 million due to a large gain recorded on the sale of one land parcel during the year ended december 31 2005 

  

discontinued operations net of minority interests increased approximately 2578 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily the result of lower real estate net book values for properties sold during the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005 see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2005 to the year ended december 31 2004 

  

for the year ended december 31 2005 income from continuing operations net of minority interests increased by approximately 585 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in continuing operations is discussed below 

  

revenues from the 2005 same store properties increased 619 million primarily as a result of lower concessions provided residents and a slight increase in average occupancy rates expenses from the 2005 same store properties increased 362 million primarily due to higher payroll utility costs and real estate taxes the following tables provide comparative revenue expense noi and weighted average occupancy for the 2005 same store properties

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased by approximately 102 million or 133 this increase is primarily attributable to higher overall payroll costs including bonuses longterm compensation costs and an increase of the company’s match for employee 401k contributions 

  

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased 589 million primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on newly acquired properties and capital expenditures for all properties involved

net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities decreased 33 million primarily due to a decrease in the number of unconsolidated entities sold

discontinued operations net of minority interests increased approximately 3309 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily the result of higher per unit sales prices and lower real estate net book values for properties sold during the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 as well as higher condominium sales the company recognized 916 million and 321 million of net incremental gain on sales of condominium units net of provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively

derivative instruments 

  

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 

  

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

the company has coinvested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the company’s liquidity capital resources credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities during 2000 and 2001 the company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner at the respective closing dates the company sold andor contributed 45 properties containing 10846 units to these ventures and retained a 25 ownership interest in the ventures the company’s joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75 of the agreedupon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures which was then distributed to the company the company’s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets 

  

as of december 31 2006 the company has 11 projects totaling 3448 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through june 30 2009 the development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in note 18 of the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

see also notes 2 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s investments in partially owned entities

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2006 and are consistent with the year ended december 31 2005 

  

the company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the six critical accounting policies are 

  

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

  

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators of permanent impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions expected 

  

  

holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

  

depreciation of investment in real estate 

  

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

  

cost capitalization 

  

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 

  

the company follows the guidance in sfas no 67 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovation at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 

  

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

  

the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 107 and sfas no 133 and its amendments sfas nos 137138149 requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 

  

revenue recognition 

  

rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned which is not materially different than on a straightline basis leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally yeartoyear renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

the company accounts for its sharebased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123 r sharebased payment  effective january 1 2006 which results in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the share compensation granted 

  

the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable this model is only one method 

  

  

of valuing options and the company’s use of this model should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy because the company’s share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in management’s opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options and the actual value of the options may be significantly different 

  

funds from operations 

  

for the year ended december 31 2006 funds from operations “ffo” available to common shares and op units decreased 685 million or 87 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 for the year ended december 31 2005 ffo available to common shares and op units increased 1329 million or 204 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and op units for each of the five years ended december 31 2006 

  

funds from operations 

amounts in thousands 

  

   

1   the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines funds from operations “ffo” april 2002 white paper as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis the april 2002 white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only once the company commences the conversion of units to condominiums it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property 

  

2   the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies ffo in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore ffo should not be exclusively considered as an 

  

  

alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity the company’s calculation of ffo may differ from other real estate companies due to among other items variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and accordingly may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 

  

3   gain on sales of discontinued operations net of minority interests has been reduced by approximately 45 million in onetime accrued retention benefits for the year ended december 31 2006 related to the previously announced october 5 2006 closing of the lexford housing division disposition 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 

  

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving credit facilities the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 

  

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

  

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets lines of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses rents received in advance and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were approximately 32 billion and 45 billion respectively at december 31 2006 

  

the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 15 billion or 184 of total debt at december 31 2006 net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 49 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 73 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 49 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 73 million 

  

at december 31 2006 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 66 billion net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 60 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 60 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 60 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 73 billion 

  

at december 31 2006 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 162 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 54 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 164 million if market rates of interest 

  

  

permanently decreased by 54 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 162 million 

  

the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 19 billion or 249 of total debt at december 31 2005 net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 37 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 71 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 37 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 71 million 

  

at december 31 2005 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 57 billion net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 63 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 52 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 63 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 63 billion 

  

at december 31 2005 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 60 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 49 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 01 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 49 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 115 million 

  

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

  

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

acquisition development and disposition strategies 

  

the company anticipates that future property acquisitions and developments will occur within the united states acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt securities sales of properties joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings in addition the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part the recognition of taxable income or gain which might otherwise result from the sales 

  

when evaluating potential acquisitions developments and dispositions the company generally considers the following factors 

  

•   strategically targeted markets

•   income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market

•   employment and household growth and net migration of the relevant market’s population

•   barriers to entry that would limit competition zoning laws building permit availability supply of undeveloped or developable real estate local building costs and construction labor costs among other factors

•   the location construction quality condition and design of the property

•   the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow

•   the potential for capital appreciation of the property

•   the terms of resident leases including the potential for rent increases

•   the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located

  

  

•   the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity the overall market and submarket

•   the prospects for liquidity through sale financing or refinancing of the property

•   the benefits of integration into existing operations

•   purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized properties if any

•   competition from existing multifamily properties residential properties under development and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area and 

•   opportunistic selling based on demand and price of high quality assets including condominium conversions

  

the company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition and development strategies in addition when feasible the company may structure these transactions as tax deferred exchanges

competition 

  

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and singlefamily housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties see item 1a risk factors for additional information with respect to competition 

  

environmental considerations 

  

see item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

general 

  

the following risk factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “we” and “us” refer to equity residential and its subsidiaries including erp operating limited partnership 

  

  

the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect possibly in a material manner our business financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference interests “interests” of a subsidiary of erp operating limited partnership our operating partnership in this section we refer to the shares interests units and the op units together as our “securities” and the investors who own shares interests units andor op units as our “security holders” 

  

our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry   general   real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties these factors include changes in the national regional and local economic climates local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes which could increase over time also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

  

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

  

when our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration we may not be able to relet their units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms because virtually all of our leases are for apartments they are generally for terms of no more than one year if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced 

  

new acquisitions developments andor condominium conversion projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

  

we intend to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental operations andor specifically to convert directly into condominiums as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired or condominium conversion property up to standards established for its intended market position or to develop a property additionally we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties or decrease the price we expect to sell individual condominiums we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we also plan to develop more properties ourselves in addition to coinvesting with our development partners for either the rental or condominium market depending on opportunities in each submarket this may increase the overall level of risk associated with developments the total number of development units cost of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

  

  

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

  

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

  

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

  

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate or other federal state or local taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders similarly changes that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our securities 

  

as the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to proceedings related to consumer employment tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

  

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

  

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

over the past four years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties other than the company alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property 

  

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties 

  

  

insurance policy deductibles and exclusions 

  

in order to partially mitigate the substantial increase in insurance costs in recent years management has determined to gradually increase deductible and selfinsured retention amounts as of december 31 2005 the company’s property insurance policy for wholly owned properties provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate selfinsured retention of 75 million with any excess losses being covered by insurance any earthquake and named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of 2 5 for california earthquakes of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate selfinsured retention the company’s liability and worker’s compensation policies at december 31 2005 provide for a 10 million per occurrence deductible these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses such as the property damage caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters but management believes the savings in insurance premium expense justifies this increased exposure over the longterm 

  

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 property insurance carriers have created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” property insurance policies while separate terrorism insurance coverage is available in certain instances premiums for such coverage are generally very expensive and deductibles are very high additionally the terrorism insurance coverage that is available typically excludes coverage for losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks at the present time the company has determined that it is not economically prudent to obtain property terrorism insurance for its entire portfolio to the extent otherwise available especially given the significant risks that are not covered by such insurance as of december 31 2005 the company’s highrise properties were insured for 300 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 25 million deductible in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of the properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company believes however that the number and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its highrise terrorism insurance coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks 

  

debt financing preferred shares and preference interests and units could adversely affect our performance   general 

  

the company’s total debt summary as of december 31 2005 included   12 

  

  

   

1 net of the effect of any derivative instruments 

  

in addition to debt we have 5643 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest and preference interests and units with a weighted average dividend preference of 798 per annum as of december 31 2005 our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

  

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

  

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

  

we may not be able to refinance existing debt which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties and may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us the company’s debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2005 is as follows 

  

  

  

  

   

   

financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition 

  

if a property we own is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property resulting in loss of income and asset value foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the mortgages on our properties may contain negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facilities and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material indebtedness our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively are terms are defined in the indentures 

  

  

  

  

   

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions we have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited 

  

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

  

our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 37 as of december 31 2005 our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general 

  

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

  

advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expenses under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders we use interest rate hedging arrangements to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility but these arrangements may expose us to additional risks and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact and may involve costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate them 

  

we depend on our key personnel 

  

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly david j neithercut our president and chief executive officer and gerald a spector our chief operating officer if they resign our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into executive compensation and retirement benefit agreements with the company mr spector has entered into a deferred compensation agreement with the company that under certain conditions could provide him with a salary benefit after his termination of employment with the company in addition mr zell and mr spector have entered into noncompetition agreements with the company 

  

  

in the event the chairman of the board andor the ceo are unable to serve i the lead trustee shall automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the chairman ii the chairman shall automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the ceo and iii the chair of the compensation committee of the board will immediately call a meeting of the committee to recommend to the full board the selection of a permanent replacement for either or both positions as necessary 

  

control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other shareholders 

  

as of december 31 2005 samuel zell our chairman of the board certain affiliates of mr zell and certain of our executive officers and trustees owned or could potentially acquire upon the exchange of op units held by certain of such parties a number of our common shares in addition the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the fifth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of erp operating limited partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company although these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company’s affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees including mr zell and our executive officers see the company’s definitive proxy statement 

  

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

  

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

  

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below also any future series of preferred shares of beneficial interest may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

  

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

  

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device in 2004 the company amended the ownership limit to require rather than permit the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit 

  

  

our preferred shares of beneficial interest may affect changes in control 

  

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares of beneficial interest and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 

  

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

  

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

  

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

  

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

  

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders even if we quality as a reit we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal 

  

  

state and local taxes on our income and property in addition our third party management operations corporate housing business and condominium conversion business which are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

  

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

  

if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at the time they were merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain in this event we would have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger finally we could be precluded from electing reit status for up to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for reit status 

  

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

  

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

  

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

  

federal income tax considerations   general 

  

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states 

  

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

  

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and 

  

  

existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

  

our taxation 

  

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities as a result we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by our taxable reit subsidiaries 

  

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the amount by which we fail such gross income test if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

  

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would be disqualified as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

  

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements 

  

  

under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

  

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of “taxable reit subsidiaries” or “trss” which are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed above which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests however the reit will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100 federal income tax liability imposed to reits income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units

  

trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount the trss will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 

  

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit

  

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests

  

1   at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from rents from real property investments in real estate andor real estate mortgages dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments

2   at least 95 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of income qualifying under the 75 test and dividends nonreal estate mortgage interest some payments under hedging instruments and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities

  

to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor 

  

  

from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

  

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

  

asset tests  in general at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets

  

1   at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts and certain cash related items

2   not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class

3   except for equity investments in other reits qualified reit subsidiaries ie corporations owned 100 by a reit that are not trss or reits or taxable reit subsidiaries a the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and b we may not own more than 10 of the value of or the voting securities of any one issuer and

4   not more than 20 of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries

  

  the 10 value test described in clause b of 3 above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code under the safe harbor the following are not considered securities held by us for purposes of this 10 value test i straight debt securities ii any loan of an individual or an estate iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity or vi any security issued by a reit the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of 14 of 1 or 5 of the annual yield to maturity or we own 1000000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuers debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt if we hold indebtedness from any issuer including a reit the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 

  

for taxable years commencing on or after january 1 2005 if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

  

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and 

  

  

if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 

  

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies

  

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares

  

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

  

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends made after december 31 2002 which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders and are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders

  

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

  

dividends declared by a reit in october november or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year however this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit’s earnings and profits existing on december 31 to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31 the excess is treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid as such for tax reporting purposes january distributions paid to 

  

  

our shareholders may be split between two tax years 

  

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15 rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution a 15 rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15 an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

  

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

  

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

  

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

  

a   the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition and

  

b   the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares

  

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

  

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

  

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

  

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or 

  

  

business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

  

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

  

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

  

taxation of foreign shareholders 

  

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

  

a   a citizen or resident of the united states

  

b   a corporation or partnership created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof or

  

c   an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of its source

  

distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate

  

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

  

a   a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us or

  

b   the foreign shareholder files an irs form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income

  

a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common 

  

  

shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

  

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

  

  from and after the taxable year ending december 31 2005 any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is regularly traded on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty as described above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

  

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax as discussed above or

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains

  

except as described above under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability 

  

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against the united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition foreign shareholders would be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

  

foreign shareholders’ sales of common shares  gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if 

  

  

either 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain or

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains

  

even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

  

a   the class or series of shares being sold is “regularly traded” as defined by applicable irs regulations on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange and

  

b   the selling foreign shareholder owned 5 or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or exchange

  

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

  

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

  

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is furnished to the internal revenue service

 item 2 properties 

  

as of december 31 2005 the company directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities owned all or a portion of 926 properties in 31 states and the district of columbia consisting of 197404 units the company’s properties are more fully described as follows

results of operations 

  

in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy the company has continued to invest or recycle its capital investment in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 in summary we 

  

year ended december 31 2005 

  

•   acquired 25 billion of apartment properties consisting of fortyone properties and 12059 units and 1383 million of land parcels all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets and

•   sold 14 billion of apartment properties consisting of 50 properties and 12848 units as well as 2241 condominium units for 5933 million and five land parcels for 1083 million

  

year ended december 31 2004 

  

•   acquired 9008 million of apartment properties consisting of twentyfour properties and 6182 units as well as 124 million of land parcels and

•   sold 7878 million of apartment properties consisting of fiftysix properties and 14159 units as well as 977 condominium units for 1773 million and two land parcels for 279 million

  

the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment communities 

  

properties that the company owned for all of both 2005 and 2004 the “2005 same store properties” which represented 154854 units impacted the company’s results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2004 and 2003 the “2004 same store properties” which represented 162201 units also impacted the company’s results of operations both the 2005 same store properties and 2004 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

  

the company’s acquisition disposition completed development and consolidation of previously unconsolidated property and variable interest entity activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 the impacts of these activities are also discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs 

  

  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2005 to the year ended december 31 2004 

  

for the year ended december 31 2005 income from continuing operations increased by approximately 347 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in continuing operations is discussed below 

  

revenues from the 2005 same store properties increased 619 million primarily as a result of lower concessions provided residents and a slight increase in average rent per unit and occupancy rates expenses from the 2005 same store properties increased 362 million primarily due to higher payroll utility costs and real estate taxes the following tables provide comparative revenue expense noi and weighted average occupancy for the 2005 same store properties

for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1 2005 and expects to continue to own through december 31 2006 the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2006 

  

 

  

these 2006 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

  

nonsame store operating results increased 786 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2005 and 2004 as well as our corporate housing business 

  

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses decreased by 17 million primarily as a result of lower income earned from ft lewis and managing fewer properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities as of december 31 2005 and 2004 the company managed 16269 units and 17988 units respectively for third parties and unconsolidated entities 

  

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased by approximately 72 million or 94 this increase is primarily attributable to higher overall payroll costs including bonuses longterm compensation costs and an increase of the company’s match for employee 401k contributions 

  

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased 628 million primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on newly acquired properties and capital expenditures for all properties owned 

  

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 225 million between the periods under comparison this increase was primarily due to higher executive compensation expense due to severance costs of 98 million for several executive officers 79 million of additional accruals specific to performance shares for selected executive officers and a 25 million profit sharing accrual to be paid in the first quarter of 2006 the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 500 million for the year ending december 31 2006 the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forwardlooking 

  

interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately 596 million primarily as a result of the 571 million in cash received for the company’s ownership interest in rentcom which was acquired by ebay inc 

  

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 562 million primarily as a result of higher overall debt balances as well as higher variable interest rates during the year ended december 31 2005 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 137 million as compared to 140 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2005 was 616 as compared to 587 for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

income loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately 78 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily the result of consolidation of properties that were previously unconsolidated in the first quarter of 2004 

  

net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities decreased 33 million primarily due to a decrease in 

  

  

the number of unconsolidated entities sold 

  

net gain on sales of land parcels increased 248 million primarily due to an increase in the number of land parcels sold and large gains recorded on two land parcels located in tyson’s corner virginia 

  

net gain on sales of discontinued operations increased approximately 3792 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily the result of higher per unit sales prices and lower real estate net book values for properties sold during the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 as well as higher condominium sales the company recognized 916 million and 321 million of net incremental gain on sales of condominium units net of provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

discontinued operations net decreased approximately 244 million between the periods under comparison the decrease in revenues and expenses between periods results from the timing size and number of properties sold any property sold after december 31 2004 will include a full period’s results in the year ended december 31 2004 but minimal to no results in the year ended december 31 2005 see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

revenues from the 2004 same store properties increased 141 million primarily as a result of lower concessions provided residents and a slight increase in occupancy rates expenses from the 2004 same store properties increased 225 million primarily due to higher payroll utility costs and real estate taxes the following tables provide comparative revenue expense noi and weighted average occupancy for the 2004 same store properties 

  

 

  

 

  

1   year 2004 expenses exclude 152 million of uninsured property damage caused by hurricanes charley frances ivan and jeanne 

  

 

  

nonsame store operating results are primarily from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2004 same store properties and the consolidation of all previously unconsolidated development projects 

  

  

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses decreased by 42 million primarily as a result of lower income earned from ft lewis and managing fewer properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the company managed 17988 units and 18475 units respectively for third parties and unconsolidated entities 

  

property management expenses from continuing operations include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased by approximately 70 million or 101 this increase is primarily attributable to higher payroll costs including bonuses and longterm compensation costs as well as severance costs for certain employees in addition the property management company experienced slightly higher costs for travel temporary help internal conferences and legal and professional fees 

  

depreciation expense from continuing operations which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased 624 million primarily as a result of the consolidation of previously unconsolidated projects and properties acquired after december 31 2003 many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired and also due to additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned 

  

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 123 million between the periods under comparison this increase was primarily due to the costs of consulting services rendered to increase operating efficiencies and increased litigation and internal control costs partially offset by 14 million of immediate expense recognition related to options granted in the first quarter of 2003 to the company’s former chief executive officer consulting services were contracted to enhance resident satisfactionretention unit pricing and expense procurementreduction

interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately 66 million primarily as a result of lower balances available for investments including deposits in tax deferred exchange accounts and collateral agreements related to development projects 

  

interest expense from continuing operations including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 127 million this increase was primarily attributable to increases in mortgage and unsecured note balances and lower capitalized interest during the year ended december 31 2004 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 140 million as compared to 206 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in partially owned properties consolidated engaged in development activities the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2004 was 587 as compared to 636 for the year ended december 31 2003

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

  

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators of permanent impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

  

depreciation of investment in real estate 

  

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 

  

the company follows the guidance in sfas no 67 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovation at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 

  

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

  

the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 107 and sfas no 133 and its amendments sfas nos 137138149 requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 

  

revenue recognition 

  

rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned which is not materially different than on a straightline basis leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally yeartoyear renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

the company elected to account for its stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123 and its amendment sfas no 148 accounting for stock based compensation  effective in the first quarter of 2003 which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted 

  

the company elected the “prospective method” which requires expensing of employee awards granted or modified after january 1 2003 compensation expense under all of the company’s plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee awards 

  

funds from operations 

  

for the year ended december 31 2005 funds from operations “ffo” available to common shares and op units increased 1329 million or 204 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 for the year ended december 31 2004 ffo available to common shares and op units increased 114 million or 18 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 

  

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and op units for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   

1   the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines funds from operations “ffo” april 2002 white paper as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis the april 2002 white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only once the company commences the conversion of units to condominiums it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property 

  

2   the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies ffo in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore ffo should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity the company’s calculation of ffo may differ from other real estate companies due to among other items variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and accordingly may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

market risks relating to the company’s financial instruments result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 

  

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving credit facilities the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 

  

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

  

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets lines of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses rents received in advance and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were both approximately 36 billion at december 31 2005 

  

the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 19 billion or 249 of total debt at december 31 2005 net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 37 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 71 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 37 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 71 million 

  

at december 31 2005 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 57 billion net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 63 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 52 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 63 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 63 billion 

  

at december 31 2005 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 60 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 49 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 01 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 49 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 115 million 

  

the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 14 billion or 215 of total debt at december 31 2004 net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 25 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 35 million if market rates of interest on all of the 

  

  

floating rate debt permanently decreased by 25 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 35 million 

  

at december 31 2004 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 51 billion net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 65 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 46 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 65 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 56 billion 

  

at december 31 2004 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 79 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 40 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 139 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 40 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 22 million 

  

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

  

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

the company’s strategy for accomplishing these objectives include 

  

•   leveraging our size and scale in four critical ways 

  

•   investing or “recycling” capital investments in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets to maximize our total return on an enterprise level 

•   meeting the needs of our customers by offering a wide array of product choices and a commitment to service 

•   engaging retaining and attracting the best people by providing them with the education resources and opportunities to succeed and 

•   sharing resources customers and best practices in property management and across the enterprise 

  

•   owning a highly diversified portfolio by investing in target markets defined by a combination of the following criteria 

  

•   high barriertoentry low supply 

•   strong economic predictors high demand and 

•   attractive quality of life high demand and retention 

  

•   giving customers reasons to stay with equity by providing a range of product options available in our diversified portfolio and by enhancing their experience through our employees and our services

acquisition and development strategies 

  

the company anticipates that future property acquisitions and developments will occur within the united states acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt securities sales of properties joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings in addition the company may acquire additional properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in part the recognition of taxable income or gain which might otherwise result from the sales 

  

when evaluating potential acquisitions and developments the company generally considers the following factors 

  

•   the geographic area and type of community 

•   the location construction quality condition and design of the property 

•   the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow 

•   the potential for capital appreciation of the property 

•   the terms of resident leases including the potential for rent increases 

•   income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market

•   employment and household growth and net migration of the relevant market’s population

•   the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located 

•   the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity the overall market and submarket 

  

  

•   the prospects for liquidity through sale financing or refinancing of the property 

•   the benefits of integration into existing operations 

•   barriers to entry that would limit competition zoning laws building permit availability supply of undeveloped or developable real estate local building costs and construction labor costs among other factors

•   purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized communities if any and

•   competition from existing multifamily properties residential properties under development and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area 

  

disposition strategies 

  

when evaluating potential dispositions the company generally considers the following factors 

  

•   low barriertoentry high supply 

•   weak economic predictors low demand 

•   markets where the company does not intend to establish longterm concentrations 

•   age or location of a particular property and 

•   opportunistic selling based on demand and price of high quality assets including condominium conversions 

  

the company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition and development strategies in addition when feasible the company may structure these transactions as tax deferred exchanges 

  

financing strategies 

  

the company’s “consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio” as of december 31 2004 is presented in the following table the company calculates the equity component of its market capitalization as the sum of i the total outstanding common shares and assumed conversion of all op units at the equivalent market value of the closing price of the company’s common shares on the new york stock exchange ii the “common share equivalent” of all convertible preferred shares and preference interestsunits and iii the liquidation value of all perpetual preferred shares and preference interests outstanding 

  

  

capitalization as of december 31 2004 

  

   

convertible preferred shares preference interests and junior preference units as of december 31 2004 

  

   

the company’s policy is to maintain a ratio of consolidated debttototal market capitalization of less than 50 and not incur indebtedness other than shortterm trade employee compensation or similar indebtedness that will be paid in the ordinary course of business

the operating partnership is currently negotiating a new credit facility to replace or expand its existing facility and fully expects to obtain this at current or improved terms in march or april 2005 

  

business combinations

for the year ended december 31 2002 the company recorded approximately 171 million of asset impairment charges related to ech following the guidance in sfas no 142 these charges were the result of the company’s decision to reduce the carrying value of ech to 300 million given the weakness in the economy and management’s expectations for nearterm performance and were determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of the business this impairment loss is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations as impairment on corporate housing business and on the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in goodwill net 

  

  

competition 

  

all of the company’s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and singlefamily housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties throughout 2003 and 2004 historically low mortgage interest rates coupled with increased residential construction and singlefamily home sales have had an adverse competitive effect on the company 

  

risk factors 

  

the following risk factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “we” and “us” refer to equity residential and its subsidiaries including erp operating limited partnership 

  

set forth below are the risks that we believe are important to investors who purchase or own our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference interests “interests” of a subsidiary of erp operating limited partnership preference units “units” or units of limited partnership interest “op units” of erp operating limited partnership our operating partnership which are redeemable on a oneforone basis for common shares or their cash equivalent in this section we refer to the shares interests units and the op units together as our “securities” and the investors who own shares interests units andor op units as our “security holders” 

  

our performance and share value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry   

general   

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties these factors include changes in the national regional and local economic climate local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes which could increase over time also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

  

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

  

when our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration we may not be able to relet their units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms because virtually all of our leases are for apartments they are generally for terms of no more than one year if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced 

  

  

new acquisitions developments andor condominium conversion projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

  

we intend to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental operations andor specifically to convert directly into condominiums as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired or condominium conversion property up to standards established for its intended market position or to develop a property additionally we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties or decrease the price we expect to sell individual condominiums we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms we also plan to develop more properties ourselves over the next few years in addition to coinvesting with our development partners for either the rental or condominium market depending on opportunities in each submarket this may increase the overall level of risk associated with developments the total number of development units cost of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

  

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

  

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

  

changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business 

  

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate taxes income taxes or other taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders similarly changes that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our securities 

  

as the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties we may become involved in legal proceedings including but not limited to consumer employment tort and commercial that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 

  

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

  

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

over the past four years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties other than the company alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in 

  

  

substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property

  

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties 

  

insurance policy deductibles and exclusions 

  

in order to partially mitigate the substantial increase in insurance costs in recent years management has determined to gradually increase deductible and selfinsured retention amounts as of december 31 2004 the company’s property insurance policy for wholly owned properties provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and self insured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate self insured retention of 75 million the company’s liability and worker’s compensation policies at december 31 2004 provide for a 10 million per occurrence deductible these higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses such as the property damage caused by hurricanes charley frances ivan and jeanne but management believes the savings in insurance premium expense justifies this increased exposure over the longterm 

  

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 property insurance carriers have created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” insurance policies while separate terrorism insurance coverage is available in certain instances premiums for such coverage are generally very expensive and deductibles are very high additionally the terrorism insurance coverage that is available typically excludes coverage for losses from nuclear biological and chemical attacks at the present time the company has determined that it is not economically prudent to obtain property terrorism insurance for its entire portfolio to the extent otherwise available especially given the significant risks that are not covered by such insurance as of december 31 2004 the company’s highrise properties were insured for 125 million in terrorism insurance coverage with a 5 million deductible in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of the properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company believes however that the number and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its highrise terrorism insurance coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks 

  

  

debt financing preferred shares and preference interests and units could adversely affect our performance   

general 

  the company’s total debt summary as of december 31 2004 included   

debt summary 

  

   

   

in addition to debt we have 8424 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest and preference interests and units with a weighted average dividend preference of 823 per annum as of december 31 2004 our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

  

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

  

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

  

we may not be able to refinance existing debt which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties and may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us the company’s debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2004 is as follows 

  

  

debt maturity schedule 

  

   

1 includes 300 million of unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2015 that is putablecallable in 2005 

2 includes 150 million outstanding on the company’s unsecured revolving credit facility 

3 includes 150 million of unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2026 that is putable in 2006 

  

financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition 

  

if a property we own is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property resulting in loss of income and asset value foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material indebtedness our unsecured public debt covenants as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively are terms are defined in the indentures 

  

  

unsecured public debt covenants 

  

   

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions we have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited 

  

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

  

our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 35 as of december 31 2004 we have a policy of incurring indebtedness for borrowed money only through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries and only if upon such incurrence our debt to market capitalization ratio would be approximately 50 or less our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general 

  

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

  

advances under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expenses under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders 

  

we depend on our key personnel 

  

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly bruce w duncan our president and chief executive officer and gerald a spector our chief operating officer if they resign our operations could be temporarily adversely affected mr zell has entered into executive compensation and retirement benefit agreements with the company mr duncan and mr spector have entered into deferred compensation agreements with the company that under certain conditions could provide both with a salary benefit after their respective termination of employment with the company in addition mr zell and mr spector have entered into noncompetition agreements with the company and mr duncan’s employment agreement contains covenants not to compete in favor of the company 

  

in the event the chairman of the board andor ceo are unable to serve i the lead trustee shall automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the chairman ii the chairman shall automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the ceo and iii the chair of the compensation committee of the board will immediately call a meeting of the committee to recommend to the full board the selection of a permanent replacement for either or both positions as necessary 

  

control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other shareholders 

  

as of december 31 2004 samuel zell the chairman of the board of the company and certain of the current holders of op units issued to affiliates of mr zell and our executive officers and trustees owned some of our common shares in addition the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the fifth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of erp operating limited partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the zell affiliates may have influence over the company although these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company’s affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders for additional information regarding the security ownership of mr zell and our executive officers and trustees see the company’s definitive proxy statement 

  

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

  

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

  

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below see “we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes” also any future series of preferred shares of beneficial interest may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

  

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

  

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an antitakeover device on may 28 2004 the company amended the ownership limit to require rather than permit the board to grant a waiver of the 

  

  

ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company’s status as a reit 

  

our preferred shares of beneficial interest may affect changes in control 

  

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares of beneficial interest and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders as of december 31 2004 4108658 preferred shares were issued and outstanding 

  

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

  

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving the zell original owners and persons acting in concert with any of the zell original owners consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

  

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

  

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

  

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for 

  

  

investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders

  

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits 

  

if any of our recent merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at the time they were merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain in this event we would have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger finally we could be precluded from electing reit status for up to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for reit status 

  

other tax liabilities 

  

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition our thirdparty management operations corporate housing business and condominium conversion business which are conducted through subsidiaries generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

  

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

  

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

  

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

  

federal income tax considerations   general 

  

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states 

  

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the 

  

  

application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction

  

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

  

our taxation 

  

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive 

  

we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service if we fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will still generally be subject to a 100 penalty tax on the amount by which we fail such gross income test if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets this relief provision is generally applicable only for our taxable years commencing on or after january 1 2005 if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of 50000 for each such failure this relief provision is generally applicable only for our taxable years commencing on or after january 1 2005 moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

  

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would be disqualified as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

  

  

  

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 

  

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit

  

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests first at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from rents from real property investments in real estate andor real estate mortgages dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments second at least 95 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of income qualifying under the 75 test and dividends nonreal estate mortgage interest some payments under hedging instruments and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions

  

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code in this case a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above generally it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply we will not qualify as a reit 

  

asset tests  in general at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets 1 at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts and certain cash related items 2 not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class 3 except for equity investments in other reits qualified reit subsidiaries ie corporations owned 100 by a reit that are not trss or reits or taxable reit subsidiaries a the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and b we may not own more than 10 of the value of or the voting securities of any one issuer and 4 not more than 20 of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries securities for purposes of the asset tests described in 3 above may include debt securities other than those qualifying as straight debt we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the

  

  

10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service might not disagree with our determinations 

  

for taxable years commencing on or after january 1 2005 if we fail to satisfy the 5 or 10 asset tests described above after a 30day cure period provided in the internal revenue code we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets is de minimis ie does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or 10000000 and we dispose of the nonqualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the 30day cure period by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests we would cease to qualify as a reit 

  

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed

  

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies

  

ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us  the internal revenue code provides that for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of taxable reit subsidiaries or trss which are corporations subject to tax as a regular c corporation that have elected jointly with a reit to be a trs generally a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed above which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests in certain circumstances assets owned by us are sold to our trss in any such sale the price paid by the trs to us is determined on an arms length basis and is supported by third party valuation reports in enacting the taxable reit subsidiary rules congress intended that the arrangements between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries be structured to ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation as a result the internal revenue code imposes certain limits on the ability of a taxable reit subsidiary to deduct interest payments made to us in addition as discussed above we will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties

  

our management company and other subsidiaries  a small portion of the cash to be used by the operating partnership to fund distributions to us is expected to come from payments of dividends from management companies and other subsidiaries of the company that have elected trs status these companies pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates they will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes the cash available for distribution from these management companies by us to shareholders will be reduced accordingly

  

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares

  

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

  

general  if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividend income” under the internal revenue code meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether

  

  

distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of ordinary dividends made after december 31 2002 which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as “qualified dividend income” to reit shareholders and are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our noncorporate shareholders

  

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

  

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a 15 rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution a 15 rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 15 an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

  

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

  

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

  

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

  

a   the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition and

  

b   the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares

  

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

  

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

  

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

  

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

  

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

  

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

  

taxation of foreign shareholders 

  

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

  

a   a citizen or resident of the united states

  

b   a corporation or partnership created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof or

  

c   an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of its source

  

distributions by us  distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate

  

  

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

  

a   a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us or

  

b   the foreign shareholder files an irs form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income

  

a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

  

we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution in such event a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

  

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax as discussed above or

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains

  

under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability 

  

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against the united states 

  

  

federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition foreign shareholders would be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability

  

foreign shareholders sales of common shares    gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain or

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains

  

even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

  

a   the class or series of shares being sold is “regularly traded” as defined by applicable irs regulations on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange and

  

b   the selling foreign shareholder owned 5 or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or exchange

  

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price 

  

information reporting requirement and backup withholding 

  

we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under certain circumstances domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such persons united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund provided that the required information is furnished to the internal revenue service 

  

  

item 2    the properties 

  

as of december 31 2004 the company directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities owned all or a portion of 939 properties in 32 states and the district of columbia consisting of 200149 units the company’s properties are more fully described as follows 

  

 

  

resident leases are generally for twelve months in length and typically require security deposits the gardenstyle properties are generally defined as properties with two andor three story buildings while the midrisehighrise are defined as properties with greater than three story buildings these two property types typically provide residents with amenities which may include a clubhouse swimming pool laundry facilities and cable television access certain of these properties offer additional amenities such as saunas whirlpools spas sports courts and exercise rooms or other amenities the ranchstyle properties are defined as single story properties which do not provide additional amenities for residents other than laundry facilities and cable television access the military housing properties are defined as those properties located on military bases 

  

it is management’s role to monitor compliance with property policies and to provide preventive maintenance of the properties including common areas facilities and amenities the company has a dedicated training and education department that creates and coordinates training and strategic implementation for the company’s property management personnel the company believes that due in part to its emphasis on training and employee quality the properties historically have had high occupancy rates 

  

the distribution of the properties throughout the united states reflects the company’s belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio from regional and economic influences at the same time the company has sought to create clusters of properties within each of its primary markets in order to achieve economies of scale in management and operation the company may nevertheless acquire additional multifamily properties located anywhere in the continental united states

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes the number of properties and related units for the periods presented 

  

   

the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income “noi” the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment communities 

  

properties that the company owned for all of both 2004 and 2003 the “2004 same store properties” which represented 162201 units impacted the company’s results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2003 and 2002 the “2003 same store properties” which represented 171841 units also impacted the company’s results of operations both the 2004 same store properties and 2003 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

  

the company’s acquisition disposition completed development and consolidation of previously unconsolidated property and variable interest entity activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 the impacts of these activities are also discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs 

  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2004 to the year ended december 31 2003 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 income from continuing operations decreased by approximately 226 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2003 during the year ended december 31 2004 the company established a reserve and recorded a corresponding expense of 152 million in estimated uninsured property damage at certain of its properties primarily located in florida caused by hurricanes charley frances ivan and jeanne of this amount approximately 94 million had been spent for hurricane related repairs through december 31 2004 

  

  

revenues from the 2004 same store properties increased 141 million primarily as a result of lower concessions provided residents and a slight increase in occupancy rates expenses from the 2004 same store properties increased 225 million primarily due to higher payroll utility costs and real estate taxes the following tables provide comparative revenue expense noi and weighted average occupancy for the 2004 same store properties 

  

 

  

1   december 2004 expenses exclude the uninsured property damage caused by hurricanes charley frances ivan  jeanne

  

 

  

 

  

the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to noi for the 2004 same store properties 

  

 

  

for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1 2004 and expects to continue to own through december 31 2005 the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2005 

  

  

2005 samestore assumptions 

  

 

  

  

these 2005 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

  

rental income from properties other than 2004 same store properties increased by approximately 1726 million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2004 same store properties and the consolidation of all previously unconsolidated development projects 

  

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses decreased by 39 million primarily as a result of lower income earned from ft lewis and managing fewer properties for third parties and unconsolidated entities as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the company managed 17988 units and 18475 units respectively for third parties and unconsolidated entities 

  

property management expenses include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses increased by approximately 78 million or 115 this increase is primarily attributable to higher payroll costs including bonuses and longterm compensation costs as well as severance costs for certain employees in addition the property management company experienced slightly higher costs for travel temporary help internal conferences and legal and professional fees 

  

depreciation expense which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased 692 million primarily as a result of the consolidation of previously unconsolidated projects and properties acquired after december 31 2003 many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired and also due to additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned 

  

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 124 million or 320 between the periods under comparison this increase was primarily due to the costs of consulting services rendered to increase operating efficiencies and increased litigation and internal control costs this increase was partially offset by 14 million of immediate expense recognition related to options granted in the first quarter of 2003 to the company’s former chief executive officer consulting services were contracted to enhance resident satisfactionretention unit pricing and expense procurementreduction the company believes that these additional expenditures may be more than offset by increased rental revenues andor reduced operating expenses in future years the company also anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate 430 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

  

the company recorded impairment charges on its technology investments of approximately 12 million for the year ended december 31 2003 see note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

interest and other income decreased approximately 55 million primarily as a result of lower balances available for investments including deposits in tax deferred exchange accounts and collateral agreements related to development projects 

  

interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 208 million this increase was primarily attributable to increases in mortgage and unsecured note balances and lower capitalized interest during the year ended december 31 2004 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 140 million as compared to 206 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in partially owned properties consolidated 

  

  

engaged in development activities the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2004 was 587 as compared to 636 for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 28 million between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily the result of consolidation of properties that were previously unconsolidated partially offset by an increase in realized losses on the settlement of derivative instruments 

  

net gain on sales of discontinued operations increased approximately 132 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily the result of an increase in the number of condominium units sold 

  

discontinued operations net decreased approximately 416 million between the periods under comparison see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2003 to the year ended december 31 2002 

  

for the year ended december 31 2003 income from continuing operations decreased by approximately 302 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2002 this decrease was primarily attributable to increased operating expenses incurred including property management costs and depreciation 

  

revenues from the 2003 same store properties decreased by 382 million primarily as a result of lower overall physical occupancy increased concessions and lower rental rates charged to both new and renewal residents property operating expenses from the 2003 same store properties increased by 363 million primarily due to higher payroll maintenance utility real estate taxes insurance leasing and advertising and building costs the following tables provide comparative revenue expense noi and weighted average occupancy for the 2003 same store properties 

  

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

  

rental income from properties other than 2003 same store properties increased by approximately 475 million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2003 same store properties and additional partially owned properties consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002 and during the year ended december 31 2003 

  

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased by 49 million primarily as a result of additional income allocated from ft lewis as of december 31 2003 and 

  

  

2002 the company managed 18475 units and 18965 units respectively for third parties and unconsolidated entities 

  

property management expenses include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses decreased by approximately 44 million or 60 this decrease is primarily attributable to a reversal of a profit sharing accrual in the first quarter of 2003 related to the 2002 calendar year as the company didn’t achieve its stated goals and management elected not to make a discretionary contribution to the plan in addition the company recorded lower expense in connection with granting less restricted shares and reducing the expense associated with the company’s matched funding of its 401k plan during 2003 and not incurring an expense for 2003 discretionary profit sharing contributions 

  

depreciation expense which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased 254 million primarily as a result of properties acquired after december 31 2002 many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired and additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned 

  

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses decreased approximately 77 million between the periods under comparison this decrease was primarily due to lower expenses recorded in connection with granting less restricted shares to employees during 2003 partially offset by approximately a 26 million increase related to the company’s decision to begin to expense its stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 123 and its amendment sfas no 148 in addition lower state income and franchise taxes also contributed to this decrease 

  

the company recorded impairment charges on its technology investments and its corporate housing business of approximately 12 million and 183 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively see note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

interest and other income increased by approximately 14 million primarily as a result of higher cash balances available for shortterm investments throughout 2003 

  

interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 46 million primarily due to lower variable interest rates and lower overall levels of debt during the year ended december 31 2003 the company capitalized interest costs of approximately 206 million as compared to 272 million for the year ended december 31 2002 this capitalization of interest primarily related to equity investments in unconsolidated entities engaged in development activities the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31 2003 was 636 as compared to 654 for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately 64 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily the result of increased operating losses from equity investments partially offset by unrealized gains on derivative instruments 

  

net gain on sales of discontinued operations increased approximately 2064 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily the result of a greater number of properties sold during the year ended december 31 2003 as well as the fact that several properties had lower net carrying values at sale 

  

discontinued operations net decreased approximately 536 million between the periods under comparison see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

derivative instruments

the company expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments generally through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions the company also expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities including additional op units and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants 

  

  

under its unsecured notes and line of credit of the 149 billion in investment in real estate on the company’s balance sheet at december 31 2004 95 billion or 638 was unencumbered 

  

the operating partnership has a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to 7000 million this facility matures in may 2005 and may among other potential uses be used to fund property acquisitions costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements as of march 1 2005 1350 million was outstanding under this facility and 510 million was restricted and dedicated to support letters of credit 

  

the operating partnership is currently negotiating a new credit facility to replace or expand its existing facility and fully expects to obtain this at current or improved terms in march or april 2005 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

the company has coinvested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the company’s liquidity capital resources credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities the nature and business purpose of these ventures are as follows 

  

•   institutional ventures – during 2000 and 2001 the company entered into ventures with an unaffiliated partner at the respective closing dates the company sold andor contributed 45 properties containing 10846 units to these ventures and retained a 25 ownership interest in the ventures the company’s joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75 of the agreedupon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures which was then distributed to the company the company’s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets

  

•   lexfordother – as of december 31 2004 the company has ownership interests in twelve properties containing 1571 units acquired in a prior merger the current weighted average ownership percentage is 110 the company’s strategy with respect to these interests is either to acquire a majority ownership or sell the company’s interest

•   the first development partner has the right at any time following completion of a project subject to the agreement to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the company based on such value if the company chooses not to purchase the interest the company must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value the company’s partner must exercise this right as to all projects subject to the agreement within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property in connection with this development partner the company has an obligation to provide up to 400 million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing as of february 2 2005 the company had setaside 50 million towards this credit enhancement the company would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party construction mortgage agreement this agreement expires no later than december 31 2018 notwithstanding the termination of the agreement the company shall have recourse against its development partner for any losses incurred

  

•   the second development partner has the right at any time following completion of a project subject to the agreement to require the company to purchase the partners’ interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price if the company and the partner are unable to agree on a price both parties will obtain appraisals if the appraised values vary by more than 10 both the company and its

  

  

partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value the company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreedupon value to an unrelated third party five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property the company must purchase at the agreedupon price any projects remaining unsold 

  

•   the third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization as defined to market a subject project for sale thereafter either the company or its development partner may market a subject project for sale if the company’s development partner proposes the sale the company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project if the two appraised values vary by more than 5 a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property once a value has been determined the company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreedupon value 

  

see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company’s investments in unconsolidated entities

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and 

  

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

the company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the six critical accounting policies are 

  

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

  

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators of permanent impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

  

depreciation of investment in real estate 

  

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

  

cost capitalization 

  

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital andor renovation projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 

  

the company follows the guidance in sfas no 67 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes through the date the certificates of occupancy co are issued cos are deemed final within 90 days of issuance interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of onsite employees working directly at our properties except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major rennovation at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 

  

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

  

the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 107 and sfas no 133 and its amendments sfas nos 137138149 requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 

  

  

revenue recognition 

  

rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned which is not materially different than on a straightline basis leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally yeartoyear renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

prior to 2003 the company had chosen to account for its stockbased compensation in accordance with apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  which resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the company’s common shares on the date of grant intrinsic method the company elected to account for its stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123 and its amendment sfas no 148 accounting for stock based compensation  effective in the first quarter of 2003 which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted 

  

sfas no 148 provides three transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 the company elected the “prospective method” which requires expensing of employee awards granted or modified after january 1 2003 compensation expense under all of the company’s plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee awards 

  

funds from operations 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 funds from operations “ffo” available to common shares and op units increased 114 million or 18 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 for the year ended december 31 2003 ffo available to common shares and op units decreased 789 million or 110 as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and op units for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

  

funds from operations 

amounts in thousands 

  

   

1 the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines funds from operations “ffo” april 2002 white paper as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis the april 2002 white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only once the company commences the conversion of units to condominiums it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property 

  

2 the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies ffo in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore ffo should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity the company’s calculation of ffo may differ from other real estate companies due to among other items variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and accordingly may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 

  

  




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

market risks relating to the company’s operations result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 

  

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured line of credit the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 

  

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

  

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets line of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses rents received in advance and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at december 31 2004 

  

the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 13890 million or 215 of total debt at december 31 2004 net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 25 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 35 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 25 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 35 million 

  

at december 31 2004 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 51 billion net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 65 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 46 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 65 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 56 billion 

  

at december 31 2004 the company’s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 79 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 40 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 139 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 40 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s derivative instruments would be approximately 22 million 

  

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to 

  

  

the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

  

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

business combinations

for the year ended december 31 2002 the company recorded approximately 171 million of asset impairment charges related to ech following the guidance in sfas no 142 these charges were the result of the company’s decision to reduce the carrying value of ech to 300 million given the continued weakness in the economy and management’s expectations for nearterm performance and were determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of the business this impairment loss is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations as impairment on corporate housing business and on the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in goodwill net 

  

competition 

  

all of the properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties and singlefamily housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties throughout 2002 and 2003 historically low mortgage interest rates coupled with increased residential construction and singlefamily home sales have had an adverse competitive effect on the company 

  

 

risk factors 

  

the following risk factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “we” and “us” refer to equity residential and its subsidiaries including erp operating limited partnership 

  

set forth below are the risks that we believe are important to investors who purchase or own our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference interests “interests” of a subsidiary of erp operating limited partnership preference units “units” or units of limited partnership interest “op units” of erp operating limited partnership our operating partnership which are redeemable on a oneforone basis for common shares or their cash equivalent in this section we refer to the shares interests units and the op units together as our “securities” and the investors who own shares interests units andor op units as our “security holders” 

  

our performance and share value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry   

general   

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties these factors include changes in the national regional and local economic climate local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes which could increase over time also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

  

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

  

when our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration we may not be able to relet their units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms because virtually all of our leases are for apartments they are generally for terms of no more than one year if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced as a result of general economic conditions and competitive factors discussed above we have experienced a trend of declining rents and increased concessions when entering into new leases across our portfolio during the last two years 

  

new acquisitions or developments may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

  

we intend to continue to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties newly acquired or developed properties may fail to perform as expected we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to develop a property additionally we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on 

  

  

favorable terms the total number of development units cost of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

  

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

  

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

  

changes in laws could affect our business 

  

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate taxes income taxes or other taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders similarly changes that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our securities 

  

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

  

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

over the past three years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties other than the company alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property 

  

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties 

  

 

insurance policy deductibles and exclusions 

  

in order to partially mitigate the substantial increase in insurance costs in recent years management has determined to gradually increase deductible and selfinsured retention amounts as of december 31 2003 the companys property insurance policy for wholly owned properties provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and self insured retention of 50 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate self insured retention of 75 million the company’s liability and worker’s compensation policies at december 31 2003 provide for a 10 million per occurrence deductible while higher deductible and selfinsured retention amounts expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses management believes that the savings in insurance premium expense justifies this increased exposure 

  

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 insurance carriers have created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” insurance policies while separate terrorism insurance coverage is available in certain instances premiums for such coverage are generally very expensive with very high deductibles moreover the terrorism insurance coverage that is available typically excludes coverage for losses from acts of foreign governments as well as nuclear biological and chemical attacks at the present time the company has determined that it is not economically prudent to obtain terrorism insurance for its portfolio to the extent otherwise available especially given the significant risks that are not covered by such insurance in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of the properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company believes however that the number and geographic diversity of its portfolio helps to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks 

  

debt financing preferred shares and preference interests and units could adversely affect our performance   

general 

  

the company’s total debt summary as of december 31 2003 included   

debt summary 

  

   

 net of the effect of any derivative instruments 

  

 

in addition to debt we have 9191 million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest and preference interests and units with a weighted average dividend preference of 817 per annum as of december 31 2003 our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

  

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

  

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

  

we may not be able to refinance existing debt which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties and may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us the company’s debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2003 is as follows 

  

debt maturity schedule 

  

 

  

1 includes 300 million of unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2015 that is putablecallable in 2005 

2 includes 150 million of unsecured debt with a final maturity of 2026 that is putable in 2006 

  

financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition 

  

if a property we own is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property resulting in loss of income and asset value foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations a foreclosure could also result in our recognition of taxable income without our actually receiving cash proceeds from the disposition of the property with which to pay the tax this could adversely affect our cash flow and could make it more difficult for us to meet our reit distribution requirements 

  

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain 

  

 

customary restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material indebtedness our unsecured public debt covenants as of december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively are terms are defined in the indentures 

  

unsecured public debt covenants 

  

   

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions we have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited 

  

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

  

our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 35 as of december 31 2003 we have a policy of incurring indebtedness for borrowed money only through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries and only if upon such incurrence our debt to market capitalization ratio would be approximately 50 or less our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general 

  

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

  

advances under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expenses under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders 

  

we depend on our key personnel 

  

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly bruce w duncan our president and chief executive officer and gerald a spector our chief operating officer if they resign our operations could be temporarily adversely 

  

 

effected mr zell has entered into executive compensation and retirement benefit agreements with the company mr duncan and mr spector have entered into deferred compensation agreements with the company that under certain conditions could provide both with a salary benefit after their respective termination of employment with the company in addition mr zell and mr spector have entered into noncompetition agreements with the company and mr duncan’s employment agreement contains covenants not to compete in favor of the company 

  

control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other shareholders 

  

as of january 31 2004 1 samuel zell the chairman of the board of the company and certain of the current holders of op units issued to affiliates of mr zell owned in the aggregate approximately 32 of our common shares mr zell and these affiliates are described herein as the “zell original owners” and 2 our executive officers and trustees excluding mr zell see disclosure above owned approximately 38 of our common shares these percentages assume all options are exercised for common shares and all op units are converted to common shares in addition the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the fifth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of erp operating limited partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the zell affiliates may have substantial influence over the company although these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company’s affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders 

  

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

  

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

  

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders this includes the 5 ownership limit described below see “we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes” also any future series of preferred shares of beneficial interest may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

  

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

  

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares 

  

 

our preferred shares of beneficial interest may affect changes in control 

  

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares of beneficial interest and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders as of december 31 2003 5496518 preferred shares were issued and outstanding 

  

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

  

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving the zell original owners and persons acting in concert with any of the zell original owners consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

  

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

  

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

  

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available 

  

 

for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders 

  

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reit’s 

  

if any of our recent merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at the time they were merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain in this event we would have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger finally we could be precluded from electing reit status for up to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for reit status 

  

other tax liabilities 

  

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition our thirdparty management operations corporate housing business and condominium conversion business which are conducted through subsidiaries generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

  

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

  

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

  

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

  

federal income tax considerations   

general 

  

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states 

  

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the 

  

 

application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

  

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

  

our taxation 

  

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive 

  

we will be subject however to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if certain rules enacted as part of the reit modernization act of 1999 are not complied with moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

  

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would be disqualified from qualification as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

  

tax legislation has recently been enacted which is intended to allow reits to have greater flexibility in engaging in activities which previously had been prohibited by the reit rules among these changes was the establishment of “taxable reit subsidiaries” or “trss” which are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation generally a taxable reit subsidiary can own assets that cannot be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible resident services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests in enacting the taxable reit subsidiary rules congress intended that the arrangements between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries be structured to ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation as a result the act imposes certain limits on the ability of a taxable reit 

  

 

subsidiary to deduct interest payments made to us in addition we will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by the taxable reit subsidiary if the economic arrangements between the reit the reit’s residents and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties 

  

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results 

  

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to help comply with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit

  

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests first at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments in real estate andor real estate mortgage dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments second at least 95 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of income qualifying under the 75 test and dividends nonreal estate mortgage interest some payments under hedging instruments and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions

  

asset tests  in general at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets 1 at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts and certain cash related items 2 not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class 3 except for equity investments in other reits qualified reit subsidiaries ie corporations owned 100 by a reit that are not trss or reits or taxable reit subsidiaries a the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and b we may not own more than 10 of the value of or the voting securities of any one issuer and 4 not more than 20 of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries securities for purposes of the asset tests may include debt securities we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed

  

 

as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service might not disagree with our determinations 

  

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed

  

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies

  

our management company and other subsidiaries  a small portion of the cash to be used by the operating partnership to fund distributions to us is expected to come from payments of dividends from management companies and other subsidiaries of the company that have elected trs status these companies pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates they will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes the cash available for distribution from these management companies by us to shareholders will be reduced accordingly

  

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax consequence discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares

  

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

  

general if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute “qualified dividends” under the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates applicable to qualified 

  

 

dividends paid to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares the portion of post 2002 ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs will be designated as qualified dividends to reit shareholders qualified dividends paid to noncorporate shareholders are eligible for preferential tax rates 

  

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent that such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of his shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

  

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital gains dividend as a 20 rate gain distribution premay 6 2003 15 rate gain distribution postmay 5 2003 and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution as the names suggest a 20 or 15 rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20 or 15 depending upon the timing of the capital gain to the reit an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

  

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

  

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

  

a   the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition and

  

b   the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares

  

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 

  

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be 

  

 

apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

  

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

  

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

  

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

  

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

  

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

  

taxation of foreign shareholders 

  

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

  

a   a citizen or resident of the united states

  

b   a corporation or partnership created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof or

  

c   an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of its source

  

distributions by us 

  

distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note 

  

 

that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reit’s dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

  

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

  

a   a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us or

b   the foreign shareholder files an irs form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income

  

a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

  

as a result of a legislative change made by the small business job protection act of 1996 we may be required to withhold 10 of any distribution in excess of our earnings and profits consequently although we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution to the extent that we do not do so distributions will be subject to withholding at a rate of 10 however a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

  

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax as discussed above or

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains

  

under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above we are required to withhold 35 

  

 

of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability 

  

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against the united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition foreign shareholders would be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

  

sales of common shares 

  

gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain or

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains

  

even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

  

a   the class or series of shares being sold is “regularly traded” as defined by applicable irs regulations on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange and

  

b   the selling foreign shareholder owned 5 or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or exchange

  

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price

 item 2 the properties 

  

as of december 31 2003 the company owned or had investments in 968 properties in 34 states consisting of 207506 units the company’s properties are more fully described as follows 

  

   

resident leases are generally for twelve months in length and typically require security deposits the gardenstyle properties are generally defined as properties with two andor three story buildings while the midrisehighrise are defined as properties with greater than three story buildings these two property types typically provide residents with amenities which may include a clubhouse swimming pool laundry facilities and cable television access certain of these properties offer additional amenities such as saunas whirlpools spas sports courts and exercise rooms or other amenities the ranchstyle properties are defined as single story properties which do not provide additional amenities for residents other than laundry facilities and cable television access the military housing properties are defined as those properties located on military bases 

  

it is management’s role to monitor compliance with property policies and to provide preventive maintenance of the properties including common areas facilities and amenities the company has a dedicated training and education department that creates and coordinates training and strategic implementation for the company’s property management personnel the company believes that due in part to its emphasis on training and employee quality the properties historically have had high occupancy rates 

  

the distribution of the properties throughout the united states reflects the company’s belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio from regional and economic influences at the same time the company has sought to create clusters of properties within each of its primary markets in order to achieve economies of scale in management and operation the company may nevertheless acquire additional multifamily properties located anywhere in the continental united states

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes the number of properties and related units for the periods presented 

  

   

properties that the company owned for all of both 2003 and 2002 the “2003 same store properties” which represented 171841 units impacted the company’s results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2002 and 2001 the “2002 same store properties” which represented 188027 units also impacted the company’s results of operations both the 2003 same store properties and 2002 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs 

  

the company’s acquisition disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 the impacts of these activities are also discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs 

  

comparison of the year ended december 31 2003 to the year ended december 31 2002 

  

for the year ended december 31 2003 income before allocation to minority interests income loss from investments in unconsolidated entities net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased by approximately 231 million when compared to the year ended december 31 2002 

  

revenues from the 2003 same store properties decreased primarily as a result of lower overall physical occupancy increased concessions and lower rental rates charged to both new and renewal residents property operating expenses from the 2003 same store properties increased primarily due to higher payroll maintenance utility real estate taxes insurance leasing and advertising and building costs the following tables provide comparative revenue expense net operating income “noi” and weighted average occupancy for the 2003 same store properties noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense real estate taxes and insurance expense and property management expense 

  

 

2003 vs 2002 

year over year samestore results 

 in millions – 171841 samestore units 

  

 

  

samestore occupancy statistics 

  

 

  

the company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is noi the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company’s apartment communities 

  

for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1 2003 and expects to continue to own through december 31 2004 the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31 2004 

  

2004 samestore assumptions 

  

 

  

these 2004 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

  

rental income from properties other than 2003 same store properties increased by approximately 475 million primarily as a result of revenue from newly acquired properties not yet included as 2003 same store properties and additional partially owned properties consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002 and during the year ended december 31 2003 

  

fee and asset management revenues net of fee and asset management expenses increased by 49 million primarily as a result of additional income allocated from ft lewis as of december 31 2003 and 2002 the company managed 18475 units and 18965 units respectively for third parties and unconsolidated entities 

  

property management expenses include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies these expenses decreased by approximately 44 million or 60 this decrease is primarily attributable to a reversal of a profit sharing accrual in the first quarter of 2003 related to the 2002 calendar year as the company didn’t achieve its stated goals and management elected not to make a discretionary contribution to the plan in addition the company recorded lower expense in connection with granting less restricted 

  

 

shares and reducing the expense associated with the company’s matched funding of its 401k plan during 2003 and not incurring an expense for 2003 discretionary profit sharing contributions 

  

depreciation expense which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased 253 million primarily as a result of properties acquired after december 31 2002 many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired and additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned 

  

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses decreased approximately 77 million between the periods under comparison this decrease was primarily due to lower expenses recorded in connection with granting less restricted shares to employees during 2003 partially offset by approximately a 26 million increase related to the company’s decision to begin to expense its stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 123 and its amendment sfas no 148 in addition lower state income and franchise taxes also contributed to this decrease

property management expenses include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties these expenses decreased by approximately 46 million or 59 this decrease is primarily attributable to lower amounts accrued for employee bonuses and profit sharing for 2002 and lower headcount in 2002 

  

depreciation expense which includes depreciation on nonreal estate assets increased 223 million primarily as a result of properties acquired after december 31 2001 many of which had significantly higher per unit acquisition costs than properties previously acquired and additional depreciation on capital expenditures for all properties owned 

  

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 111 million between the years under comparison this increase was primarily due to retirement plan expenses for certain key executives restricted sharesawards granted to key employees additional compensation charges and costs associated with the company’s new president higher state income taxes in michigan and new jersey and income taxes incurred by one of the company’s taxable reit subsidiaries which has an ownership interest in properties that in prior periods were classified as unconsolidated properties

interest and other income decreased by approximately 67 million primarily as a result of lower balances available for investment and related interest rates being earned on shortterm investment accounts along with lower balances on deposit in taxdeferred exchange accounts 

  

interest income – investment in mortgage notes decreased by 88 million as a result of the consolidation of previously unconsolidated properties in july 2001 no additional interest income will be recognized on such mortgage notes in future years as the company now consolidates the results related to these previously unconsolidated properties

income loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 75 million between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily the result of increased equity losses and unrealized losses on derivative instruments 

  

net gain on sales of discontinued operations decreased approximately 446 million between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily the result of the properties sold in 2001 having a lower net carrying value at sale which resulted in higher gain recognition for financial reporting purposes 

  

discontinued operations net increased approximately 485 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily attributable to a onetime 600 million impairment on the furniture rental business in 2001 which was subsequently sold in january 2002 see note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

derivative instruments 

  

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 

  

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 

  

see note 14 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31 2003 

  

 

other 

  

minority interests as of december 31 2003 decreased by 104 million when compared to december 31 2002 the primary factors that impacted this account in the company’s consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year ended december 31 2003 were

the company expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments generally through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions the company also expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities including additional op units and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties in addition the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit 

  

the company has a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to 7000 million this facility matures in may 2005 and may among other potential uses be used to fund property acquisitions costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements as of march 1 2004 2550 million was outstanding under this facility and 567 was restricted and dedicated to support letters of credit 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

the company has coinvested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the company’s liquidity capital resources credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities generally except to the extent the development ventures mitigate risk by deploying the skill and expertise of locally based real estate developers the nature and business purpose of these ventures are as follows 

  

•   institutional ventures – during 2000 and 2001 the company entered into ventures with an unaffiliated partner at the respective closing dates the company sold andor contributed 45 properties containing 10846 units to these ventures and retained a 25 ownership interest in the ventures the company’s joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75 of the agreedupon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures which was then distributed to the company the company’s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets

•   development ventures – since 1998 the company has generally engaged in development activities through various joint ventures with third party developers the company uses the local expertise of these developers and lowers the overall risks

  

  

associated with development by grouping various development properties into aggregate pools the company generally contributes between 25 and 35 of the development cost of these projects with the remaining cost financed through thirdparty construction mortgages voting rights are shared equally between the company and its respective development partners 

  

as of december 31 2003 the company has 13 projects in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through june 30 2005 the three development agreements currently in place have the following key terms 

  

•   the first development partner has the right at any time following completion of a project to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the company based on such value if the company chooses not to purchase the interest it must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value the company’s partner must exercise this right as to all projects within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property in connection with this development agreement the company has an obligation to provide up to 400 million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing as of february 4 2004 the company had setaside 200 million towards this credit enhancement the company would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party construction mortgage agreement this agreement expires no later than december 31 2018 notwithstanding the termination of the agreement the company shall have recourse against its development partner for any losses incurred

  

•   the second development partner has the right at any time following completion of a project to require the company to purchase the partners’ interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price if the company and the partner are unable to agree on a price both parties will obtain appraisals if the appraised values vary by more than 10 both the company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value the company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreedupon value to an unrelated third party five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property the company must purchase at the agreedupon price any projects remaining unsold

  

•   the third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization generally defined as having achieved 90 occupancy for three consecutive months following the substantial completion of a project to market a project for sale thereafter either the company or its development partner may market a project for sale if the company’s development partner proposes the sale the company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project if the two appraised values vary by more than 5 a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property once a value has been determined the company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreedupon value

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

the company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the six critical accounting policies are 

  

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

  

  the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate and goodwill for indicators of permanent impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions expected

  

  

holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

  

depreciation of investment in real estate 

  

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

  

cost capitalization 

  

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 

  

the company follows the guidance in sfas no 67 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of employees working directly at our properties except for costs that are incurred during the initial leaseup phase on a development project an allocated portion of payroll costs is capitalized based upon the occupancy of the project until stabilized occupancy is achieved the incremental payroll and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort directly identifiable with such projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as either construction in progress or a separate component of investments in unconsolidated entities the company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the property becomes substantially complete and ready for its intended use 

  

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

  

the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 107 and sfas no 133 and its amendments sfas nos 137138149 requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 

  

revenue recognition 

  

rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned which is not materially different than on a straightline basis leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally yeartoyear renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis interest income is recorded on an accrual basis 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

prior to 2003 the company had chosen to account for its stockbased compensation in accordance with apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  which resulted in no 

  

 

compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the company’s common shares on the date of grant intrinsic method the company has elected to account for its stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123 and its amendment sfas no 148 accounting for stock based compensation  effective in the first quarter of 2003 which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted 

  

sfas no 148 provides three transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 the company has chosen to use the “prospective method” this method requires that companies apply the recognition provisions of sfas no 123 to only employee awards granted or modified after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied or january 1 2003 compensation expense under all of the company’s plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years therefore the cost related to stockbased employee compensation included in the determination of net income for the year ended december 31 2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of sfas no 123 see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee awards 

  

funds from operations 

  

for the year ended december 31 2003 funds from operations “ffo” available to common shares and op units decreased 789 million or 110 as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 for the year ended december 31 2002 ffo available to common shares and op units increased 130 million or 18 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and op units for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

funds from operations 

amounts in thousands 

  

   

 

1   the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines funds from operations “ffo” april 2002 white paper as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from sales of property plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis the april 2002 white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only once the company commences the conversion of units to condominiums it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property accordingly the company included in ffo its incremental gains or losses from the sale of condominium units to third parties which represented net gains of 10280 1682 and 0 for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively effective january 1 2003 the company no longer adds back impairment losses when computing ffo in accordance with nareit’s definition as a result ffo for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 have been reduced by 18284 71766 and 1000 respectively to conform to the current year presentation for the year ended december 31 2001 ffo has been reduced by 5324 to reflect the sec’s clarification of eitf topic d42 regarding premiums on redemption of preferred shares 

  

2   the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures ffo in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore ffo should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity the company’s calculation of ffo may differ from other real estate companies due to among other items variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and accordingly may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

market risks relating to the company’s operations result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 

  

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured line of credit the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 

  

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 14 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

  

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets lines of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses rents received in advance and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the 

  

 

company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at december 31 2003 

  

the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 7500 million or 140 of total debt at december 31 2003 net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 22 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 17 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 22 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 17 million 

  

at december 31 2003 the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately 46 billion net of the effects of any derivative instruments if market rates of interest permanently increased by 67 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 42 billion if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 67 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt would be approximately 51 billion 

  

at december 31 2003 the company’s consolidated derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 39 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 25 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net asset fair value of the company’s consolidated derivative instruments would be approximately 80 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 25 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s consolidated derivative instruments would be approximately 01 million

  

at december 31 2003 the company’s unconsolidated derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately 52 million if market rates of interest permanently increased by 11 basis points a 10 increase from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s unconsolidated derivative instruments would be approximately 51 million if market rates of interest permanently decreased by 11 basis points a 10 decrease from the company’s existing weighted average interest rates the net liability fair value of the company’s unconsolidated derivative instruments would be approximately 53 million

  

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of changes of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results 

  

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

general 

  

equity residential “eqr” formed in march 1993 is a fully integrated real estate company engaged in the acquisition ownership management and operation of multifamily properties eqr has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” 

  

eqr is the general partner of and as of december 31 2002 owned an approximate 924 ownership interest in erp operating limited partnership an illinois limited partnership the “operating partnership” the operating partnership is directly or indirectly a partner member or shareholder of numerous partnerships limited liability companies and corporations which have been established primarily to own fee simple title to multifamily properties or to conduct property management activities and other businesses related to the ownership and operation of multifamily residential real estate references to the “company” include eqr the operating partnership and each of the partnerships limited liability companies and corporations controlled by the operating partnership or eqr 

  

as of december 31 2002 the company owned or had investments in 1039 properties in 36 states consisting of 223591 units an ownership breakdown includes 

  

   

the “wholly owned properties” are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting the company beneficially owns 100 fee simple title to 912 of the 919 wholly owned properties the company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under a longterm ground lease that expires in 2066 for one property this one property is consolidated and reflected as a real estate asset while the ground lease is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 13 accounting for leases   the company owns the debt collateralized by two properties and owns an interest in the debt collateralized by the remaining four properties the company consolidates its interest in these six properties in accordance with the accounting standards outlined in the acsec guidance for real estate acquisition development and construction arrangements issued in the cpa letter dated february 10 1986 and as such reflects these assets as real estate in the consolidated financial statements 

  

the “partially owned properties” are controlled and partially owned by the company but have partners with minority interests and are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting the “unconsolidated properties” are partially owned but not controlled by the company with the exception of one property the unconsolidated properties consist of investments in partnership interests andor subordinated mortgages that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting the remaining one property consists of an investment in a limited liability company that as a result of the terms of the operating agreement is accounted for as a management contract right with all fees recognized as fee and asset management revenue the above table does not include various uncompleted development properties see item 2 “properties – development projects” 

  

the company is one of the largest publicly traded reit’s based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding common shares and is the largest publicly traded reit owner of multifamily properties based on the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned the company’s 

  

  

corporate headquarters are located in chicago illinois and the company also leases under operating leases over thirtyfive divisional regional and area property management offices throughout the united states 

  

direct fee simple title for certain of the properties is owned by singlepurpose nominee corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or land trusts that engage in no business other than holding title to the property for the benefit of the company holding title in such a manner is expected to make it less costly to transfer such property in the future in the event of a sale and should facilitate financing since lenders often require title to a property to be held in a single purpose entity in order to isolate that property from potential liabilities of other properties 

  

the company has approximately 6400 employees as of march 1 2003 an onsite manager who supervises the onsite employees and is responsible for the daytoday operations of the property directs each of the company’s properties an assistant manager andor leasing staff generally assist the manager in addition a maintenance director at each property supervises a maintenance staff whose responsibilities include a variety of tasks including responding to service requests preparing vacant apartments for the next resident and performing preventive maintenance procedures yearround

business objectives and operating strategies 

  

the company seeks to maximize both current income and longterm growth in income thereby increasing 

  

•   the value of the properties 

•   distributions on a per common share basis and 

•   shareholders’ value 

  

the company’s strategies for accomplishing these objectives are 

  

•   maintaining and increasing property occupancy while increasing rental rates 

•   controlling expenses providing regular preventive maintenance making periodic renovations and enhancing amenities 

•   maintaining a ratio of consolidated debttototal market capitalization of less than 50 

•   strategically acquiring and disposing of properties with an emphasis on acquiring attractive properties in high barrier to entry markets and on selling properties in low barrier to entry markets 

•   purchasing newly developed as well as coinvesting in the development of multifamily communities 

•   entering into joint ventures related to the ownership of established properties and 

•   strategically investing in various businesses that will enhance services for the properties 

  

the company is committed to resident satisfaction by striving to anticipate industry trends and implementing strategies and policies consistent with providing quality resident services in addition the company continuously surveys rental rates of competing properties and conducts resident satisfaction surveys to determine the factors they consider most important in choosing a particular apartment unit andor property 

  

acquisition and development strategies 

  

the company anticipates that future property acquisitions and developments will occur within the united states management will continue to use market information to evaluate opportunities the company’s market database allows it to review the primary economic indicators of the markets where the company currently owns properties and where it expects to expand its operations acquisitions and 

  

  

developments may be financed from various sources of capital which may include retained cash flow issuance of additional equity and debt securities sales of properties joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings in addition the company may acquire additional properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership “op units” as consideration for the acquired properties such transactions may in certain circumstances enable the sellers to defer in part the recognition of taxable income or gain which might otherwise result from the sales 

  

when evaluating potential acquisitions and developments the company will consider 

  

•   the geographic area and type of community 

•   the location construction quality condition and design of the property 

•   the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow 

•   the potential for capital appreciation of the property 

•   the terms of resident leases including the potential for rent increases 

•   income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market

•   employment and household growth and net migration of the relevant market’s population

•   the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located 

•   the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity the overall market and submarket 

•   the prospects for liquidity through sale financing or refinancing of the property 

•   the benefits of integration into existing operations 

•   barriers to entry that would limit competition zoning laws building permit availability supply of undeveloped or developable real estate local building costs and construction labor costs among other factors

•   purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized communities if any and

•   competition from existing multifamily properties residential properties under development and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area 

  

disposition strategies 

  

management uses market information to evaluate dispositions factors the company considers in deciding whether to dispose of its properties include the following 

  

•   potential increases in new construction 

•   submarkets that will underperform the average performance of the portfolio in the mid and longterm 

•   markets where the company does not intend to establish longterm concentrations and 

•   age or location of a particular property 

  

the company will reinvest the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to fund property acquisitions as well as fund development activities in addition when feasible the company may structure these transactions as tax deferred exchanges

competition 

  

all of the properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company’s ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company’s managers in addition other forms of rental properties including multifamily properties and manufactured housing some of which may be controlled by mr zell and singlefamily housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties recently historically low mortgage interest rates coupled with record residential construction and singlefamily home sales have had an adverse competitive effect on the company 

  

risk factors 

  

the following risk factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report unless otherwise indicated when used in this section the terms “we” and “us” refer to equity residential and its subsidiaries including erp operating limited partnership 

  

set forth below are the risks that we believe are important to investors who purchase or own our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as “shares” preference interests “interests” of a subsidiary of erp operating limited partnership preference units “units” or units of limited partnership interest “op units” of erp operating limited partnership our operating partnership which are redeemable on a oneforone basis for common shares or their cash equivalent in this section we refer to the shares interests units and the op units together as our “securities” and the investors who own shares interests units andor op units as our “security holders” 

  

our performance and share value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry   general   real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties these factors include changes in the national regional and local economic climate local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to residents competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes which could increase over time also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 

  

  

we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 

  

when our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration we may not be able to relet their units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms because virtually all of our leases are for apartments they are generally for terms of no more than one year if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected consequently our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced as a result of general economic conditions and competitive factors discussed above we have experienced a trend of declining rents and increased concessions when entering into new leases across our portfolio during 2002 

  

new acquisitions or developments may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

  

we intend to continue to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties newly acquired or developed properties may fail to perform as expected we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to develop a property additionally we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms the total number of development units cost of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials competition and local government regulation 

  

because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 

  

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

  

changes in laws could affect our business 

  

we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate taxes income taxes or other taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders similarly changes that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our securities 

  

environmental problems are possible and can be costly 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 

  

  

environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestos these laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

over the past two years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties other than the company alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property 

  

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties 

  

insurance policy deductibles and exclusions 

  

  in order to partially mitigate the substantial increase in insurance costs in recent years management has determined to gradually increase deductible and self insured retention amounts as of december 31 2002 the company property insurance policy for wholly owned properties provides for a per occurrence deductible of 250000 and self insured retention of 1 million per occurrence subject to a maximum annual aggregate self insured retention of 4 million the companys liability and workers compensation policies at december 31 2002 provide for a 1 million per occurrence deductible while higher deductible and self insured retention amounts expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses management believes that the savings in insurance premium expense justifies this increased exposure management anticipates that deductibles and self insured retention amounts will likely further increase for 2003 policy renewals 

  

as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 insurance carriers have created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our “all risk” insurance policies while separate terrorism insurance coverage is available in certain instances premiums for such coverage is generally very expensive with very high deductibles moreover the terrorism insurance coverage that is available typically excludes coverage for losses from acts of foreign governments as well as nuclear biological and chemical attacks the company has determined that it is not economically prudent to obtain terrorism insurance to the extent otherwise available especially given the significant risks that are not covered by such insurance in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of the properties we could lose the revenues from the property our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses the company believes however that the number and geographic diversity of its portfolio helps to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks 

  

debt financing preferred shares and preference interests and units could adversely affect our performance   general 

  

the company’s total debt summary as of december 31 2002 included

 net of the effect of any interest rate protection agreements 

  

in addition to debt we have issued 12 billion of combined liquidation value for the preferred shares of beneficial interest and preference interests and units with a weighted average dividend preference of 807 per annum our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks including the following 

  

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 

  

in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 

  

we may not be able to refinance existing debt which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions such as new equity capital our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt as a result we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties and may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us the company’s debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2002 is as follows 

  

debt maturity schedule as of december 31 2002 

  

 

  

 includes 300 million with a final maturity of 2015 that is putablecallable in 2005 and 140 million related to the company’s unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

  

financial covenants could adversely affect the company’s financial condition 

  

if a property we own is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property resulting in loss of income and asset value foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations a foreclosure could also result in our recognition of taxable income without our actually receiving cash proceeds from the disposition of the property with which to pay the tax this could adversely affect our cash flow and could make it more difficult for us to meet our reit distribution requirements 

  

the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage in addition our unsecured credit facilities contain certain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness including acquisition financing and to sell all or substantially all of our assets our credit facility and indentures are crossdefaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material indebtedness our unsecured public debt covenants as of december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively are terms are defined in the indentures 

  

unsecured public debt covenants 

  

 

  

some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions we have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or moderateincome residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited 

  

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 

  

our consolidated debttototal market capitalization ratio was 398 as of december 31 2002 we have a policy of incurring indebtedness for borrowed money only through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries and only if upon such incurrence our debt to market capitalization 

  

  

ratio would be approximately 50 or less our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally 

  

rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 

  

advances under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership’s credit rating or based upon bids received from the lending group certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expenses under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders 

  

we depend on our key personnel 

  

we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees samuel zell and our executive officers particularly bruce w duncan our president and chief executive officer “ceo” and gerald a spector our chief operating officer if they resign our operations could be temporarily adversely effected mr zell has entered into executive compensation and retirement benefit agreements with the company mr duncan and mr spector have entered into deferred compensation agreements with the company that under certain conditions could provide both with a salary benefit after their respective termination of employment with the company in addition mr zell and mr spector have entered into noncompetition agreements with the company and mr duncan’s employment agreement contains covenants not to compete in favor of the company douglas crocker ii our former ceo retired effective january 1 2003 

  

control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other shareholders 

  

as of january 31 2003 1 samuel zell the chairman of the board of the company and certain of the current holders of op units issued to affiliates of mr zell owned in the aggregate approximately 31 of our common shares mr zell and these affiliates are described herein as the “zell original owners” and 2 our executive officers and trustees excluding mr zell see disclosure above owned approximately 50 of our common shares these percentages assume all options are exercised for common shares and all op units are converted to common shares in addition the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is required for certain amendments to the fifth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of erp operating limited partnership the “partnership agreement” as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement the zell affiliates may have substantial influence over the company although these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company’s affairs if they were to act together in the future this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders 

  

shareholders’ ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited 

  

provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control 

  

certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders these include a staggered board of trustees and the 5 ownership limit described below see “—we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes” also any future series of preferred shares of beneficial interest may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 

  

we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes 

  

to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares we refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit” absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a 

  

  

designated charitable beneficiary and the security holder’s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security holders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares 

  

our preferred shares of beneficial interest may affect changes in control 

  

our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares of beneficial interest and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders as of december 31 2002 10524034 preferred shares were issued and outstanding 

  

inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control 

  

certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit “business combinations” including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the trust’s outstanding voting securities an “interested shareholder” or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving the zell original owners and persons acting in concert with any of the zell original owners consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us andor any of them such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 

  

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 

  

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders 

  

we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 based in part upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit the 

  

  

determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we fail to qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders 

  

we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reit’s 

  

if any of our recent merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we might not qualify as a reit we believe based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations among other things that each of our merger partners qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any undistributed “c corporation earnings and profits” at the time of their merger with us if any of our merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at the time they were merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such gain in this event we would have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger finally we could be precluded from electing reit status for up to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for reit status 

  

other tax liabilities 

  

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property in addition our thirdparty management operations corporate housing business and condominium conversion business which are conducted through subsidiaries generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

  

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition 

  

distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company 

  

we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 

  

  

federal income tax considerations 

  

general 

  

the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states 

  

the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder’s personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 

  

the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations the legislative history of the internal revenue code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings which are not binding on the internal revenue service and existing court decisions future legislation regulations administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law any change could apply retroactively thus it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

  

our taxation 

  

we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive 

  

we will be subject however to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements we could also be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference in addition any net income from “prohibited transactions” ie dispositions of property other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a 100 tax we could also be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if certain rules enacted as part of the reit modernization act of 1999 are not complied with moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 

  

we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit however given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 

  

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we also may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory relief we would be disqualified from qualification as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 

  

tax legislation has recently been enacted which is intended to allow reits to have greater flexibility in engaging in activities which previously had been prohibited by the reit rules among these changes was the establishment of “taxable reit subsidiaries” or “trss” which are corporations subject to tax as a regular “c” corporation generally a taxable reit subsidiary can own assets that cannot be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible resident services discussed below which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests in enacting the taxable reit subsidiary rules congress intended that the arrangements between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries be structured to ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation as a result the act imposes certain limits on the ability of a taxable reit subsidiary to deduct interest payments made to us in addition we will be obligated to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by the taxable reit subsidiary if the economic arrangements between the reit the reit’s residents and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties 

  

our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results 

  

share ownership test and organizational requirement  in order to qualify as a reit our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months also not more than 50 in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year in addition we must meet certain other organizational requirements including but not limited to that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future in order to help comply with the 100 person test and the 50 share ownership test discussed above we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership however such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements and thereby failing to qualify as a reit

  

gross income tests  to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income tests first at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments in real estate andor real estate mortgage dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments second at least 95 of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of income qualifying under the 75 test and dividends nonreal estate mortgage interest some payments under hedging instruments and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident also the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15 of the total rent we may generally provide services to residents without “tainting” our rental income only if such services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “impermissible services” if such services are impermissible then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a taxable reit subsidiary we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible or if considered impermissible services will

  

  

meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 

  

asset tests  in general at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets 1 at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts and certain cash related items 2 not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class 3 except for equity investments in other reits qualified reit subsidiaries ie corporations owned 100 by a reit that are not trss or reits or taxable reit subsidiaries a the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and b we may not own more than 10 of the value of or the voting securities of any one issuer and 4 not more than 20 of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries securities for purposes of the asset tests may include debt securities we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit we would not meet the 10 voting stock limitation and the 10 value limitation and we would fail to qualify as a reit we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification however we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service might not disagree with our determinations

  

annual distribution requirements  to qualify as a reit we are generally required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90 95 for taxable years prior to 2001 of our reit taxable income these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as adjusted we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for the year and 3 any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains in that case a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as longterm capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit for purposes of the 4 excise tax described above any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed

  

ownership of partnership interests by us  as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership respectively for purposes of the reit asset and income tests including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies provided that the operating partnership is taxed as a partnership and not as a “c” corporation for federal tax purposes under the internal revenue code publicly traded partnerships are generally taxed as “c” corporations unless at least 90 of their gross income consists of “qualifying income” such as interest dividends real property rents and gains from the sale or other disposition of real property held for investment the operating partnership is treated as a publicly traded partnership however it satisfies the 90 qualifying income test if the operating partnership did not satisfy the qualifying income test then it would be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes which would jeopardize our status as a reit a partnership is a “publicly traded partnership” if interests in such partnership are either traded on an established securities market or are “readily tradable on a secondary market” and there are at least 500 partners at any time during the taxable year we believe that all other partnerships in which we own an interest are not publicly traded partnerships

  

our management company and other subsidiaries  a small portion of the cash to be used by the

  

  

operating partnership to fund distributions to us is expected to come from payments of dividends from management companies and other subsidiaries of the company that have elected trs status these companies pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates they will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes the cash available for distribution from these management companies by us to shareholders will be reduced accordingly 

  

state and local taxes  we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business or reside our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax consequence discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares

  

taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax 

  

general if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital gain distributions will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares 

  

to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a taxfree distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder’s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent that such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder’s tax basis such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of his shares shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 

  

distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital gains dividend as a 20 rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution as the names suggest a 20 rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20 an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25 

  

if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 

  

in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 

  

a   the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition and

  

  

b   the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares

  

the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year the taxpayer relief act of 1997 allows the irs to issue regulations that would apply a capital gains tax rate of 25 to a portion of the capital gain realized by a noncorporate holder of reit shares the irs has not issued these regulations however if the irs does issue these regulations they could affect the taxation of gain and loss realized on the disposition of common shares shareholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the impact of such rules on their capital gains tax 

  

in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less determined after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 

  

we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 

  

taxation of domestic taxexempt shareholders 

  

most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 

  

however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 

  

in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a “pensionheld reit” must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes of this rule 

  

taxation of foreign shareholders 

  

the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder for purposes of this discussion a “foreign shareholder” is any person other than 

  

a   a citizen or resident of the united states

  

b   a corporation or partnership created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the

  

  

united states or of any state thereof or 

  

c   an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of its source

distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reit’s dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate 

  

we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless 

  

a   a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us or

  

b   the foreign shareholder files an irs form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income

  

a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s common shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder’s common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below 

  

as a result of a legislative change made by the small business job protection act of 1996 we may be required to withhold 10 of any distribution in excess of our earnings and profits consequently although we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty rate on the entire amount of any distribution to the extent that we do not do so distributions will be subject to withholding at a rate of 10 however a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder’s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 

  

distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax as discussed above or

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains

  

  

under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above we are required to withhold 35 of these distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder’s united states federal income tax liability 

  

although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against the united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains in addition foreign shareholders would be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

  

sales of common shares 

  

gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax if either 

  

a   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder’s united states trade or business in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain or

  

b   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 tax on the individual’s capital gains

  

even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if 

  

a   the class or series of shares being sold is “regularly traded” as defined by applicable irs regulations on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange and

  

b   the selling foreign shareholder owned 5 or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or exchange

  

if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner 

  

  

as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes the number of properties and related units for the periods presented 

  

   

the company’s acquisition and disposition activity has impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 significant changes in revenues and expenses have resulted primarily from the consolidation of previously unconsolidated properties in july 2001 and the fourth quarter of 2002 the disposition of the furniture rental business on january 11 2002 reduced rental income through increased concessions or reduced apartment rents and occupancy at many of our properties and the properties acquired and developments completed in 2001 and 2002 which have been partially offset by the properties disposed in 2001 and 2002 significant changes in expenses have also resulted from changes in insurance costs general and administrative costs impairment charges and variable interest rates this impact is discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs 

  

properties that the company owned for all of both 2002 and 2001 the “2002 same store properties” which represented 188027 units impacted the company’s results of operations properties that the company owned for all of both 2001 and 2000 the “2001 same store properties” which represented 181951 units also impacted the company’s results of operations both the 2002 same store properties and 2001 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs

revenues from the 2002 same store properties decreased primarily as a result of lower overall physical occupancy increased concessions and lower rental rates charged to both new and renewal residents property operating expenses from the 2002 same store properties which include property and maintenance 

  

  

real estate taxes and insurance and an allocation of property management expenses remained relatively stable with increases in real estate taxes and insurance costs offset by a decrease in utility costs the following tables provide comparative revenue expense net operating income “noi” and weighted average occupancy for the 2002 same store properties

2003 same store operating assumptions 

  

 

  

these 2003 operating assumptions are based on current expectations and are forwardlooking 

  

rental income from properties other than 2002 same store properties increased by approximately 159 million primarily as a result of revenue from properties acquired in 2001 and 2002 and additional partially owned properties consolidated in 2001 and the fourth quarter of 2002 

  

interest and other income decreased by approximately 70 million primarily as a result of lower balances available for investment and related interest rates being earned on shortterm investment accounts along with lower balances on deposit in taxdeferred exchange accounts 

  

interest income – investment in mortgage notes decreased by 88 million as a result of the consolidation of previously unconsolidated properties in july 2001 no additional interest income will be recognized on such mortgage notes in future years as the company now consolidates the results related to these previously unconsolidated properties see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

property management expenses include offsite expenses associated with the selfmanagement of the company’s properties these expenses decreased by approximately 50 million or 65 this decrease is 

  

  

primarily attributable to lower amounts accrued for employee bonuses and profit sharing for 2002 and lower headcount in 2002

general and administrative expenses which include corporate operating expenses increased approximately 111 million between the years under comparison this increase was primarily due to retirement plan expenses for certain key executives restricted sharesawards granted to key employees additional compensation charges and costs associated with the company’s new president higher state income taxes in michigan and new jersey and income taxes incurred by one of the company’s taxable reit subsidiaries which has an ownership interest in properties that in prior periods were classified as unconsolidated properties 

  

income loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately 75 million between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily the result of increased equity losses and unrealized losses on derivative instruments 

  

net gain on sales of discontinued operations decreased approximately 446 million between the periods under comparison this decrease is primarily the result of the properties sold in 2001 having a lower net carrying value at sale which resulted in higher gain recognition for financial reporting purposes 

  

discontinued operations net increased approximately 530 million between the periods under comparison this increase is primarily attributable to a onetime 600 million impairment on the furniture rental business in 2001 which was subsequently sold in january 2002 see note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

improvements to real estate and additions to nonreal estate property for both 2002 and 2001 were funded from net cash provided by operating activities 

  

derivative instruments 

  

in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes the company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 

  

the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 

  

the following table summarizes the consolidated derivative instruments at december 31 2002 dollar amounts are in thousands 

  

   

at december 31 2002 certain unconsolidated development partnerships in which the company invested had entered into swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on unconsolidated floating rate construction mortgage loans the company has recorded its proportionate share of these hedges on its consolidated balance sheets these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with a current aggregate notional amount of 4466 million notional amounts range from 1692 million to 5559 million over the terms of the swaps at interest rates ranging from 2115 to 694 maturing at various 

  

  

dates ranging from 2003 to 2005 with a net liability fair value of 139 million during the year ended december 31 2002 the company recognized an unrealized loss of 11 million due to ineffectiveness of certain of these unconsolidated development derivatives included in income loss from investments in unconsolidated entities 

  

on december 31 2002 the net derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other liabilities of approximately 166 million and as a reduction to investments in unconsolidated entities of approximately 139 million as of december 31 2002 there were approximately 428 million in deferred losses net included in accumulated other comprehensive loss based on the estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments at december 31 2002 the company may recognize an estimated 177 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the twelve months ending december 31 2003 of which 79 million is related to the unconsolidated development partnerships 

  

other 

  

minority interests as of december 31 2002 decreased by 245 million when compared to december 31 2001 the primary factors that impacted this account in the company’s consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year were 

  

•   distributions declared to minority interests which amounted to 391 million for 2002 excluding junior preference unit and preference interest distributions

•   the allocation of income from operations to holders of op units in the amount of 269 million

•   the allocation of income from operations to partially owned properties in the amount of 19 million

•   the conversion of op units into common shares and

•   the issuance of common shares and op units during 2002

  

total distributions paid in january 2003 amounted to 1431 million excluding distributions on partially owned properties which included certain distributions declared in the fourth quarter of 2002 

  

the company expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments generally through its working capital net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions the company also expects to meet its longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities property acquisitions financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities including additional op units and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties in addition the company has certain unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high the fair value of these unencumbered properties are in excess of the required value the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit 

  

on may 30 2002 the company obtained a new threeyear 7000 million unsecured revolving credit facility the new line of credit replaced the 7000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in august 2002 the prior existing revolving credit facility was terminated upon the closing of the new facility this new facility matures in may 2005 and will be used to fund property acquisitions costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements as of february 3 2003 2180 million was outstanding under this new facility 

  

for the year ended december 31 2001 

  

as of january 1 2001 the company had approximately 238 million of cash and cash equivalents

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

the company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented the six critical accounting policies are 

  

impairment of longlived assets including goodwill 

  

the company periodically evaluates its longlived assets including its investments in real estate and goodwill for impairment indicators the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance market conditions expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 

  

depreciation of investment in real estate 

  

the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30year estimated useful life building improvements over a 5year to 10year estimated useful life and both the furniture fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5year estimated useful life all of which are judgmental determinations 

  

cost capitalization 

  

see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs expensing of fixed assetrepair and maintenance costs in addition the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to building 

  

  

the company follows the guidance in sfas no 67 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred the company capitalizes interest real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of employees working directly at our properties except for costs that are incurred during the initial leaseup phase on a development project an allocated portion of payroll costs is capitalized based upon the occupancy of the project until stabilized occupancy is achieved stabilized occupancy is always deemed to have occurred no later than one year from cessation of major development activities the incremental payroll and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort directly identifiable with such projects these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as either construction in progress or a separate component of investments in unconsolidated entities the company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the property becomes substantially complete and ready for its intended use 

  

fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments 

  

the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 107 and sfas no 133 and its amendments sfas nos 137 and 138 requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments the company where possible bases the fair values of its financial instruments including its derivative instruments on listed market prices and third party quotes where these are not available the company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 

  

revenue recognition 

  

rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned which is not materially different than on a straightline basis interest income is recorded on an accrual basis leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally yeartoyear renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis 

  

the company adopted the provisions of staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 revenue recognition  effective october 1 2000 sab no 101 provides guidance on the recognition presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 

  

stock option compensation 

  

the company has chosen to account for its stock option compensation in accordance with apb no 25 which results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the company’s common shares on the date of grant the company will elect to expense its stock option compensation in accordance with sfas no 123 and its amendment sfas no 148 effective in the first quarter of 2003 which will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock option compensation issued 

  

funds from operations 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 funds from operations “ffo” available to common shares and op units decreased 484 million or 61 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 for the year ended december 31 2001 ffo available to common shares and op units increased 605 million or 83 as compared to the year ended december 31 2000 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common shares to ffo available to common shares and op units for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

  

funds from operations 

amounts in thousands 

  

   

1   ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” plus depreciation after adjustments for nonreal estate additions partially owned properties and unconsolidated properties plus amortization of goodwill and plusminus extraordinary items the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and impairment charges adjustments also include net gain on sales of condominium units to third parties and net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities and for discontinued operations related to depreciation goodwill amortization impairment on furniture rental business and net gain on sales 

  

the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because along with cash flows from operating activities financing activities and investing activities it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures ffo in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company’s performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs the company’s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other real estate companies and may differ for example due to variations among the company’s and other real estate companies’ accounting policies for replacement type items and accordingly may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

market risks relating to the company’s operations result primarily from changes in shortterm libor interest rates the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 

  

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured line of credit the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing longterm fixed rate financing the 

  

  

company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 

  

the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes see also note 14 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

  

the fair values of the company’s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents other assets lines of credit accounts payable and accrued expenses rents received in advance and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates the fair value of the company’s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at december 31 2002 

  

the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately 7480 million or 135 of total debt at december 31 2002 including the effects of any interest rate protection agreements if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by 23 basis points a 10 increase the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 17 million if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by 23 basis points a 10 decrease the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 17 million 

  

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company’s financial instruments the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company’s floating rate debt and does not differentiate among maturities these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis assumes no changes in the company’s financial structure or results other than interest expense 

  

the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and therefore its exposure to market risk nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing consequently future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

         in addition to debt we have issued preferred shares of beneficial
interest our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain
risks including the following

         scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition

         in the future our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required
payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities
at expected levels we may not be able to refinance existing debt which in
virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and
if we can the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the
terms of existing indebtedness if principal payments due at maturity cannot
be refinanced extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions
such as new equity capital our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years
to repay all maturing debt as a result we may be forced to postpone capital
expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties and may have to
dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be
unacceptable to us

         financial covenants could adversely affect the companys financial
         condition

         if a property we own is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness
and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments the holder of the mortgage
could foreclose on the property resulting in loss of income and asset value
foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing
indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition
and results of operations a foreclosure could also result in our recognition
of taxable income without our actually receiving cash proceeds from the
disposition of the property with which to pay the tax this could adversely
affect our cash flow and could make it more difficult for us to meet our
distribution requirements as a real estate investment trust a reit

         the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative
covenants that among other things limit our ability without the prior
consent of the lender to further mortgage the property and to discontinue
insurance coverage in addition our credit facilities contain certain
customary restrictions

                                      13

requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness the
indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain
certain financial and operating covenants including among other things
maintenance of certain financial ratios as well as limitations on our
ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness including acquisition
financing sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in
mergers consolidations and certain acquisitions accordingly in the event
that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of
these restrictions our ability to acquire additional properties may be
limited if we are unable to acquire additional properties our ability to
increase the distributions to security holders as we have done in the past
will be limited to managements ability to increase funds from operations
and thereby cash available for distributions from the existing properties in
our portfolio at such time

         some of the properties were financed with taxexempt bonds that
contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions we have retained
an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive
covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties if these bond
compliance requirements require us to lower our rental rates to attract low
or moderate income tenants or eligiblequalified tenants then our income
from these properties may be limited

         our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional
         financing

         our debt to market capitalization ratio total debt as a percentage
of total debt plus the market value of the outstanding common and preferred
shares and units was approximately 378 as of december 31 2000 we have a
policy of incurring indebtedness for borrowed money only through the
operating partnership and its subsidiaries and only if upon such incurrence
our debt to market capitalization ratio would be approximately 50 or less
our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders
for example the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain
additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures
acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes making us more
vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally

         rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow

         advances under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates
based upon libor available at various interest periods plus a certain spread
dependent upon the companys credit rating certain of our senior unsecured
debt instruments also from time to time bear interest at floating rates we
may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expenses under these
debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing
indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates
would adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to
make distributions to security holders

control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a
manner adverse to other shareholders

         general

         as of february 1 2001 1 samuel zell and certain of the current
holders of units issued to affiliates of mr zell who contributed 33
properties to the company at the time of our initial public offering owned
in the aggregate approximately 27 of our common shares mr zell and these
affiliates are described herein as the zell original owners and 2 our
executive officers and trustees excluding mr zell see disclosure above
owned approximately 47 of our common shares these percentages assume all
options are exercised for common shares and all units are converted to common
shares in addition the consent of certain affiliates of mr zell is
required for certain amendments to the fifth amended and restated erp
operating limited partnership agreement of limited partnership the

partnership agreement as a result of their security ownership and rights
concerning amendments to the partnership agreement mr zell may have
substantial influence over the company although these security holders have
not agreed to act together on any matter they would be in a position to
exercise even more influence over the companys affairs if they were to act
together in the future this influence might be exercised in a manner that is
inconsistent with the interests of other security holders

         mr zell and others are exempt from the 5 ownership limit generally
         applicable to securities holders

         in order to maintain its qualification as a reit under the internal
revenue code of 1986 as amended the code not more than 50 of the value
of the outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or
fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities to
assure compliance with this test our declaration of trust restricts the
ownership of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value of the
outstanding shares by any single security holder subject to certain
exceptions these restrictions do not apply to the ownership of common shares
that may be acquired by the holders of units issued to the zell original
owners and the starwood owners additionally our declaration of trust
exempts any transferees of such common shares from the 5 ownership limit
provided such transfers do not result in an increased concentration in the
ownership

environmental problems are possible and can be costly

         federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or
operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic
substances or petroleum product releases at such property the owner or
operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property
damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in
connection with the contamination these laws typically impose cleanup
responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator
knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one
person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by
the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs
incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site
for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating
from that site

         environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal
of asbestos these laws require that owners or operators of buildings
containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they
notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they
undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement if
asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who
fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek
recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with
exposure to asbestos fibers

         substantially all of our properties have been the subject of
environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental
consultant companies these environmental assessments have not revealed nor
are we aware of any environmental liability that our management believes
would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations
financial condition or liquidity

         we cannot assure you that existing environmental assessments of our
properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any
of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known
to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as
to any one or more of our properties

our performance and share value are subject to risks associated with the real
estate industry

                                       15

page

         general

         real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and
are relatively illiquid several factors may adversely affect the economic
performance and value of our properties these factors include changes in the
national regional and local economic climate local conditions such as an
oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our
multifamily properties the attractiveness of our properties to tenants
competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in
market rental rates our performance also depends on our ability to collect
rent from tenants and to pay for adequate maintenance insurance and other
operating costs including real estate taxes which could increase over time
also the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily
reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a
reduction in income from the property

         we may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire

         when our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon expiration
we may not be able to relet their space even if the tenants do renew or we
can relet the space the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable
than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or
relet the space or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are
significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and
financial condition will be adversely affected consequently our cash flow
and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would
be reduced

         new acquisitions or developments may fail to perform as expected and
         competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for
         properties

         we intend to continue to actively acquire or develop multifamily
properties newly acquired or developed properties may fail to perform as
expected we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired
property up to standards established for its intended market position or to
develop a property additionally we expect that other major real estate
investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive
investment opportunities this competition has increased prices for
multifamily properties we may not be in a position or have the opportunity
in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms

         because real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to
         sell properties when appropriate

         real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not
be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other
conditions this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance
of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability
to make distributions to our security holders

         changes in laws could affect our business

         we are generally not able to pass through to our tenants under
existing leases increases in real estate taxes income taxes and service or
other taxes consequently any such increases may adversely affect our
financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our
security holders similarly changes that increase our potential liability
under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance
would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our
securities

shareholders ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited

                                     16

         provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit
         changes in control

         certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay
or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that
could provide the security holders with a premium over the thenprevailing
market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best
interest of our security holders these include a staggered board of trustees
and the 5 ownership limit described below see we have a share ownership
limit for reit tax purposes also any future series of preferred shares of
beneficial interest may have certain voting provisions that could delay or
prevent a change of control or other transactions that might otherwise be in
the interest of our security holders

         we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes

         to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes not
more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or
indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of
any year to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification our
declaration of trust subject to certain exceptions prohibits ownership by
any single shareholder of more than 5 of the lesser of the number or value
of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares see control and
influence by significant shareholdersmr zell and others are exempt from the
5 ownership limit generally applicable to securities holders we refer to
this restriction as the ownership limit absent any exemption or waiver
securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be
transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable
beneficiary and the security holders rights to distributions and to vote
would terminate a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to
violate the ownership limit the ownership limit could delay or prevent a
change in control and therefore could adversely affect our security
holders ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price
for their shares

         our preferred shares of beneficial interest may affect changes in
         control

         our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue
up to 100 million preferred shares of beneficial interest and to establish
the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to
convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued the board of
trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of
such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company even
if a change in control were in the interest of security holders as of
december 31 2000 20003166 preferred shares were issued and outstanding

         inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control

         certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate
investment trusts prohibit business combinations including certain
issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten
percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities or with an
affiliate who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in
question was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power
of the trusts outstanding voting securities an interested shareholder
or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder these prohibitions last
for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder
became an interested shareholder after the fiveyear period a business
combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two
supermajority shareholder votes unless among other conditions the trusts
holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the
consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by
the interested shareholder for its common shares as permitted by maryland
law however the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these
restrictions with respect to any business combination involving the zell
original owners and persons acting in concert with any of the zell original
owners consequently the fiveyear prohibition and the supermajority vote
requirements

                                      17

will not apply to a business combination involving us and any of them such
business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders

our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax
requirements

         our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse
         consequences to our security holders

         we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal
income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31 1992 we plan
to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these
requirements however are highly technical and complex we cannot
therefore guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as
a reit the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various
factual matters that may not be totally within our control for example to
qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income must come from sources
that are itemized in the reit tax laws we are also required to distribute to
security holders at least 95 of our reit taxable income excluding capital
gains the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited
partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the
reit requirements even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize
our reit status furthermore congress and the irs might make changes to the
tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it
more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a reit we do
not believe however that any pending or proposed tax law changes would
jeopardize our reit status

         if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal
income tax at regular corporate rates also unless the irs granted us relief
under certain statutory provisions we would remain disqualified as a reit
for four years following the year we first failed to qualify if we fail to
qualify as a reit we would have to pay significant income taxes we
therefore would have less money available for investments or for
distributions to security holders this would likely have a significant
adverse affect on the value of our securities in addition we would no
longer be required to make any distributions to security holders

         we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our
         merger partners did not qualify as reits

         if any of our recent merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit
throughout the duration of their existence then they might have had
undistributed c corporation earnings and profits at the time of their
merger with us if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings
and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place we
might not qualify as a reit we believe that each of our merger partners
qualified as a reit and that in any event none of them had any
undistributed c corporation earnings and profits at the time of their
merger with us if any of our merger partners failed to qualify as a reit an
additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at
the time they were merged with us we would be liable for the tax on such
gain in this event we would have to pay corporate income tax on any gain
existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the
merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger finally we
could be precluded from electing reit status for up to four years after the
year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for reit status

         other tax liabilities

         even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal
state and local taxes on our income and property in addition our
thirdparty management operations which are conducted through subsidiaries
generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates

                                      18

we depend on our key personnel

         we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees
samuel zell and our executive officers particularly douglas crocker ii and
gerald a spector if they resign our operations could be temporarily
adversely effected mr crocker and mr spector have entered into deferred
compensation agreements with the company which provide both with a salary
benefit after their respective termination of employment with the company in
addition mr zell mr crocker and mr spector have entered into
noncompetition agreements with the company

compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial
condition

         distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company

         we may be required from time to time under certain circumstances
to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet
received in such event or upon our repayment of principal on debt we could
have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the
distribution requirements of a reit accordingly we could be required to
borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these
distribution requirements

         we are dependent on external sources of capital

         because of our annual reit distribution requirements we may not be
able to fund all future capital needs including for acquisitions and
developments from income generated by operations and the disposition of
certain assets we therefore may have to rely on thirdparty sources of
capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all our
access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of things
including the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and
potential future earnings moreover additional equity offerings if pursued
may result in dilution of security holders interests and additional debt
financing may increase our leverage

federal income tax considerations

         general

         the following discussion summarizes all of the federal income tax
considerations material to a holder of common shares it is not exhaustive of
all possible tax considerations for example it does not give a detailed
discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations the following
discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to
prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances
moreover it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to
shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws such as
insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or
brokerdealers foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or
residents of the united states

         the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a
material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase
ownership and disposition of common shares therefore it is essential that
each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with
regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholders
personal tax situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the
laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdiction

         our taxation

         we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december
31 1992 in any year in which we qualify as a reit we generally will not be
subject to federal income tax on the portion of our

                                      19

page

reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to
most corporations which pay a tax on their income and then distribute
dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive
however we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates
upon our reit taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our
shareholders we also may be subject to the corporate alternate minimum tax
on items of preference under this alternative tax regime in addition we
will be subject to a 4 excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit
distribution requirements moreover we may be subject to taxes in certain
situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate

         if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we
will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we
also may be subject to the corporate alternate minimum tax as a result
our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have
available to distribute to our shareholders unless entitled to statutory
relief we would be disqualified from qualification as a reit for the four
taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is
not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief

         our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to
satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code we are required
to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual
operating and other results these requirements relate to the sources of our
gross income the composition of our assets the amount of dividends we pay
to shareholders the diversity of our share ownership and other aspects of
our operations the purpose of these requirements is to allow the tax benefit
of reit status only to companies that

         a      primarily own and primarily derive income from real
                  estaterelated assets and certain other assets which are
                  passive in nature and

         b      distribute 95 of the taxable income 90 for taxable years
                  beginning january 1 2001 computed without regard to net
                  capital gain to shareholders

         on december 17 1999 as part of a larger bill the president signed
into law the reit modernization act rma effective beginning january 1
2001 the rma has amended the tax rules relating to the composition of a
reits assets under prior law a reit was precluded from owning more than
10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer other than a
wholly owned subsidiary or another reit beginning in 2001 a reit will
remain subject to this current restriction and will also be precluded from
owning more than 10 of the value of all classes of any one issuer

         there is an exception to this prohibition a reit will be allowed to
own up to 100 of the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary trs that
can provide services to reit tenants and others without disqualifying the
rents that a reit receives from its tenants however no more than 20 of the
value of a reits total assets can be represented by securities of one or
more trss the amount of debt and rental payments from a trs to a reit will
be limited to ensure that a trs is subject to an appropriate level of
corporate tax the new 10 asset test will not apply to certain arrangements
including third party subsidiaries in place on july 12 1999 provided that
a subsidiary does not engage in a substantial new line of business its
existing business does not increase and a reit does not acquire any new
securities in the subsidiary under the rma a third party subsidiary will be
able to convert tax free into a trs

         in addition to the above legislative changes effective january 1
2001 the distribution of taxable income requirement of a reit has been
reduced from 95 to 90 further effective january 1 2001 the 15 personal
property test which generally requires that a reits personal property not
exceed 15 of its real and personal property in order for income to be
considered rents from real property will be based on fair market values
instead of adjusted tax basis

                                      20

         we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable
years beginning with 1992 we also believe that our current structure and
method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit
however we cannot guarantee that the actual results of our operations have
satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code

         piper marbury rudnick  wolfe our special tax counsel will
provide an opinion to the effect that we were organized and have operated in
conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit
under the internal revenue code for each of our taxable years beginning in
1992 the opinion will also provide that our current organization and method
of operation should enable us to continue to meet the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a reit it must be emphasized that the opinion
will be based on various assumptions and factual representations relating to
our organization and our prior and expected operations in each case these
representations include representations about our predecessors piper
marbury rudnick  wolfe will not review our compliance with these
requirements on a continuing basis

         taxation of taxable domestic shareholders

         general if we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable
domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares other than capital
gain distributions will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the
distributions come out of earnings and profits these distributions will not
be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are
corporations in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and
profits we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares
and second to the common shares we cannot guarantee that we will have
sufficient earnings and profits to cover distributions on the preferred
shares

         to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic
shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits such distributions will
be considered a return of capital such distributions will be treated as a
tax free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholders common
shares by the amount of the distribution so treated to the extent that such
distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholders tax basis
such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of his shares
shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of
our net operating losses or capital losses

         distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain
dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the
sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year this
treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year it applies
regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her
common shares despite this general rule corporate shareholders may be
required to treat up to 20 of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary
income

         generally we will classify a portion of our designated capital
gains dividend as a 20 rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as
an unrecaptured section 1250 gain distribution as the names suggest a 20
rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that
are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20 an unrecaptured
section 1250 gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic
shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25

         if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain
dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to
holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest then the portion of
the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common
shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available
to the holders of the common shares for the year the denominator of

                                      21

page

the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of
all classes of shares of beneficial interest

         in general a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal
income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an
amount equal to the difference between

         a      the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property
                  received in the sale or other disposition and

         b      the shareholders adjusted tax basis in the common shares

         the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares
were held as a capital asset generally the capital gain or loss will be
longterm capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than
one year the taxpayer relief act of 1997 allows the irs to issue regulations
relating to the manner in which capital gain rates will apply to sales of
capital assets by reits and to sales of interests in reits the irs has not
issued these regulations however if the irs does issue these regulations
they could affect the taxation of gain and loss realized on the disposition
of common shares shareholders are urged to consult with their own tax
advisors with respect to the rules contained in the taxpayer relief act

         in general a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of
common shares that were held for six months or less determined after
applying certain holding period rules will be treated as longterm capital
loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were
treated as longterm capital gains for shareholders who are individuals
trusts and estates the longterm capital loss will be apportioned among the
applicable longterm capital gain rates to the extent that distributions
received by the shareholder were previously so treated

         we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally
required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that
gain if we make this election shareholders must include in income as
longterm capital gain their proportionate share of the undistributed net
capital gain shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate
share of the tax paid by us on these gains accordingly they will receive a
credit or refund for the amount shareholders will increase the basis in
their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain
included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having
paid our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately

         taxation of taxexempt shareholders

         most taxexempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax
except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income which is
often referred to as ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder holds its common
shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated
trade or business distributions to the shareholder should not constitute
ubti similarly if a taxexempt shareholder sells common shares the income
from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the
shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business

         however for taxexempt shareholders that are social clubs
voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit
trusts and qualified group legal services plans income from owning or
selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to
properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the
income generated by its investment in common shares these shareholders
should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve
requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code

         in addition certain pension trusts that own more than 10 of a
pensionheld reit must report a

                                      22

portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti we have
not been and do not expect to be treated as a pensionheld reit for purposes
of this rule

         taxation of foreign shareholders

         the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states
federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common
shares applicable to a foreign shareholder it is based on current law and is
for general information only a foreign shareholder is any person other
than

         a     a citizen or resident of the united states

         b      a corporation or partnership created or organized in the
                  united states or under the laws of the united states or of any
                  state thereof or

         c      an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income
                  for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of
                  its source

         distributions by us distributions by us to a foreign shareholder
that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united
states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains
dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that
they are made out of our earnings and profits these distributions ordinarily
will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross
basis at a 30 rate or a lower treaty rate unless the dividends are treated
as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a
united states trade or business please note that under certain treaties
lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to
dividends from reits dividends that are effectively connected with a united
states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated
rates and are generally not subject to withholding certification and
disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from
withholding under this exemption a foreign shareholder that is a corporation
also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate or a
lower treaty rate

         we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30 on
any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless

         a      a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or
                  certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is
                  filed with us or

         b      the foreign shareholder files an irs form 4224 with us
                  claiming that the distribution is effectively connected
                  income

         a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and
profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the
distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholders common
shares instead the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the
common shares to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis
of the common shares it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of
the shareholders common shares the tax treatment of this gain is described
below

         as a result of a legislative change made by the small business job
protection act of 1996 it appears that we will be required to withhold 10
of any distribution in excess of our earnings and profits consequently
although we intend to withhold at a rate of 30 or a lower applicable treaty
rate on the entire amount of any distribution to the extent that we do not
do so distributions will be subject to withholding at a rate of 10
however a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from
the irs if it subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in
excess of our earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the
foreign shareholders united states tax liability with respect to the
distribution

                                      23

         distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time
of the distributions as capital gain dividends other than those arising from
the disposition of a united states real property interest generally will not
be subject to united states federal income taxation unless

       a     the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with
               the foreign shareholders united states trade or business in
               which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same
               treatment as domestic shareholders except that a shareholder
               that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch
               profits tax as discussed above or

       b     the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is
               present in the united states for 183 days or more during the
               taxable year and has a tax home in the united states in which
               case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30
               tax on the individuals capital gains

         under the foreign investment in real property tax act which is
known as firpta distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable
to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will
cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income
effectively connected with a united states trade or business this rule
applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain
dividend accordingly foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these
distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders subject to a
special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals
in addition a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch
profits tax discussed above we are required to withhold 35 of these
distributions the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign
shareholders united states federal income tax liability

         although the law is not entirely clear on the matter it appears
that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the
common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to
foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital
gain dividends under that approach foreign shareholders would be able to
offset as a credit against the united states federal income tax liability
their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed
capital gains in addition foreign shareholders would be able to receive
from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid
by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability

         sales of common shares gain recognized by a foreign shareholder
upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to
united states taxation unless the shares constitute a united states real
property interest within the meaning of firpta the common shares will not
constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a
domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in
which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value
of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders we
believe that we are a domestically controlled reit therefore we believe
that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta
however because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded we
cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit
in any event gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise
subject to firpta will be taxable to a foreign shareholder if either

       a     the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with
               the foreign shareholders united states trade or business in
               which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same
               treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain or

       b     the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is
               present in the united states for 183 days or more during the
               taxable year and has a tax home in the united states in which
               case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30
               tax on the individuals

                                       24

               capital gains

         even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically
controlled reit gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign
shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states
taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if

       a     the class or series of shares being sold is regularly traded
               as defined by applicable irs regulations on an established
               securities market such as the new york stock exchange and

       b     the selling foreign shareholder owned 5 or less of the value of
               the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout
               the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or exchange

         if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to
taxation under firpta the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular
united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a
taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax
a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the
case of foreign corporations the purchaser of the common shares would be
required to withhold and remit to the irs 10 of the purchase price

         our management company and other subsidiaries a small portion of
the cash to be used by the operating partnership to fund distributions to us
is expected to come from payments of dividends on nonvoting stock of
management companies and other companies held by the operating partnership
these companies pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable
corporate rates they will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but
we cannot guarantee whether or the extent to which measures taken to
minimize these taxes will be successful to the extent that these companies
are required to pay taxes the cash available for distribution from these
management companies by us to shareholders will be reduced accordingly

         state and local taxes we and our shareholders may be subject to
state or local taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which it
or they transact business or reside the state and local tax treatment of us
and our shareholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequence
discussed above it is our belief that all the states will eventually conform
with the rma as described above consequently prospective shareholders
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local
tax laws on an investment in common shares

         as of december 31 2000 the company owned or had interests in a
portfolio of 1104 multifamily properties located in 36 states containing

         tenant leases are generally yeartoyear and require security
deposits the gardenstyle properties are generally defined as properties
with two andor three floors while the midrisehighrise properties are
defined as properties greater than three floors these two property types
typically provide residents with amenities which may include a clubhouse
swimming pool laundry facilities and cable television access certain of
these properties offer additional amenities such as saunas whirlpools spas
sports courts and exercise rooms or other amenities the ranchstyle
properties which are defined as single story properties generally do not
provide additional amenities for residents other than common laundry
facilities and cable television access

         it is managements role to monitor compliance with property policies
and to provide preventive maintenance of the properties including common
areas facilities and amenities the company holds periodic meetings of its
property management personnel for training and implementation of the
companys strategies the company believes that due in part to this
strategy the properties historically have had high occupancy rates

         the distribution of the properties throughout the united states
reflects the companys belief that geographic diversification helps insulate
the portfolio from regional and economic influences at the same time the
company has sought to create clusters of properties within each of its
primary markets in order to achieve economies of scale in management and
operation however the company may acquire additional multifamily properties
located anywhere in the united states

         the company beneficially owns fee simple title to 991 of the 998
controlled properties and holds a remaining 66year leasehold interest with
respect to one property mallgate in addition with respect to two
properties the company owns the debt collateralized by such properties and
with respect to four properties the company owns an interest in the debt
collateralized by the properties the remaining 106 properties represent
partially owned and unconsolidated properties containing 20094 units

         direct fee simple title for certain of the properties is owned by
singlepurpose nominee corporations llcs or land trusts that engage in no
business other than holding title to the property for the benefit of the
company holding title in such a manner is expected to make it less costly to
transfer such property in the future in the event of a sale and should
facilitate financing since lenders often require title to a property to be
held in a single purpose entity in order to isolate that property from
potential liabilities of other properties direct fee simple title for
certain other properties is owned by a single llc

         the company also leases under operating leases various management
regional and corporate offices throughout the united states

         the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard
sfas no 133138 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities on january 1 2001 this new accounting standard requires
companies to carry all derivative instruments including certain embedded
derivatives in the statement of financial condition at fair value the
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends
on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging
relationship and if so on the reason for holding it the company uses only
qualifying hedges that are designated specifically to reduce exposure to
interest rate risk by locking in the expected future cash payments on certain
liabilities this is typically accomplished using an interest rate swap or
treasury lock collar for financial reporting purposes the gain or loss on
the effective portion of the interest rate hedge is recorded as a component
of equity which becomes reclassified into earnings along with payments on
the hedged liability

         upon adoption of sfas no 133138 in january 2001 the company
recorded a net transition adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive
income and either an unrealized gain or loss on hedges at that time which did
not have a material impact on the companys financial condition and results
of operations adoption of the standard resulted in the company recognizing a
derivative instrument liability in general the amount of volatility will
vary with the level of derivative activities during any period

depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated
entities and extraordinary items adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships
and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the
same basis this definition of ffo is in accordance with the national
association of real estate investment trusts nareit recommended
definition nareit modified this definition effective january 1 2000
nevertheless this modification had no impact upon the companys calculation
of ffo for either the current or prior periods presented

         the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a
supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company
because along with cash flows from operating activities financing
activities and investing activities it provides investors an understanding
of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital
expenditures ffo in and of itself does not represent cash generated from
operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be
considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the companys
performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by
gaap as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash
available to fund cash needs the companys calculation of ffo may differ
from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other real estate
companies and may differ as a result of differences between the companys and
other real estate companys accounting policies for replacement type items
and accordingly may not be comparable to such other real estate companies

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

         the companys future earnings cash flows and fair values relevant to
financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates market risk is
the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates the
company manages its market risk by matching projected cash inflows from
operating properties financing activities and investing activities with
projected cash outflows to fund debt payments acquisitions capital
expenditures distributions and other cash requirements the company also
utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk interest
rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed
rate basis derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes

         the company has total outstanding debt of approximately 57 billion at
december 31 2000 of which approximately 8210 million or 144 is floating
rate debt including the effects of any interest rate protection agreements if
market rates of interest on the companys floating rate debt increase by 61
basis points a 10 increase the increase in interest expense on the companys
floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by
approximately 50 million if market rates of interest on the companys
floating rate debt decrease by 61 basis points a 10 decrease the decrease in
interest expense on the companys floating rate debt would increase future
earnings and cash flows by approximately 50 million

         these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical
interest rates and equity prices on the companys financial instruments these
analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic
activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a
change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further
mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the
specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects this analysis
assumes no changes in the companys financial structure

                         report of independent auditors


to the board of trustees and shareholders
equity residential properties trust

we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of equity
residential properties trust the company as of december 31 2000 and 1999
and the related consolidated statements of operations changes in shareholders
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december
31 2000 our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the index at item 14a these financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the companys management our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits

we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement an audit includes examining on a test basis evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements an audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion

in our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of equity
residential properties trust at december 31 2000 and 1999 and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended december 31 2000 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states also in our opinion the related
financial statement schedule when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein

mergers was used as the valuation basis for each of the combinations the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include the
results of the properties purchased through the mergers from their respective
closing dates

management limited partnerships and companies collectively the management
partnerships or the management companies the financing partnerships the
llcs and certain other entities each such entity has been consolidated with
the company for financial reporting purposes in regard to the management
companies the company does not have legal control however these entities are
consolidated for financial reporting purposes the effects of which are
immaterial

      real estate assets and depreciation

         real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation less an
adjustment if any for impairment a land value is assigned based on the
purchase price if acquired separately or based on market research if acquired in
a merger or in a single or portfolio acquisition

         for real estate properties to be disposed of an impairment loss is
recognized when the fair value of the real estate less the estimated cost to
sell is less than the carrying amount of the real estate measured at the time
it is certain that the company will sell the property real estate held for
disposition is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated
fair value less its cost to sell

         depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets the company uses a 30year estimated life for
buildings and a fiveyear estimated life for initial furniture fixtures and
equipment replacements inside a unit such as appliances and carpeting are
depreciated over a fiveyear estimated life expenditures for ordinary
maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant
renovations and improvements that improve andor extend the useful life of the
asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life generally five to ten
years initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense
approximates the deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over
the lease terms property sales or dispositions are recorded when title
transfers and sufficient consideration has been received by the company upon
disposition the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
respective accounts any gain or loss on sale of disposition is recognized in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

         the company classifies properties under development andor expansion
and properties in the lease up phase as construction in progress until
construction has been completed and all certificates of occupancy permits have
been obtained the company also classifies land relating to construction in
progress as land on its balance sheet

      cash and cash equivalents

         the company considers all demand deposits money market accounts and
investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with
a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents the company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial
institutions the combined account balances at each institution periodically
exceed the federal depository insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage
and as a result there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on
deposit in excess of fdic insurance coverage the company believes that the risk
is not significant as the company does not anticipate their nonperformance

      deferred financing costs

         deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain the
companys lines of credit longterm financings and costs for certain interest
rate protection agreements these costs are amortized over the terms of the
related debt unamortized financing costs are writtenoff when debt is retired
before the maturity date the accumulated amortization of such deferred
financing costs was 177 million and 111 million at december 31 2000 and
1999 respectively

      rental furniture

         rental furniture is stated at cost and depreciated on a straightline
basis at a rate of 1 per month which is designed to approximate an estimated
useful life of four years with provision for a 50 residual value

      property and equipment

         property and equipment is stated at cost depreciation expense is
provided on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives of three to ten
years

      goodwill

         goodwill is amortized on a straightline basis over a period of 20
years the company periodically reviews goodwill for impairment and if a
permanent decline in value has occurred the company would reduce its goodwill
balance to fair value accumulated amortization of goodwill was 18 million at
december 31 2000

      derivative instruments and hedging activities

         the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas
no 133138 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities on
january 1 2001 this new accounting standard requires companies to carry all
derivative instruments including certain embedded derivatives in the statement
of financial condition at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair
value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and
qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and if so on the reason for
holding it the company uses only qualifying hedges that are designated
specifically to reduce exposure to interest rate risk by locking in the expected
future cash payments on certain liabilities this is typically accomplished
using an interest rate swap or treasury lock collar for financial reporting
purposes the gain or loss on the effective portion of the interest rate hedge
is recorded as a component of equity which becomes reclassified into earnings
along with payments on the hedged liability

         upon adoption of sfas no 133138 in january 2001 the company
recorded a net transition adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive
income and either an unrealized gain or loss on hedges at that time which did
not have a material impact on the companys financial condition and results
of operations adoption of the standard resulted in the company recognizing a
derivative instrument liability in general the amount of volatility will
vary with the level of derivative activities during any period

      fair value of financial instruments

         the fair values of the companys financial instruments excluding the
companys investment in


                                     f12
page

mortgage notes  see note 8 including cash and cash equivalents mortgage
notes payable other notes payable lines of credit and other financial
instruments approximate their carrying or contract values

      revenue recognition

         rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from tenants
and is recognized monthly as it is earned which is not materially different
than on a straightline basis interest income is recorded on an accrual basis
leases entered into between a tenant and a property for the rental of an
apartment unit are yeartoyear renewable upon consent of both parties on a
yeartoyear or monthtomonth basis

         leases of furniture generally have an initial term of three to six
months in duration and can be extended by the customer on a monthtomonth
basis furniture rentals are accounted for as operating leases and revenue is
recorded in the month earned for sales of furniture as well as rental buyouts
revenue and related cost of sales are recorded when the furniture is delivered
or taken off lease revenues from both furniture rentals and sales are included
in furniture income while the associated costs of those rentals and sales are
included in furniture operating expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations

      income taxes

         due to the structure of the company as a reit and the nature of the
operations of the properties and management business the results of operations
contain no provision for federal income taxes the company is subject to certain
state and local income excise and franchise taxes the aggregate cost of land
and depreciable property for federal income tax purposes as of december 31 2000
and 1999 was approximately 92 billion and 91 billion respectively

      minority interests

         operating partnership net income is allocated to minority interests
based on their respective ownership percentage of the operating partnership the
ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the number of operating
partnership units op units held by the minority interests by the total op
units held by the minority interests and the company issuance of additional
common shares and op units changes the ownership interests of both the minority
interests and the company such transactions and the proceeds therefrom are
treated as capital transactions

          partially owned properties the company reflects minority interests in
partially owned properties on the balance sheet for the portion of properties
consolidated by the company that are not wholly owned by the company the
earnings or losses from those properties attributable to the minority interests
are reflected as minority interests in partially owned properties in the
consolidated statements of operations

      use of estimates

         in preparation of the companys financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management makes
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these
estimates

      reclassifications

         certain reclassifications have been made to the previously reported
financial statements in order to


                                     f13
page

provide comparability with the 2000 statements reported herein these
reclassifications have not changed the results of operations or shareholders
equity

      reportable segments

         the company has one primary reportable business segment which consists
of investment in rental real estate the companys primary business is owning
managing and operating multifamily residential properties which includes the
generation of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment
units to tenants the company also has a segment for corporate level activity
including such items as fee and asset management income furniture rentalsales
activity interest income earned on shortterm investments and investment in
mortgage notes income or loss from investments in unconsolidated entities
general and administrative expenses and interest expense on mortgage notes
payable unsecured note issuances and lines of credit the companys fee and
asset management and furniture rentalsales activities are immaterial and do not
meet the threshold requirements of reportable segments as provided for in
statement no 131

         the company evaluates performance and allocates resources primarily
based on the rental furniture and other income generated from each property
less property and maintenance expenses real estate taxes and insurance
property management expenses fee and asset management expenses and furniture
expenses which is considered net operating income noi however all other
segment measurements are disclosed in the companys consolidated financial
statements and accordingly the accounting policies of the reportable segments
are the same as those described elsewhere in the summary of significant
accounting policies

         the company also considers funds from operations ffo to be a
primary measure of the performance of real estate companies including an equity
reit the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the
performance of an equity reit because along with cash flows from operating
activities financing activities and investing activities it provides investors
an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to
make capital expenditures ffo in and of itself does not represent cash
generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states gaap and therefore should not be
considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the companys
performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap
as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to
fund cash needs the companys calculation of ffo represents net income
available to common shares excluding gains or losses on dispositions of
properties gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and writeoff of
unamortized costs on refinanced debt plus depreciation on real estate assets
and income allocated to minority interests the companys calculation of ffo may
differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and
accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits the company adopted
effective january 1 2000 the national association of real estate investment
trusts nareit updated recommended definition of ffo as approved in the
fourth quarter of 1999

         all revenues are from external customers and no revenues are generated
from transactions with other segments there are no tenants who contributed 10
or more of the companys total revenues during 2000 1999 or 1998 interest
expense on debt is not allocated to individual properties even if the
properties secure such debt further minority interest in consolidated
subsidiaries is not allocated to the properties

common shares subject to conditions and restrictions as described in the fifth
amended option and award plan finally certain executive officers of the
company are subject to the companys performance based restricted share grant
agreement options and sars are sometimes referred to herein as awards

         the company has reserved 12500000 common shares for issuance under
the fifth amended option and award plan the options generally are granted at
the fair market value of the companys common shares at the date of grant vest
over a three year period are exercisable upon vesting and expire ten years from
the date of grant the exercise price for all options under the fifth amended
option and award plan shall not be less than the fair market value of the
underlying common shares at the time the option is granted the fifth amended
option and award plan will terminate at such time as no further common shares
are available for issuance upon the exercise of options and all outstanding
options have expired or been exercised the board of trustees may at any time
amend or terminate the fifth amended option and award plan but termination will
not affect awards previously granted any options which had vested prior to
such a termination would remain exercisable by the holder thereof

         as to the options that have been granted through december 31 2000
generally onethird are exercisable one year after the initial grant onethird
are exercisable two years following the date such options were granted and the
remaining onethird are exercisable three years following the date such options

         the company has elected to apply the provisions of accounting
principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees
apb no 25 in the computation of compensation expense under apb no
25s intrinsic value method compensation expense is determined by computing
the excess of the market price of the shares over the exercise price on the
measurement date for the companys share options the intrinsic value on the
measurement date or grant date is zero and no compensation expense is
recognized for the companys restricted shares the company determines the
intrinsic value on the measurement date and accordingly recognizes a
compensation expense for such shares fasb statement of financial accounting
standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation statement no
123 requires the company to disclose pro forma net income and income per
share as if a fair value based accounting method had been used in the
computation of compensation expense the fair value of the options computed
under statement no 123 would be recognized over the vesting period of the
options the fair value for the companys options was estimated at the time
the options were granted using the black scholes option pricing model with
the following weightedaverage assumptions for 1998 1999 and 2000
respectively riskfree interest rates of 537 584 and 622 dividend
yields of 598 689 and 683 volatility factors of the expected market
price of the companys common shares of 0212 0209 and 0207 and a
weightedaverage expected life of the options of seven years

         the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable in addition option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility because the companys options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in managements
opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its options

         for purposes of pro forma disclosures the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period the following
is the pro forma information for the three years ended december 31 2000 1999
and 1998
