seasonality 

we have in the past and expect in the future to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and new customer contracts with the fourth quarter historically being our strongest quarter for new customer contracts renewals and customer golives although the growth of our cloud solutions and the ratable nature of our fees makes this seasonality less apparent in our overall results of operations we expect our revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the fourth and first quarters of each year fourth quarter revenue is driven by yearend processing fees and dayforce customer golives and first quarter revenue is driven by revenue earned for printing of yearend tax packages

 item 1a r isk factors 

risks related to our business and industry 

our business ordinarily encounters and addresses risks some of which can cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to its understanding the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements in addressing these risks you should also refer to the information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

our quarterly results of operations have and may continue to fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business 

our quarterly results of operations including the levels of our revenues gross margin profitability cash flow and deferred revenue has varied and may vary significantly in the future and periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful accordingly the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business these factors include our ability to attract and retain new and current cloud customers as well as dayforce wallet customers changes on services or pricing impacting our customer contracts seasonal variations in sales of and revenue from our applications changes on our operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business including new acquired businesses operations and infrastructure and general economic industry and market conditions including the addition or loss of employees by our cloud customers who generally pay on a “per employee per month” basis interest rates and accounting rules 

our business plan is focused on an aggressive growth strategy if we fail to manage our growth effectively or if our strategy is not successful we may be unable to execute our business plan to maintain high levels of service or to adequately address competitive challenges 

we have and we believe we will continue to experience a period of rapid growth in our operations and cloud solutions the growth of our operations and cloud solutions has and may continue to place a strain on our management administrative operational technological and financial infrastructure in order to manage our growth effectively we will need to continuously improve our operational financial technological and management systems and our internal controls reporting systems and procedures to scaled global capabilities which may require investment as we grow and could result in disruption as we transform failure to effectively manage growth or to achieve our growth strategy could result in problems or delays in implementing customers declines in quality or customer satisfaction increases in costs complications in introducing new features or other operational challenges and any of these difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

revenues from our cloud solutions have grown substantially over the last few years our efforts to continue increasing use of our cloud solutions and our other applications including the dayforce wallet may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

our ability to continue to grow the revenues from our cloud solutions through execution against our growth levers depends on the quality of our platform and solutions and our ability to design our cloud solutions to meet consumer demand and our ability to increase sales from existing customers depends on our customers’ satisfaction with our product and need for additional solutions our participation in new markets for native payroll and application expansion in various modules and features including the dayforce wallet is relatively new and it is uncertain whether these areas will ever result in significant revenues for us further the entry into new markets or the introduction of new features functionality or applications beyond our current markets and functionality may not be successful if we are unable to sell our cloud solutions including the dayforce wallet into new markets or to further penetrate existing markets or to increase sales from existing customers our revenue may not grow as expected which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations any factor adversely affecting sales of our cloud solutions including application release cycles delays or failures in new product functionality market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition and economic and market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

10 2021 form 10k 

  

if we are not able to provide new or enhanced functionality and features or keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards we may not be able to satisfy our aggressive growth strategy and the demand for our services may decline 

our ability to increase revenue will depend in large part on our ability to develop our existing cloud solutions to drive sales into new markets around the world to further penetrate our existing markets and to increase sales from existing customers who do not utilize the full dayforce suite our future success and the success of our growth strategy will depend upon our ability to anticipate and to adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and to effectively develop to introduce to market and to gain broad acceptance of new service offerings and enhancements incorporating the latest technological advancements we may not be able to successfully provide new or enhanced functionality and features for our existing solutions that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments our attempts to develop new or enhanced functionality may be expensive and impact our profitability failure in this regard may a material adverse effect on our business growth strategy financial condition and results of operations 

our international growth strategy has and will expose us to risks inherent in international sales and operations 

one of our growth levers is international sales growth into new markets and we anticipate that customers and potential customers may increasingly require and demand that a single vendor provide hcm solutions and services for their employees in a number of countries our global recent expansion and any future expansion into new markets has and will require commensurate ongoing expansion of our monitoring of local laws and regulations which increases our costs as well as the risk of the product not incorporating in a timely fashion or at all the necessary changes to enable a customer to be compliant with such laws additionally our international operations are subject to risks that could adversely affect those operations or our business as a whole including but not limited to the costs of establishing a market presence localizing product and service offerings for foreign customers difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and increased expenses related to introducing corporate policies and controls in our international operations and increased reliance on partners to provide services in additional geographies as part of our international strategy we work with partners to perform services in certain geographies where we do not currently have international operations or the particular service required by our customers as a result we may experience business impact if our partners do not carry out the services as committed including potential for reduced margin from additional expense or impact to customer relationships 

our international growth strategy has and may continue to include growth via acquisition in which case our growth may also be dependent on our ability to transition acquired customers from current products to dayforce or to increase sales by addressing broader hcm needs with additional modules of dayforce 

if we are unable to provide the required services on a multinational basis or if we are unable to effectively manage our international expansion we could be subject to negative customer experiences harm to our reputation or loss of customers claims for any fines penalties or other damages suffered by our customer and other financial harm including fines penalties or other damages suffered by us directly which would negatively impact revenue and earnings although we have a multinational strategy additional investment and efforts may be necessary to implement such strategy some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include breadth and depth of product functionality scalability and reliability of applications robust workforce management comprehensive tax services modern and innovative cloud technology platforms combined with an intuitive user experience multicountry and jurisdiction domain expertise in payroll and hcm quality of implementation and customer service integration with a wide variety of third party applications and systems total cost of ownership and return on investment brand awareness and reputation pricing and distribution 

we face a variety of competitors some of which are longestablished providers of hcm solutions many of our current and potential competitors are larger have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do and are able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products and services some of our competitors do or could offer hcm solutions bundled as part of a larger product offering furthermore our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or to withstand substantial price competition in addition many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger customer bases and major distribution 

11 2021 form 10k 

  

agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product offerings or resources although we have a global partnership strategy additional investment and efforts will be necessary to implement such a strategy 

if our competitors’ products services or technologies become more accepted than our applications are today if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours or if their products or services are more technologically capable than ours it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our competitors may offer their products and services at a lower price compared to our products or their current pricing impacting our ability to achieve our target pricing if we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels or if we experience significant pricing pressures it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our aging software infrastructure technology and sophistication of these systems may lead to increased costs vulnerability to cyberattack or disruptions in operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business market brand financial condition and results of operations 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems and technology including technology infrastructure assets these systems and technologies must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis in order for us to meet both our customers’ and employees’ demands and expectations some of the crucial platforms on which we host our back office and bureau systems are aged and need to be replaced or are in the process of being replaced if we are unable to replace our aged crucial platforms if some or all these platforms fail to operate due to a software error or infrastructure failure if we fail to continue to refine and update our systems and technologies on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters if we do not appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems or we are unable to appropriately protect any of these systems we could suffer the loss of data vulnerabilities to cyberattack system outages or other performance problems which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

an information security breach of our systems or the loss of or unauthorized access to customer information or sensitive company information the failure to comply with the us federal trade commission’s “ftc” ongoing consent order regarding data protection or a system disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business market brand financial condition and results of operations 

our business is dependent on our payroll transaction financial accounting and other data processing systems we rely on these systems which are maintained both internally and externally at third parties to process on a daily and time sensitive basis a large number of complicated transactions we both through our internal systems and systems maintained by third parties electronically receive process store and transmit data and personal information about our customers and their employees as well as our vendors and other business partners we keep this information confidential however both our internal and third party partners’ websites networks applications and technologies and other information systems may be targeted for sabotage disruption or data misappropriation further as we grow by acquisition these risks become acute in the period following the acquisition as we set about integrating the acquisition target’s systems into ours additionally as we retire our legacy products like our bureau payroll services we are decreasing investments in maintaining those systems which creates the potential for a potential security breach of one of those systems the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of personal information and other customer and individual and company information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business we and our third party providers maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data and maintain business continuity but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion cyberattacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data any information security breach in our business processes or of our processing systems whether they are maintained internally or externally at third parties has the potential to impact our customer information and sensitive company information including our financial reporting capabilities which could result in the potential loss of business and our ability to accurately report financial results if any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time we could potentially miss a critical filing period resulting in potential fees and penalties or lose control of customer data all of which could result in financial loss a disruption of our business liability to customers regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation 

we are subject to a twentyyear consent order with the ftc that became final in june 2011 stemming from a december 2009 criminal hack into our discontinued us payroll application we conceded no wrongdoing in the order and we were not subject to any monetary fines or penalties however in connection with the order we are required to 

12 2021 form 10k 

  

among other things maintain a comprehensive information security program that is reasonable and appropriate for our size and complexity and for the type of personal information we collect we are also required to have portions of our security program which apply to certain segments of our us business reviewed by an independent third party on a biennial basis maintaining updating monitoring and revising an information security program in an effort to ensure that it remains reasonable and appropriate in light of changes in security threats changes in technology and security vulnerabilities that arise from legacy systems is timeconsuming and complex and is an ongoing effort

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock may be volatile and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

the market price and volume of our common stock trading has experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations and volatility factors that may impact our performance and market price include those discussed elsewhere in this “risk factors” section of this annual report on form 10k and others such as announcements including filing with the sec by us or our competitors of acquisitions business plans or commercial relationships as well as new services any major change in our senior management or board of director sales or anticipated sales of our stock including sales by our officers directors and significant stockholders issuance of new negative or changed securities analysts’ reports or 

21 2021 form 10k 

  

recommendations or estimates investor perceptions of us and the industries in which we or our customers operate and threatened or actual litigation and governmental investigations 

these and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our common stock to fluctuate substantially which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock in addition securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company’s securities securities litigation against us regardless of the merits or outcome could result in substantial costs damage to our reputation and divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the issuance of additional stock including common stock issued upon conversion of our convertible senior notes will dilute all other stockholders 

the issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions financings our equity incentive plans our convertible senior notes or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to five hundred million shares of common stock and up to ten million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions or opportunities in the future we may pay for such acquisitions or opportunities in part or in full through the issuance of additional equity securities further the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of any of the convertible senior notes 

because we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future investors may not receive any return on investment unless they are able to sell common stock for a price greater than the purchase price 

we have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future consequently stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment there is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors have purchased their shares 

antitakeover protections in our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws or our contractual obligations may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions contained in our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market value of our common stock even if it would benefit our stockholders 

in addition under the agreements governing our credit facilities a change of control would cause us to be in default or could trigger dilutive or additional expenses for example in the event of a change of control default the administrative agent under our credit facilities would have the right or at the direction of lenders holding a majority of the loans and commitments under our credit facilities the obligation to accelerate the outstanding loans and to terminate the commitments under our credit facilities and if so accelerated we would be required to repay all of our outstanding obligations under our credit facilities 

further certain provisions in the convertible senior notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable

we sell dayforce through our direct sales force on a subscription peremployee permonth “pepm” basis our subscriptions are typically structured with an initial fixed term of between three and five years with evergreen renewal thereafter dayforce can serve customers of all sizes ranging from 100 to over 100000 employees we have rapidly grown the dayforce platform to 5434 live dayforce customers representing approximately 51 million active global users as of december 31 2021 in 2021 we added 528 net new live dayforce customers our customers vary across industries and no single customer constituted more than 1 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 our annual cloud revenue retention rate continues to exceed 95 due to our focus on solving complex problems and our superior customer experience please see below under how we assess our performance for further explanation of our cloud retention rate 

our business model 

our business model focuses on supporting the rapid growth of dayforce and maximizing the lifetime value of our dayforce customer relationships due to our subscription model where we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period and our high customer retention rates we have a high level of visibility into our future revenues the profitability of a customer to our business depends in large part on how long they have been a customer we estimate that it takes approximately two years before we are able to recover our implementation customer acquisition and other direct costs on a new dayforce customer contract 

over the lifetime of the customer relationship we have the opportunity to realize additional pepm revenue both as the customer grows or rolls out the dayforce solution to additional employees and also by selling additional functionality to existing customers that do not currently utilize our full platform we also incur costs to manage the account to retain customers and to sell additional functionality these costs however are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire and to take customers live 

revenues 

we generate recurring revenues primarily from recurring fees charged for the use of our cloud solutions dayforce and powerpay as well as from our bureau solutions we also generate professional services and other revenue associated primarily with the work performed to assist customers with the planning design and implementation of their cloudbased solution our solutions are typically provided through longterm customer relationships that result in a high level of recurring revenue we also generate recurring revenue from investment income on our cloud and bureau customer funds before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities customer employees or other third parties we refer to this investment income as float revenue 

for dayforce we primarily charge monthly recurring fees on a pepm basis generally onemonth in advance of service based on the number and type of solutions provided to the customer and the number of employees and other users at the customer our standard dayforce contracts are generally for a three to fiveyear period the average time it takes to implement dayforce typically ranges from three months for smaller customers to twelve months for larger customers we begin to generate recurring revenue when we provide a production instance to the customer generally when they are ready to go live we also provide outsourced human resource solutions to certain of our dayforce customers which are tailored to meet their individual needs and entail performing the duties of a customer’s human resources department including payroll processing time and labor management performance management and recruiting as needed 

the powerpay offering serves our small market canadian customers the typical powerpay customer has fewer than 20 employees and the majority of the revenue is generated from recurring fees charged on a peremployee perprocess basis typical processes include the customer’s payroll runs yearend tax packages and delivery of customers’ remittance advices or checks powerpay can typically be implemented on a remote basis within one to three days at which point we start receiving recurring fees 

for our bureau solutions we typically charge recurring fees on a perprocess basis typical processes include the customer’s payroll runs yearend tax packages and delivery of customers’ remittance advices or checks in addition to customers who use our payroll services certain customers use our tax filing services on a standalone basis our outsourced human resource solutions are tailored to meet the needs of individual customers and entail our contracting to perform many of the duties of a customer’s human resources department including payroll processing time and labor management performance management and recruiting we also perform individual services for customers such as check printing wage attachment and disbursement and aca management

covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 to be a pandemic the global spread of the covid19 pandemic has continued to create significant global volatility uncertainty and economic disruption we have experienced and may continue to experience curtailed customer demand primarily as a result of declining employment levels at our customers in certain sectors such as retail and hospitality as well as lower customer utilization of professional services due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic additionally the federal funds rate cuts by the us federal reserve and the overnight rate target by the bank of canada have had negative effects on our float revenue the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance continue to generate uncertainty please refer to the “ results of operations ” section below for further discussion of the financial impacts of the covid19 pandemic during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 and to part ii  item 1a “risk factors ” for further discussion of the potential impact of the pandemic on our business

live dayforce customers 

we use the number of live dayforce customers as an indicator of future revenue and the overall performance of the business and to assess the performance of our implementation services as shown in the table below the number of customers live on dayforce has increased from 482 as of december 31 2012 to 5434 as of december 31 2021 for 2021 our 5434 live dayforce customers represented approximately 51 million active global users 

we market dayforce to customers of all sizes including small under 500 employees major 500 to 5999 employees and enterprise 6000 or more employees for 2021 small businesses accounted for 10 of the total number of active global users major businesses accounted for 49 of the total number of active global users and enterprise businesses accounted for 41 of the total number of active global users in 2021 we continued to grow our global customer base particularly in the enterprise market which aligns with our strategic growth lever to expand within this segment in addition to the increase in the number of enterprise customers we are successfully selling the broader hcm suite 

the following table sets forth the number of live dayforce customers at the end of the years presented 

 

cloud annualized recurring revenue “arr” 

we derive the majority of our cloud revenues from recurring fees primarily pepm subscription charges we also derive recurring revenue from fees related to the rental and maintenance of clocks charges for onceayear services such as yearend tax statements and investment income on our customer funds before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities customer employees or other third parties often referred to as “float revenue” to calculate cloud arr we start with recurring revenue at year end excluding revenue from ascender and adam hcm subtract the onceayear charges annualize the revenue for customers live for less than a full year to reflect the revenue that would have been realized if the customer had been live for a full year and add back the onceayear charges we set annual targets for cloud arr and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis 

excluding the 2021 acquisitions of ascender and adam hcm 

30 2021 form 10k 

  

annual cloud revenue retention rate 

our annual cloud revenue retention rate measures the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing cloud customers we use this retention rate as an indicator of customer satisfaction and future revenues we calculate the annual cloud revenue retention rate as a percentage excluding ascender and adam hcm where the numerator is the cloud arr for the prior year less the cloud arr from lost cloud customers during that year and the denominator is the cloud arr for the prior year our annual cloud revenue retention rate has been 95 or above for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we set annual targets for cloud revenue retention rate and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis by reviewing known and anticipated customer losses our cloud revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the mix of cloud solutions used by customers the level of customer satisfaction and changes in the number of users live on our cloud solutions 

dayforce recurring revenue per customer 

our dayforce recurring revenue per customer is an indicator of the average size of our dayforce recurring customer to calculate dayforce recurring revenue per customer we start with dayforce recurring revenue on a constant currency basis by applying the same exchange rate to all comparable periods for the trailing twelve months and exclude float revenue the impact of lower employment levels due to the covid19 pandemic and ascender and adam hcm revenue this amount is divided by the number of live dayforce customers at the end of the trailing twelve month period excluding ascender and adam hcm we set quarterly targets for dayforce recurring revenue per customer and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis our dayforce recurring revenue per customer may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the number of live dayforce customers and the number of customers purchasing the full hcm suite we have not reconciled the dayforce recurring revenue per customer because there is no directly comparable gaap financial measure 

constant currency revenue 

we present revenue on a constant currency basis to assess how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations we believe this nongaap financial measure is useful to management and investors we have calculated revenue on a constant currency basis by applying the average foreign exchange rate in effect during the comparable prior period please refer to the “ nongaap measures ” section for a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure 

the average us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate was 125 with a daily range of 120 to 129 for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 compared to 134 with a daily range of 127 to 145 for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 as of december 31 2021 the us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate was 127 

ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

we believe that ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin nongaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors we define ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude foreign exchange gain loss sharebased compensation expense and related employer taxes severance charges restructuring consulting fees and certain other nonrecurring items adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage that adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations please refer to the “ results of operations ” section below for a discussion of ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin

34 2021 form 10k 

  

the covid19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our revenue streams during the year ended december 31 2021 primarily in the form of lower employment levels at our customers lower float revenue resulting from reductions in the us federal reserve federal funds rate and the bank of canada overnight rate target lower average float balances for our customer funds and lower demand for professional services among other effects for the year ended december 31 2021 we estimate the impact of lower employment levels at our customers was an approximately 21 million reduction in our revenue of which approximately 17 million was related to dayforce and approximately 4 million was related to powerpay 

total revenue increased 1817 million or 216 to 10242 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 8425 million for the year ended december 31 2020 this increase was primarily driven by an increase in cloud revenue of 1437 million or 197 from 7294 million for the year ended december 31 2020 to 8731 million for the year ended december 31 2021 the cloud revenue increase was primarily due to an increase of 1332 million or 230 in cloud recurring revenue and 105 million or 70 in cloud professional services and other revenue cloud revenue growth was driven by both an increase in customers live on the dayforce platform and an increase in recurring revenue per customer as well as the cloud revenue generated from acquired businesses during 2021 

excluding float revenue and on a constant currency basis total revenue grew 222 reflecting a 198 increase in cloud revenue and a 375 increase in bureau revenue excluding float revenue and on a constant currency basis cloud revenue growth reflected a 240 increase in cloud recurring revenue and a 49 increase in cloud professional services and other revenue excluding float revenue and on a constant currency basis dayforce revenue increased 218 reflecting a 271 increase in dayforce recurring revenue and a 51 increase in dayforce professional services and other revenue excluding float revenue and on a constant currency basis powerpay revenue increased 32 

dayforce revenue grew 211 and powerpay revenue increased 82 in 2021 as compared to 2020 on a constant currency basis dayforce revenue increased 193 and powerpay revenue increased 14 for the yearended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 powerpay is designed primarily for small market canadian customers which typically have fewer than 20 employees and we believe those customers have been more adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic than larger dayforce customers 

in addition to the increase in cloud revenue bureau revenue increased by 380 million or 336 the increase is primarily due to bureau revenue associated with our recent ascender and excelity acquisitions the increase was partially offset by a reduction in bureau revenue associated with our legacy technology of the north american platforms as we continue to sunset the technology for the year ended december 31 2021 recurring revenue from bureau payroll customers accounted for 1034 million including 703 million from our two recent acquisitions in apj and bureau standalone tax recurring revenue accounted for 344 million compared to 730 million and 375 million in the prior year for payroll and standalone tax customers respectively

cost of revenue  total cost of revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 was 6419 million an increase of 1407 million or 281 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 recurring cost of revenue increased by 491 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to additional costs related to global expansion including ascender and excelity costs which are primarily classified as bureau additionally the increase is due to costs to support the growing dayforce customer base the increase in cost of revenue for professional services and other of 309 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to costs incurred to take new customers live 

product development and management expense increased 503 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase reflects increases in personnel costs as well as sharebased compensation excluding the impact of sharebased compensation and related employer taxes and severance expense product development and management expense would have increased by 419 million this increase reflects additional personnel costs as we work to build out the dayforce wallet and our international offerings for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 our investment in software development was 1317 million and 783 million

gross profit and gross margin total gross profit for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 410 million or 120 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the 410 million increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the 1332 million increase in cloud recurring revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020

income tax benefit for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we had income tax benefit of 149 million and 160 million respectively the 11 million reduction in tax benefit was primarily due to a tax increase of 82 million attributed to the base erosion antiabuse tax beat in the us a 40 million increase attributed to sharebased compensation a 40 million increase attributed to international tax rate differences and other increases of 46 million partially offset by a 148 million tax benefit from current operations and a 49 million tax benefit attributable to us state tax we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to reflect the net deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized as of december 31 2021 we will continue to record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets including some state net operating loss carryovers and tax basis intangibles 

net loss net loss was 754 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 40 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in net loss is primarily due to higher sharebased compensation lower employment levels at our customers and lower float revenue income due to the covid19 pandemic investments in product development selling capabilities and business acquisitions to support our growth initiatives in 2021 partially offset by the gain of 191 million on the sale of our st petersburg florida facility for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 net profit margin was 74 and 05 respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements and related notes requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our critical accounting estimates 

40 2021 form 10k 

  

revenue recognition 

description we recognize revenue for professional services and cloud subscription services performance obligations based on an allocation of the total transaction price to each performance obligation using the respective standalone selling prices “ssp” this can result in revenue being recognized in an amount that exceeds the amount we are contractually allowed to bill our customer as of a certain point in time resulting in the recognition of a contract asset up until the period at which billings are equal to or exceed revenue recognition we recognized 1602 million of cloud professional services revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 and the related contract assets were 627 million as of december 31 2021 

judgments and uncertainties the determination of our standalone selling price for the performance obligations requires us to make assumptions based on market conditions and observable inputs as well as an estimate of the total professional service hours expected to be incurred in connection with each customer implementation 

sensitivity of estimate to change the consideration allocated to professional services performed to activate a new customer is recognized as professional services revenues based on the proportion of total work performed to date compared to an estimation of total work expected to complete the implementation project for that customer account to the extent this consideration exceeds the customer billings a contract asset would be recognized an increase or decrease in the estimation of total work expected to complete the implementation would impact the amount of consideration allocated to each of the performance obligations as well as the timing of revenue recognition as professional services revenue related to implementation activities is generally recognized at the beginning of the contract 

business combinations 

description we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess recorded as goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties the acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is determined through established valuation techniques such as the income cost or market approach generally we use thirdparty valuation experts to assist in certain fair value determinations the fair value measurements of identifiable intangibles are based on available historical information and expectations and assumptions about the future significant assumptions used to value identifiable intangible assets may include projected revenue growth discount rates royalty rates customer attrition rates and other factors 

  

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment all acquired assets were determined to have useful lives 

sensitivity of estimate to change in 2021 we acquired ascender ideal datafuzion and adam hcm for 3596 million 414 million 179 million and 343 million respectively which included the acquisition of 71 million of trade names 841 million of customer relationships and 782 million in developed technology we utilized thirdparty valuation specialists to perform the valuation of certain assets and liabilities acquired for each acquisition 

trade names  from the ascender ideal and adam hcm acquisitions we acquired trade names which were determined to have a total fair value of 71 million using the relief from royalty method key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the trade names using this method included revenue projections royalty rates and discount rates 

customer relationships from the ascender ideal and adam hcm acquisitions we acquired customer relationships which were determined to have a total fair value of 841 million using the multiperiod excess earnings method “mpeem” a form of the income approach or variations of the mpeem such as the distributor method assumptions used in valuing these assets included future earnings projections customer attrition rates and discount rates among others 

developed technology from the ascender ideal datafuzion and adam hcm acquisitions we acquired developed technology which were determined to have a total fair value of 782 million using various methods such as the relief from royalty method and the mpeem including the distributor method assumptions used in valuing these assets included future earnings projections technology migration factors royalty rates tax rates and discount rates among others 

contingent consideration from the datafuzion acquisition we recognized contingent consideration which was determined to have a total fair value of 54 million using two methods a scenariobased method sbm and an option 

41 2021 form 10k 

  

pricing model opm specifically the black scholes merton model key assumptions used in the smb include possible outcomes probability of occurrence and discount factor key assumptions used in the opm include expected present value of certain arr and volatility 

we believe the estimates applied to the valuations are based on reasonable assumptions but are inherently uncertain as a result actual results may differ from the assumptions and judgments used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired which could result in impairment losses in the future

nonga ap measures 

ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

we believe that ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin nongaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors 

we define ebitda as net income loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and adjusted ebitda as ebitda as adjusted to exclude foreign exchange gains losses sharebased compensation expense and related employer taxes severance charges restructuring consulting fees and certain other nonrecurring items adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage that adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the control of operating management 

our presentation of ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity our presentation of ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by similar items to those eliminated in this presentation ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are included in this discussion because they are key metrics used by management to assess our operating performance

ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect the following 

• our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments 

• changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs 

• any charges for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may need to be replaced in the future 

• the impact of sharebased compensation upon our results of operations 

• the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt 

• our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes and

• certain other nonrecurring items

 item 7a quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and pension obligations we seek to minimize or manage these market risks through normal operating and financing activities these market risks may be amplified by events and factors surrounding the covid19 pandemic we do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the market fluctuations nor do we use instruments where there are not underlying exposures 

foreign currency risk  our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has historically been partially hedged as our foreign currency denominated inflows create a natural hedge against our foreign currency denominated expenses accordingly our results of operations and cash flows were not materially affected by fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and we believe that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates or an inability to access foreign funds would not materially affect our ability to meet our operational needs or result in a material foreign currency loss in the future due to the relative size of our international operations to date we have not instituted an active hedging program we expect our international operations to continue to grow in the near term and we are monitoring the foreign currency exposure to determine if we should begin a hedging program 

interest rate risk  in certain jurisdictions we collect funds for payment of payroll and taxes temporarily hold such funds in segregated accounts until payment is due remit the funds to the customers’ employees and appropriate taxing authority file federal state and local tax returns and handle related regulatory correspondence and amendments we invest the customer funds in highquality bank deposits money market mutual funds commercial paper or collateralized shortterm investments we may also invest these funds in government securities as well as highly rated assetbacked mortgagebacked corporate and bank securities 

based on current market conditions portfolio composition and investment practices a 100 basis point increase in market investment rates would result in approximately 23 million of increase in float revenue over the ensuing twelve month period in addition we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect customer fund balances for example a change in regulations either reducing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would reduce our average customer fund balances and float revenue there are no incremental costs of revenue associated with changes in float revenue 

we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be unrecoverable 

we do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

a 100 basis point increase in the libor rates would result in an approximately 7 million increase in our interest expense net over the ensuring twelvemonth period please refer to note 9 “debt” for additional information

pension obligation risk  we provide a pension plan for certain current and former us employees that closed to new participants on january 2 1995 in 2007 the us pension plan was amended 1 to exclude from further participation any participant or former participant who was not employed by the company or another participating employer on january 1 2008 2 to discontinue participant contributions and 3 to freeze the accrual of additional benefits as of december 31 2007 in applying relevant accounting policies we have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets discount rates and health care cost trends the cost of pension benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets assumptions for future periods contributions and benefit experience as of december 31 2021 the fair value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation pbo by 16 million and therefore was fully funded please refer to note 10 employee benefit plans for additional information 

the effective discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations in 2021 ranged from 200 to 236 the expected rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2021 was 270 the following table reflects the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes

our management with the participation of our cochief executive officers and our chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2021 based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2021 our cochief executive officers and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on the assessment management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap our independent

registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting which appears in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

on march 1 2021 we completed the acquisition of ascender prior to this acquisition ascender was a privatelyheld company not subject to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the rules and regulations of the sec or other corporate governance requirements to which public companies may be subject as of and for the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 ascender accounted for approximately 5 of our consolidated total assets and 7 of our consolidated total revenue 

as part of our ongoing integration activities we are in the process of incorporating internal controls over significant processes specific to ascender that we believe are appropriate and necessary to account for the acquisition and to consolidate and report our financial results in accordance with guidance issued by the sec companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the year of acquisition accordingly we have excluded ascender from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 as our integration activities are ongoing and incomplete 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

with the exception of internal controlrelated integration activities related to our acquisition of ascender there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15d and 15d15d of the exchange act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2021 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our cochief executive officers and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level however our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

seasonality

we have in the past and expect in the future to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and new customer contracts with the fourth quarter historically being our strongest quarter for new customer contracts renewals and customer golives although the growth of our cloud solutions and the ratable nature of our fees makes this seasonality less apparent in our overall results of operations we expect our revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the fourth and first quarters of each year fourth quarter revenue is driven by yearend processing fees and dayforce customer golives and first quarter revenue is driven by revenue earned for printing of yearend tax packages

 item 1a ris k factors 

risks related to our business and industry 

our business has been adversely affected and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic

the global spread of the covid19 pandemic has created significant global volatility uncertainty and economic disruption the covid19 pandemic began to adversely affect our operations in march 2020 and has continued to adversely affect our operations through december 31 2020 the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict including but not limited to

regulatory requirements placed on our software and services could impose increased costs on us delay or prevent our introduction of new products and services and impair the function or value of our existing products and services 

our services are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and as these requirements proliferate we are required to change or adapt our services to comply changing regulatory requirements might render our services obsolete or might block us from developing new products and services this might in turn impose additional costs upon us to comply or to further develop our services it might also make introduction of new services more costly or more timeconsuming than we currently anticipate and could even prevent introduction by us of new services or cause the continuation of our existing services to become more costly 

federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications in order to comply with these changes in addition government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet these laws or charges could limit the growth of internetrelated commerce or communications generally resulting in reductions in the demand for internetbased applications such as ours any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

as a public company we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm we have previously identified and reported material weaknesses and we may identify additional material weaknesses in internal controls in future periods if we were to have another material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated there could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our consolidated financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could have a material adverse effect on our previously reported results of operations 

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and to interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our previously reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change please refer to part ii item 8 note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  of this report for our assessment of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

litigation and regulatory investigations aimed at us or resulting from actions of our predecessor may result in significant financial losses and harm to our reputation 

we face risk of litigation regulatory investigations and similar actions in the ordinary course of our business including the risk of lawsuits and other legal actions relating to breaches of contractual obligations or tortious claims from customers or other third parties fines penalties interest or other damages as a result of erroneous transactions or breach of data privacy laws litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources which might materially harm our business overall financial condition and operating results we may also be subject to various regulatory inquiries such as information requests and book and records examinations from regulators and other authorities in the geographical markets in which we operate a substantial liability arising from a lawsuit judgment or settlement or a significant regulatory action against us or a disruption in our business arising from adverse adjudications in proceedings against our directors officers or employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results or operations insurance might not cover such claims might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us a claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs thereby harming our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to lower their expectations of our performance which could reduce the trading price of our stock

additionally we are subject to claims and investigations as a result of our predecessor control data corporation “cdc” ceridian corporation and other former entities for whom we are successorininterest with respect to assumed liabilities for example in september 1989 cdc became party to an environmental matters agreement with seagate technology plc “seagate” related to groundwater contamination on a parcel of real estate in omaha nebraska sold by cdc to seagate in february 1988 cdc entered into an arrangement with northern engraving corporation and the minnesota pollution control agency in relation to groundwater contamination at a site in spring grove minnesota although we are fully reserved for these groundwater contamination liabilities we cannot be certain if additional claims investigations or liabilities related to such predecessor companies will surface 

any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand

partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be ineffective or inadequate 

in order to protect our intellectual property rights we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and to protect these rights litigation brought to protect and to enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly timeconsuming and distracting to management with no guarantee of success and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights our failure to secure to protect and to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business

there is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry third parties including our competitors may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our service offerings and may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing upon such rights even if we are unaware of their intellectual property rights any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and if successfully asserted against us or if we decide to settle could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments obtain licenses modify applications prevent us from offering our services or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers vendors or partners in connection with any such claim or litigation even if we were to prevail in such a dispute any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming

the use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights 

some of our applications include software covered by open source licenses from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate such software into their products or applications the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our applications by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code to reengineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise to be limited in the licensing of our technologies each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and services in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the implementation of new accounting systems or applications could interfere with our business and operations

in 2020 we implemented a new general ledger system netsuite the implementation of new systems and enhancements may be disruptive to our business and can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention any disruptions relating to our systems or any problems with the implementation particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period could materially and adversely affect our business and operations

our credit facilities are secured substantially by all of our assets our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have important consequences for us including without limitation that 













under the terms of the agreements governing our debt facilities we are required to comply with specified operating covenants and under certain circumstances a financial covenant applicable to the revolving credit facility which may limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it if not cured an event of default under our senior credit facilities could result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable which would require us among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness to sell selected assets andor to reduce or to delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and any such financing or refinancing might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations or are forced to take additional measures to be able to service our indebtedness it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

volatility and weakness in bank and capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs for us 

disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect our lenders insurers customers and other counterparties during periods of volatile credit markets there is risk that lenders even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices could fail no longer participate in credit offerings or refuse to honor their existing legal commitments and obligations to us including but not limited to extending credit up to the maximum amount permitted by the revolving facility if our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their revolving credit commitments or we are unable to borrow or refinance our debt in the financial markets it could be difficult to obtain sufficient funding to execute our business strategy or to meet our liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt may be downgraded which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a reduction in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our short and longterm debt may negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock may be volatile and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

the market price and volume of our common stock trading has experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations and volatility this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our results of operations additional factors that may impact our performance and market price include those discussed elsewhere in this “risk factors” section of this annual report on form 10k and others such as





















these and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our common stock to fluctuate substantially which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock sometimes have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock securities litigation against us regardless of the merits or outcome could result in substantial costs damage to our reputation and divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the issuance of additional stock will dilute all other stockholders

the issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions financings our equity incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to five hundred million shares of common stock and up to ten million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions or opportunities in the future we may pay for such acquisitions or opportunities in part or in full through the issuance of additional equity securities 

because we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future investors may not receive any return on investment unless they are able to sell common stock for a price greater than the purchase price 

we have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future consequently stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment there is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors have purchased their shares

antitakeover protections in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws or our contractual obligations may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions contained in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market value of our common stock even if it would benefit our stockholders 

in addition under the agreements governing our credit facilities a change of control would cause us to be in default in the event of a change of control default the administrative agent under our credit facilities would have the right or at the direction of lenders holding a majority of the loans and commitments under our credit facilities the obligation to accelerate the outstanding loans and to terminate the commitments under our credit facilities and if so accelerated we would be required to repay all of our outstanding obligations under our credit facilities

overview 

ceridian is a global hcm software company we categorize our solutions into two categories cloud and bureau solutions cloud revenue is generated from hcm solutions that are delivered via two cloud offerings dayforce our flagship cloud hcm platform and powerpay a cloud hr and payroll solution for the canadian small business market we also continue to support customers using our legacy north america bureau solutions which we generally stopped actively selling to new customers following the acquisition of dayforce in 2012 we invest in maintenance and necessary updates to support our bureau customers and continue to migrate them to dayforce 

dayforce provides hr payroll benefits workforce management and talent management functionality our platform is used by organizations regardless of industry or size to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle including attracting engaging paying deploying and developing their people dayforce was built as a single application from the ground up that combines a modern consumergrade user experience with proprietary application architecture including a single employee record and a rules engine spanning all areas of hcm dayforce provides continuous realtime calculations across all modules to enable for example payroll administrators access to data through the entire pay period and managers access to realtime data to optimize work schedules our platform is designed to make work life better for our customers and their employees by improving hcm decisionmaking processes streamlining workflows revealing strategic organizational insights and simplifying legislative compliance the platform is designed to ease administrative work for both employees and managers creating opportunities for companies to increase employee engagement we are a founderled organization and our culture combines the agility and innovation of a startup with a history of deep domain and operational expertise 

in 2020 we launched the dayforce wallet in the united states which gives our customers’ employees greater control over their financial wellbeing by providing them with instant access to their earnings this ondemand pay feature allows employees more choice over when they get paid by making any day payday dayforce wallet enables workers to access their alreadyearned wages anytime during the pay period net of taxes withholdings and other payroll deductions leveraging dayforce’s continuous pay calculations dayforce wallet processes a sameday payroll each time a worker requests their pay the solution is compliant with federal state and local remittances and requires no changes to payroll processing including the funding timing and closeout of pay the ondemand wages are loaded onto a paycard which customers’ employees can use anywhere credit or debit cards are accepted generating interchange fee revenue 

we sell dayforce through our direct sales force on a subscription peremployee permonth “pepm” basis our subscriptions are typically structured with an initial fixed term of between three and five years with evergreen renewal thereafter dayforce can serve customers of all sizes ranging from 100 to over 100000 employees we have rapidly grown the dayforce platform to 4906 live dayforce customers representing approximately 42 million active global users as of december 31 2020 in 2020 we added 543 net new live dayforce customers our customers vary across industries and no single customer constituted more than 1 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 our annual cloud revenue retention rate continues to exceed 95 due to our focus on solving complex problems and our superior customer experience

our business model 

our business model focuses on supporting the rapid growth of dayforce and maximizing the lifetime value of our dayforce customer relationships due to our subscription model where we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period and our high customer retention rates we have a high level of visibility into our future revenues the profitability of a customer to our business depends in large part on how long they have been a customer because in our current business model pepm subscription fees are generally not charged until the customer goes live and because we incur costs in advance of receiving pepm revenue that are not offset by our implementation fees we estimate that it takes approximately 2 years before we are able to recover our implementation customer acquisition and other direct costs on a new dayforce customer contract 

over the lifetime of the customer relationship we have the opportunity to realize additional pepm revenue both as the customer grows or rolls out the dayforce solution to additional employees and also by selling additional functionality to existing customers that do not currently utilize our full platform we also incur costs to manage the account to retain customers and to sell additional functionality these costs however are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire and to implement the customer 

covid19 pandemic

 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 to be a pandemic the global spread of the covid19 pandemic has created significant global volatility uncertainty and economic disruption we have experienced and may continue to experience curtailed customer demand primarily as a result of declining employment levels at our customers in certain sectors such as retail and hospitality as well as lower customer utilization of professional services and customer delays in implementation services due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic additionally the federal funds rate cuts by the us federal reserve and the overnight rate target by the bank of canada have had and will continue to have negative effects on our float revenue the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain please refer to the “ results of operations ” section below for further discussion of the financial impacts of the covid19 pandemic during the year ended december 31 2020 and to part ii item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of the potential impact of the pandemic on our business 

how we assess our performance 

in assessing our performance we consider a variety of performance indicators in addition to revenue and net income set forth below is a description of our key performance measures 

 



 





live dayforce customers 

we use the number of live dayforce customers as an indicator of future revenue and the overall performance of the business and to assess the performance of our implementation services as shown in the table below the number of customers live on dayforce has increased from 482 as of december 31 2012 to 4906 as of december 31 2020 for 2020 our 4906 live dayforce customers represented approximately 42 million active global users

30    2020 form 10k

 

 

 

we market dayforce to customers of all sizes including small under 500 employees major 50 0 to 5999 employees and enterprise  6000 or more employees for 2020  s mall businesses accounted for 12  of the total number of active global users  major businesses accounted for 5 3  of the total number of active global users  and enterprise businesses accounted for 3 5  of the total number of active global users  

from 2019 to 2020 live dayforce customers increased from 4363 to 4906 a net increase of 543 of the customers taken live during 2020 76 represented net new customers to dayforce and the remainder were migration customers from our bureau solutions

the following table sets forth the number of live dayforce customers at the end of the years presented

 

annual cloud revenue retention rate 

our annual cloud revenue retention rate measures the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing cloud customers we use this retention rate as an indicator of customer satisfaction and future revenues we calculate the annual cloud revenue retention rate as a percentage where the numerator is the cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year less the cloud annualized recurring revenue from lost cloud customers during that year and the denominator is the cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year our annual cloud revenue retention rate has been 95 or above for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we set annual targets for cloud revenue retention rate and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis by reviewing known and anticipated customer losses our cloud revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the mix of cloud solutions used by customers the level of customer satisfaction and changes in the number of users live on our cloud solutions 

cloud annualized recurring revenue “arr” 

we derive the majority of our cloud revenues from recurring fees primarily pepm subscription charges we also derive recurring revenue from fees related to the rental and maintenance of clocks charges for onceayear services such as yearend tax statements and investment income on our customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities customer employees or other third parties often referred to as “float revenue” to calculate cloud arr we start with recurring revenue at year end subtract the onceayear charges annualize the revenue for customers live for less than a full year to reflect the revenue that would have been realized if the customer had been live for a full year and add back the onceayear charges we set annual targets for cloud arr and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis

constant currency revenue 

we present revenue on a constant currency basis to assess how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations we believe this nongaap financial measure is useful to management and investors we have calculated revenue on a constant currency basis by applying the average foreign exchange rate in effect during the comparable prior period

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin

we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin nongaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary sharebased compensation expense and related employer taxes severance charges restructuring consulting fees and certain other nonrecurring charges adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage that adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations please refer to the “ results of operations ” section below for a discussion of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin

revenue  the following table sets forth certain information regarding our consolidated revenues for periods presented

 



 



the covid19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our revenue streams during the year ended december 31 2020 primarily in the form of lower employment levels at our customers lower float revenue resulting from reductions in the us federal reserve federal funds rate and the bank of canada overnight rate target lower average float balances for our customer trust funds lower demand for professional services and customer delays in implementation services among other effects we estimate the impact of lower employment levels at our customers was an approximately 275 million reduction in our revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 of which approximately 205 million was related to dayforce and approximately 7 million was related to powerpay in addition we estimate the reduction in float revenue was approximately 20 million for the year ended december 31 2020 of the approximately 20 million reduction in float revenue approximately 15 million was due to rate reductions that occurred during the first quarter of 2020 and approximately 5 million was due to lower average float balances for our customer trust funds

694 million or 105  from 6600 million for the year ended december 31 2019  to 7294 million for the year ended december 31 2020  the cloud revenue increase was primarily due to an increas e of 617 million or 119  in cloud recurring services revenue and 77 million or 54  in cloud professional services and other revenue the increase in cloud recurring services revenue of 617 million was attributable to increases of  577 million from new customers addons and revenue uplift from migrations of bureau customers  214 million from the migrati on of bureau customers  partially offset by a  174 million decline in float revenue allocated to c loud recurring service s revenue

the increase in cloud revenue was partially offset by a decline in bureau revenue of 510 million or 311  of the decline in bureau revenue approximately 41 was attributable to customer migrations to dayforce as we continue to sunset the legacy technology of the north america bureau platforms we expect to see a continued decline in bureau revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 recurring services revenue from bureau payroll customers accounted for 730 million including 168 million from excelity and bureau standalone tax recurring services revenue accounted for 375 million

interest expense net interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2020 was 251 million compared to 324 million for the year ended december 31 2019 this 73 million reduction in interest expense net was primarily due to a reduction in our term debt rate and a reduction in the london interbank offered rate “libor” rates generally partially offset by increased debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from equity offerings as of december 31 2020 we had cash and equivalents of 1882 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of 3000 million our total debt balance was 6734 million as of december 31 2020 please refer to note 10 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt and the “our indebtedness” section below in october 2020 we contributed 1050 million to the us pension plan which represented 170 million of required minimum contributions and 880 million of voluntary contributions in 2019 we contributed 180 million to our us pension plan

our primary liquidity needs are related to funding of general business requirements including the payment of interest and principal on our debt capital expenditures and product development we believe that our cash flow from operations availability under our revolving credit facility and available cash and equivalents will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity it will be funded through the issuance of equity the incurrence of additional indebtedness or a combination thereof we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms or at all additionally our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and to fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance which is subject to general economic financial and other factors that are beyond our control accordingly we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs if we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions which would result in additional expenses or dilution

statements of cash flows 

changes in cash flows due to purchases of customer trust fund marketable securities and proceeds from the sale or maturity of customer trust fund marketable securities as well as the carrying value of customer trust fund accounts as of period end dates can vary significantly due to several factors including the specific day of the week the period ends which impacts the timing of funds collected from customers and payments made to satisfy customer obligations to employees taxing authorities and others the customer trust funds are fully segregated from our operating cash accounts and are evaluated and tracked separately by management therefore we have provided the table below excluding the cash flows and restricted cash and equivalents held within our customer trust funds to provide supplemental information regarding the cash flows related to our core business

nongaap measures

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin

we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin nongaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary sharebased compensation expense and related employer taxes severance charges restructuring consulting fees and certain other nonrecurring charges adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage that adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the control of operating management 

our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by similar items to those eliminated in this presentation adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are included in this discussion because they are key metrics used by management to assess our operating performance 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not defined under gaap are not measures of net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap and are subject to important limitations our use of the terms adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect the following

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and pension obligations we seek to minimize or manage these market risks through normal operating and financing activities we do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the market fluctuations nor do we use instruments where there are not underlying exposures 

foreign currency risk  our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar due to the relative size of our international operations to date we have not instituted an active hedging program we expect our international operations to continue to grow in the near term and we are monitoring the foreign currency exposure to determine if we should begin a hedging program 

interest rate risk  in connection with our us and canadian payroll and tax filing services we collect funds for payment of payroll and taxes temporarily hold such funds in trust until payment is due remit the funds to the customers’ employees and appropriate taxing authority file federal state and local tax returns and handle related regulatory correspondence and amendments we invest the us customer trust funds primarily in high quality bank deposits money market mutual funds or collateralized shortterm investments we may also invest these funds in us treasury and agency securities as well as highly rated assetbacked mortgagebacked municipal and corporate securities our canadian customer trust funds are invested in securities issued by the government and provinces of canada highly rated canadian banks and corporations assetbacked trusts and mortgages 

based on current market conditions portfolio composition and investment practices a 100 basis point increase in market investment rates would result in approximately 18 million of increase in float revenue over the ensuing twelve month period in addition we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect customer fund balances for example a change in regulations either reducing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would reduce our average customer trust fund balances and float revenue there are no incremental costs of revenue associated with changes in float revenue 

we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be unrecoverable 

we do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

a 100 basis point increase in the libor rates would result in an approximately 7 million increase in our interest expense net over the ensuring twelvemonth period please refer to note 10 “debt” for additional information 

pension obligation risk  we provide a pension plan for certain us current and former employees that closed to new participants on january 2 1995 in 2007 the us pension plan was amended 1 to exclude from further participation any participant or former participant who was not employed by the company or another participating employer on january 1 2008 2 to discontinue participant contributions and 3 to freeze the accrual of additional benefits as of december 31 2007 in applying relevant accounting policies we have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets discount rates and health care cost trends the cost of pension benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets assumptions for future periods contributions and benefit experience in 2020 we contributed 1050 million to our us pension plan which represented 170 million of required minimum contributions and 880 million of voluntary contributions 

the effective discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations in 2020 ranged from 142 to 187 the expected rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2020 was 57 the following table

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we implemented a new general ledger system in connection with this implementation we made modifications to certain processes that comprise our internal control over financial reporting as necessary to accommodate related changes in our systems and business processes to date this implementation has not had and we do not expect that it will have a material adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting

except as discussed above there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15d and 15d15d of the exchange act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2020 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level however our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of

controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

competition 

the market for hcm technology solutions is rapidly changing with legacy service bureau and onpremise software providers facing increased competition from emerging cloud players we currently compete with firms that provide both integrated and point solutions for hcm legacy payroll service providers such as automatic data processing “adp” provide hcm solutions primarily through service bureau models these vendors often have more inhouse resources greater name recognition and longer operating histories than dayforce and may seek to expand their cloud offerings through acquisition or organic product development we also compete with cloudenabled clientserver hcm providers such as the ultimate software group inc “ultimate software” these companies whose products were developed over 20 years ago as onpremise solutions have modified and redeployed their platforms as hybrid software as a service “saas” offerings this has allowed them to transition their business model to offer hosted and cloud solutions resulting in significantly larger customer bases more recently we face competition from modern hcm providers such as workday inc “workday” whose solutions have been specifically built as single application platforms in the cloud in addition we also face competition from large longestablished enterprise application software vendors such as oracle corporation “oracle” and sap se “sap” these companies are seeking to expand their cloud offerings through both acquisition and internal development efforts we also compete with point solutions such as kronos incorporated “kronos” for workforce management and cornerstone ondemand inc “cornerstone ondemand” for talent management 

we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following 

























employees and culture 

as of december 31 2019 we had 5011 active employees including 4168 in north america europe and australia and 843 in mauritius we also engage temporary employees and consultants when needed to enhance our workforce none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have never experienced any work stoppages

 item 1a ris k factors 

risks related to our business and industry 

we have a history of losses and negative cash flows from operating activities and we may not be able to attain or to maintain profitability or positive cash flows from operating activities in the future 

we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities over the last few years as we made substantial investments in developing launching and selling our cloud solutions in addition our highly leveraged capital structure has had a negative effect on our profitability we had net income of 33 million in the year ended december 31 2017 net loss of 606 million in the year ended december 31 2018 and net income of 787 million in the year ended december 31 2019 as of december 31 2019 we had an accumulated deficit of 2298 million we incurred negative cash flows from operating activities of 398 million in the year ended december 31 2017 and positive cash flows from operating activities of 95 million in the year ended december 31 2018 and 506 million in the year ended december 31 2019 to the extent we are successful in increasing our cloud customer base we may also incur increased net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities because costs associated with acquiring and implementing new cloud customers are generally incurred up front while subscription revenues are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements our recent growth in revenues may not be indicative of our future performance additionally while the majority of our revenue comes from fees charged for use of the software we are developing new products and services which may initially have a lower profit margin than our existing cloud solutions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we believe we will be able to reach profitability and attain positive cash flows from operating activities in the next few years we cannot provide any assurance that we will able to do so in the future 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include breadth and depth of product functionality scalability and reliability of applications robust workforce management comprehensive tax services modern and innovative cloud technology platforms combined with an intuitive user experience multicountry and jurisdiction domain expertise in payroll and hcm quality of implementation and customer service integration with a wide variety of third party applications and systems total cost of ownership and roi brand awareness and reputation pricing and distribution we face a variety of competitors some of which are longestablished providers of hcm solutions many of our current and potential competitors are larger have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do and are able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products and services some of our competitors could offer hcm solutions bundled as part of a larger product offering furthermore our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or to withstand substantial price competition in addition many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger customer bases and major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product offerings or resources 

in order to capitalize on customer demand for cloud applications legacy vendors are modernizing and expanding their applications through cloud acquisitions and organic development legacy vendors may also seek to partner with other leading cloud hcm providers we also face competition from vendors selling custom software and point solutions some of which offer cloud solutions our competitors include without limitation adp ultimate software and workday for hcm kronos for workforce management and cornerstone ondemand for talent management in addition other companies such as netsuite and microsoft that provide cloud applications in different target markets may develop applications or acquire companies that operate in our target markets and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal applications some large businesses may be hesitant to adopt cloud applications such as ours and prefer to upgrade the more familiar applications offered by these vendors that are deployed onpremise such as oracle and sap our competitors could offer hcm solutions on a standalone basis at a low price or bundled as part of a larger product sale with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants competition could intensify in the future 

 

 

if our competitors’ products services or technologies become more accepted than our applications if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours or if their products or services are more technologically cap able than ours it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our competitors may offer their products and services at a lower price if we are unable to achieve our target pri cing levels or if we experience significant pricing pressures it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy has focused on developing our cloud solutions which have experienced rapid revenue growth in recent periods that has been offset by revenue declines in our bureau solutions if we fail to manage our growth effectively or if our strategy is not successful we may be unable to execute our business plan to maintain high levels of service or to adequately address competitive challenges 

we have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our operations related to our cloud solutions in particular our recurring services revenue for our cloud solutions has continued to increase while our recurring services revenue for our bureau solutions has continued to decline as we implement our growth strategy for our cloud solutions we will continue to migrate employees and resources from our bureau solutions to our cloud solutions additionally we are continuing to invest in the infrastructure shared by our bureau and cloud solutions although we are no longer marketing our bureau solutions to new customers the growth of our cloud solutions has placed and future growth will place a significant strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure in order to manage this growth effectively we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures failure to effectively manage growth and failure to achieve our growth strategy could result in difficulty or delays in implementing customers declines in quality or customer satisfaction increases in costs difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties and any of these difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our bureau solutions which comprise a significant portion of our revenue may decline at a rate faster than we anticipate and we may not be able to successfully migrate our bureau customers to our cloud solutions or to offset the decline in bureau revenue with cloud revenue 

our growth strategy is focused on the growth and expansion of our cloud solutions however a portion of our revenue continues to be derived from our bureau customers we generally ceased marketing our bureau solutions to new customers in the united states in 2012 and since that time have maintained the bureau applications for existing customers while migrating customers to our cloud solutions maintenance of our bureau business requires investment specifically with respect to compliance updates and security controls if our investments are not sufficient to adequately update our bureau solutions such solutions may lose market acceptance and we may face security vulnerabilities 

in addition we have marketed our cloud solutions to our bureau customers and some of our bureau customers have migrated to our cloud solutions but there is no guarantee that our remaining bureau customers will migrate to our cloud solutions if such bureau customers do not migrate we may lose them in the future or we may be required to make ongoing investments to serve a smaller pool of customers if our revenue from our bureau solutions declines at a rate faster than anticipated we are required to make significant investments in infrastructure shared by our bureau and cloud solutions that are not offset by increased revenue we are not able to successfully convert the remaining bureau customers to our cloud solutions or our cloud solutions revenue does not grow fast enough to offset the decline in our bureau solutions revenue it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

if the market for enterprise cloud computing develops slower than we expect or declines it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the enterprise cloud computing market is not as mature as the market for onpremise enterprise software and it is uncertain whether cloud computing will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud computing in general and of hcm solutions in particular many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloud computing it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our applications the future growth rate and size of the cloud computing market or the entry of competitive applications the expansion of the cloud computing market depends on a number of factors including the cost performance and perceived value associated with cloud computing as well as the ability of cloud computing companies to address security and privacy concerns if we or other cloud computing providers experience security incidents loss of customer data disruptions in delivery or other problems the market for cloud computing applications as a whole including our applications may be negatively affected if cloud computing does not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for cloud computing caused by a lack of customer acceptance technological challenges weakening economic conditions security or privacy concerns competing technologies and products reductions in corporate spending or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our revenues from our cloud solutions have grown substantially over the last few years our efforts to increase use of our cloud solutions and our other applications may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

our revenues from our cloud solutions have grown substantially over the last few years our total cloud revenues grew from 4099 million in 2017 to 5288 million in 2018 and 6600 million in 2019 a growth rate of 290 and 248 respectively any factor adversely affecting sales of our cloud solutions including application release cycles delays or failures in new product functionality market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition and economic and market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our participation in new markets for native payroll and application expansion in succession management learning management and compensation management is relatively new and it is uncertain whether these areas will ever result in significant revenues for us further the entry into new markets or the introduction of new features functionality or applications beyond our current markets and functionality may not be successful 

our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business 

our quarterly results of operations including the levels of our revenues gross margin profitability cash flow and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future and periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful accordingly the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the value of our common stock factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include without limitation 























 

 















if we are not able to provide new or enhanced functionality and features or keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards we will not be able to remain competitive and the demand for our services will likely decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by changes due to rapid technological advances additional qualification requirements related to technological challenges and evolving industry standards and changes in the regulatory and legislative environment our future success will depend upon our ability to anticipate and to adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and to effectively develop to introduce to market and to gain broad acceptance of new product and service enhancements incorporating the latest technological advancements we may not be able to successfully provide new or enhanced functionality and features for our existing solutions that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments for example we are focused on enhancing the features and functionality of our hcm solutions to enhance their utility for larger customers with complex dynamic and global operations the success of new or enhanced functionality and features depends on several factors including their overall effectiveness and the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the enhancements new features or applications failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our solutions are designed to operate on a variety of systems we will need to continuously modify and enhance our solutions to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware ios and other software and communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in developing these new or enhanced functionality and features or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion if we do not continue to innovate and to deliver highquality technologically advanced products and services we will not remain competitive which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new functionality or new functionality to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development expenses any failure of our applications to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our applications result in customer dissatisfaction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

an information security breach of our systems or the loss of or unauthorized access to customer information the failure to comply with the us federal trade commission’s “ftc” ongoing consent order regarding data protection or a system disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business market brand financial condition and results of operations 

our business is dependent on our payroll transaction financial accounting and other data processing systems we rely on these systems to process on a daily and time sensitive basis a large number of complicated transactions we electronically receive process store and transmit data and personally identifiable information “pii” about our customers and their employees as well as our vendors and other business partners including names social security numbers and checking account numbers we keep this information confidential however our websites networks applications and technologies and other information systems may be targeted for sabotage disruption or data misappropriation the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of pii and other customer and individual information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business while we have information security and business continuity programs these plans may not be sufficient to ensure the uninterrupted operation of our systems or to prevent unauthorized access to the systems by unauthorized third parties because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures these concerns about information security are increased with the mounting sophistication of social engineering our network security hardening may be bypassed by phishing and other social engineering techniques that seek to use end user behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into our systems which might disrupt our delivery of services and make them unavailable and might also result in the disclosure or misappropriation of pii or other confidential or sensitive information in addition a significant cyber security breach could prevent or delay our ability to process payment transactions 

 

 

any information security breach in our business processes or of our processing systems has the potential to impact our customer information and our financial reporting capabilities which could result i n the potential loss of business and our ability to accurately report financial results if any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time we could potentially miss a critical filing period resulting in p otential fees and penalties or lose control of customer data all of which could result in financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to customers regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation the continued occurrence of highprofi le data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security if our security measures are breached as a result of third party action employee or subcontractor error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result  someone obtains unauthorized access to customer data our reputation may be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability we may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period of time te chniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are growing increasingly sophisticated as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls throughout the company despite these efforts it is possible that our security controls over data training and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of pii or other confidential information any issue of data privacy as it relates to unauthorized access to or loss of customer andor employee information could result in the potential loss of business damage to our market reputation litigation and regulatory investigation and penalties for example in december 2009 a criminal hacked into our discontinued us payroll application following receipt of an “access letter” in may 2010 from the ftc for a nonpublic review of the matter we worked with the ftc and entered into a twentyyear consent order which became final in june 2011 we conceded no wrongdoing in the order and we were not subject to any monetary fines or penalties however in connection with the order we are required to among other things maintain a comprehensive information security program that is reasonable and appropriate for our size and complexity and for the type of pii we collect we are also required to have portions of our security program which apply to certain segments of our us business reviewed by an independent third party on a biennial basis maintaining updating monitoring and revising an information security program in an effort to ensure that it remains reasonable and appropriate in light of changes in security threats changes in technology and security vulnerabilities that arise from legacy systems is timeconsuming and complex and is an ongoing effort 

there may be other such security vulnerabilities that come to our attention the independent third party that reviews our security program pursuant to the ftc consent order may determine that the existence of vulnerabilities in our security controls or the failure to remedy them in a timeframe they deem appropriate means that our security program does not provide a reasonable level of assurance that the security confidentiality and integrity of pii is protected by ceridian or that there was a failure to protect at some point in the reporting period while we have taken and continue to take steps to ensure compliance with the consent order if we are determined not to be in compliance with the consent order or if any new breaches of security occur the ftc may take enforcement actions or other parties may initiate a lawsuit any such resulting fines and penalties could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial results and any reputational damage therefrom could adversely affect our relationships with our existing customers and our ability to attain new customers our continued investment in the security of our technology systems continued efforts to improve the controls within our technology systems business processes improvements and the enhancements to our culture of information security may not successfully prevent attempts to breach our security or unauthorized access to pii or other confidential sensitive or proprietary information in addition in the event of a catastrophic occurrence either natural or manmade our ability to protect our infrastructure including pii and other customer data and to maintain ongoing operations could be significantly impaired our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies may not be successful in mitigating the effects of a catastrophic occurrence insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our insurance policies may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention if our security is breached if pii or other confidential information is accessed if we fail to comply with the consent order or if we experience a catastrophic occurrence it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our current or future applications fail to perform properly our reputation could be adversely affected our market share could decline and we could be subject to liability claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our applications are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors any defects in functionality or that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in 





 

 











any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors might be substantial 

because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or to contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant furthermore the availability or performance of our applications could be adversely affected by a number of factors including customers’ inability to access the internet the failure of our network or software systems security breaches or variability in user traffic for our services we may be required to issue credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused services or otherwise be liable to our customers for damages they may incur resulting from certain of these events because of the nature of our business our reputation could be harmed as a result of factors beyond our control for example because our customers access our applications through their internet service providers if a service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our applications or otherwise experiences service outages such failure could interrupt our customers’ access to or experience with our applications which could adversely affect our reputation or our customers’ perception of our applications’ reliability or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our insurance intended to cover liability claims may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our policy may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention 

our services present the potential for identity theft embezzlement or other similar illegal behavior by our employees with respect to third parties 

the services offered by us generally require or involve collecting pii of our customers and  or their employees such as their full names birth dates addresses employer records tax information social security numbers and bank account information this information can be used by criminals to commit identity theft to impersonate third parties or to otherwise gain access to the data or funds of an individual if any of our employees take convert or misuse such pii funds or other documents or data we could be liable for damages and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed moreover if we fail to adequately prevent third parties from accessing pii andor business information and using that information to commit identity theft we might face legal liabilities and other losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our solutions and our business are subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations including those regarding privacy data protection and information security any failure by us or our third party service providers as well as the failure of our platform or services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations including regulation by various federal government agencies including the ftc and state and local agencies the united states and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on or requirements regarding the collection distribution use security and storage of pii of individuals and the ftc and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection use and dissemination of data selfregulatory obligations other industry standards policies and other legal obligations may apply to our collection distribution use security or storage of pii or other data relating to individuals in addition most states and some foreign governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of pii these obligations may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with one another other regulatory requirements or our internal practices any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with us eu or other foreign privacy or security laws regulations policies industry standards or legal obligations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to or acquisition release or transfer of pii may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and i nformation security in the united states canada the european union and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards may have on our business for example in may 2018 the general data protecti on regulation came into force bringing with it a complete overhaul of eu data protection laws the new rules supersede eu data protection legislation impose more stringent eu data protection requirements and provide for greater penalties for nonc ompliance changing definitions of what constitutes pii may also limit or inhibit our ability to operate or to expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data also some jurisdictions require that certai n types of data be retained on servers within these jurisdictions our failure to comply with applicable laws directives and regulations may result in enforcement action against us including fines and imprisonment and damage to our reputation any of w hich may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results further in october 2015 the european court of justice issued a ruling invalidating the useu safe harbor framework which facilitated transfers of pii to the united states in comp liance with applicable eu data protection laws in july 2016 the eu and the us political authorities adopted the euus privacy shield replacing the safe harbor framework and providing a new mechanism for companies to transfer eu pii to the un ited states us organizations wishing to selfcertify under the privacy shield must pledge their compliance with its seven core and sixteen supplemental principles which are based on european data protection law 

if our service is perceived to cause or is otherwise unfavorably associated with violations of privacy or data security requirements it may subject us or our customers to public criticism and potential legal liability public concerns regarding pii processing privacy and security may cause some of our customers’ end users to be less likely to visit their websites or otherwise interact with them if enough end users choose not to visit our customers’ websites or otherwise interact with them our customers could stop using our platform this in turn may reduce the value of our services and slow or eliminate the growth of our business existing and potential privacy laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security and increasing sensitivity of consumers to unauthorized processing of pii may create negative public reactions to technologies products and services such as ours 

evolving and changing definitions of what constitutes pii and  or “personal data” within the united states canada the european union and elsewhere especially relating to the classification of internet protocol or ip addresses machine or device identification numbers location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or to expand our business future laws regulations standards and other obligations could impair our ability to collect or to use information that we utilize to provide email delivery and marketing services to our customers thereby impairing our ability to maintain and to grow our customer base and to increase revenue future restrictions on the collection use sharing or disclosure of our customers’ data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such information may limit our ability to develop new services and features 

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign data protection regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers can use our applications to collect to use and to store pii regarding their employees independent contractors and job applicants federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted are considering adopting or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection use storage and disclosure of pii obtained from individuals the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers or to our business directly may limit the use and adoption of our applications and reduce overall demand or lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ workers to resist providing pii necessary to allow our customers to use our applications effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our applications in certain industries 

all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers’ ability to process to handle to store to use and to transmit demographic information and pii from their employees independent contractors job applicants customers and suppliers which could reduce demand for our applications the european union and many countries in europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations which may impact our ability to profitably operate in certain european countries 

further international data protection regulations trending toward increased localized data residency rules make transfers from outside the regulation’s jurisdiction increasingly complex and may impact our ability to deliver solutions that meet all customers’ needs if the processing of pii were to be further curtailed in this manner our solutions could be less effective which may reduce demand for our applications which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the pr ocessing of pii were to be curtailed in this manner our solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our applications which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure our existing customers may experience service outages and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our applications which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have experienced significant growth in the number of users transactions and data that our operations infrastructure supports we seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers we also seek to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer activations and the expansion of existing customer activations in addition we need to properly manage our technological operations infrastructure to support version control changes in hardware and software parameters and the evolution of our applications however the provision of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead time we have experienced and may in the future experience website disruptions outages and other performance problems these problems may be caused by a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors viruses security attacks fraud increased resource consumption from expansion or modification to our dayforce code spikes in customer usage and denial of service issues in some instances we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time if we do not accurately predict our infrastructure requirements our existing customers may experience service outages that may subject them to financial penalties causing us to incur financial liabilities and customer losses and our operations infrastructure may fail to keep pace with increased sales causing new customers to experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on third party service providers for many aspects of our business including but not limited to the operation of data centers the execution of automated clearing house or ach and wire transfers to support our customer payroll and tax services the monitoring of applicable laws and the printing and delivery of checks if any third party service providers on which we rely experience a disruption go out of business experience a decline in quality or terminate their relationship with us we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

we rely on third party service providers for many integral aspects of our business a failure on the part of any of our third party service providers to fulfill their contracts with us could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation we depend on our third parties for many services including but not limited to 

upkeep of data centers 

we host dayforce and powerpay applications and serve all of our customers from data centers operated by third party providers primarily navisite in boston massachusetts redhill england santa clara california toronto canada vancouver canada woking england sydney australia london england and oregon we also host dayforce australia in microsoft azure in melbourne australia and sydney australia while we control and have access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our external data centers we do not control the operation of these facilities the owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all these parties may also seek to cap their maximum contractual liability resulting in us being financially responsible for losses caused by their actions or omissions additionally we host our internal systems through data centers that we operate and lease or own in atlanta georgia fountain valley california louisville kentucky and st petersburg florida if we are unable to renew our agreements with our third party providers or to renew our leases on commercially reasonable terms or if one of our data center operators is acquired we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with any such transfer both our third party data centers and data centers that we lease and operate are subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct any such acts could result in a breach of the security of our or our customers’ data 

 

 

problems faced by our third party data center locations  with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers including us could adversely affect the experience of our customers our third party data centers operators could decide to close their facilities without adequate notice in addition any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy faced by our third party data centers operators or any of the service providers with whom we or they contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict additionally if our data centers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity this could adversely affect the growth of our bus iness any changes in third party service levels at our data centers or any security breaches errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our applications could adversely affect our reputation damage our customers’ stored files resu lt in lengthy interruptions in our services or otherwise result in damage or losses to our customers for which they may seek compensation from us interruptions in our services might reduce our revenues cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services subject us to potential liability or adversely affect our renewal rates 

processing of electronic funds transfers

we currently have agreements with four banks in the united states two banks in canada and one financial payments company in the united kingdom to execute electronic funds transfers to support our customer payroll and tax services in the united states canada and the united kingdom if one or more of these parties fails to process electronic funds transfers on a timely basis or at all then our relationship with our customers could be harmed and we could be subject to claims by a customer with respect to the failed transfers with little or no recourse to the banks in addition these parties have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and transferring to alternative providers could prove timeconsuming and costly if these parties terminate their relationships with us restrict or fail to increase the dollar amounts of funds that they will process on behalf of our customers their doing so may impede our ability to process funds and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

check printing and delivery 

in canada we rely on a third party vendor to print payroll checks and in canada and the united states we rely on third party couriers such as federal express and purolator to ship printed reports yearend slips and pay checks to our customers relying on third party check printers and couriers puts us at risk from disruptions in their operations such as employee strikes inclement weather and their ability to perform tasks on our behalf if these vendors fail to perform their tasks we could incur liability or suffer damages to our reputation or both if we are forced to use other third party couriers transferring to these competitor couriers could prove timeconsuming our costs could increase and we may not be able to meet shipment deadlines moreover we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we currently use which could further increase our costs 

monitoring of changes to applicable laws 

we and our third party providers must monitor for any changes or updates in laws that are applicable to the solutions that we or our third party providers provide to our customers in addition we are reliant on our third party providers to modify the solutions that they provide to our customers to enable our clients to comply with changes to such laws and regulations if our third party providers fail to reflect changes or updates in applicable laws in the solutions that they provide to our customers we could be subject to negative customer experiences harm to our reputation loss of customers claims for any fines penalties or other damages suffered by our customers and other financial harm 

a failure on the part of any of our third party service providers could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to develop or to sell our existing cloud solutions into new markets or to further penetrate existing markets our revenue may not grow as expected 

our ability to increase revenue will depend in large part on our ability to sell our existing cloud solutions into new markets around the world to further penetrate our existing markets and to increase sales from existing customers who do not utilize the full dayforce suite the success of any enhancement or new solution or service depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of enhanced or new solutions the ability to maintain and to develop relationships with third parties and the ability to attract to retain and to effectively train sales and marketing personnel any new solutions we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or costeffective manner and may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue any new markets in which we attempt to sell our 

 

 

platform and solutions including new countries or regions may not be receptive additionally any expansion into new markets will require commensurate ongoing expansion of our monitoring of local laws and regulations which increases our costs as well as the risk of the product not incorporating in a timely fashion or at all the necessary changes to enable a customer to be compliant with such laws our a bility to further penetrate our existing markets depends on the quality of our platform and solutions and our ability to design our cloud solutions to meet consumer demand and our ability to increase sales from existing customers depends on our customers ’ satisfaction with our product and need for additional solutions if we are unable to sell our cloud solutions into new markets or to further penetrate existing markets or to increase sales from existing customers our revenue may not grow as expected w hich could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

because a growing part of our business consists of sales of applications to manage complex operating environments for our customers we may experience longer sales cycles and longer deployments some customers demand more configuration and integration services and require increased compliance and initial support costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period 

a growing portion of our customer base requires applications that manage complex operating environments our ability to increase revenues and to maintain profitability depends in large part on widespread acceptance of our applications by businesses and other organizations as we target our sales efforts at these customers we face greater costs longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales for some of our customers the customer’s decision to use our applications may be an enterprisewide decision and therefore these types of sales require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our applications our typical sales cycles for dayforce range from three to twelve months and we expect that this lengthy sales cycle may continue or increase as customers adopt our applications longer sales cycles could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period 

it typically takes approximately three to nine months to implement a new customer on dayforce depending on the number and type of applications the complexity and scale of the customers’ business the configuration requirements and other factors many of which are beyond our control although our contracts are generally noncancellable by the customer at any given time a significant percentage of our customers may be still in the process of deploying our applications particularly during periods of rapid growth some customers may opt for phased roll outs which further lengthens the time for us to see profits from such contracts 

some of our customers may demand more configuration and integration services which increase our upfront investment in sales and deployment efforts additionally customers may require increased compliance and initial support costs during the onboarding process as a result of these factors we must devote a significant amount of sales support and professional services resources to individual customers increasing the cost and time required to complete sales the increased costs associated with completing sales and the implementation process for these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our customers are not satisfied with the implementation and professional services provided by us or our partners it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on our ability to implement our solutions on a timely accurate and costefficient basis and to provide professional services demanded by our customers implementation and other professional services may be performed by our own staff by a third party or by a combination of the two although we perform the majority of our implementations and other professional services with our staff in some instances we work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of certain services to our customers in 2019 we used third parties to assist us in approximately 20 of our implementation services if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the implementation or type of professional services or applications delivered or there are inaccuracies or errors in the work delivered by the third party then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with such services could damage our ability to expand the number of applications subscribed to by that customer or we could be liable for loss or damage suffered by the customer as a result of such third party’s actions or omissions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if a new customer is dissatisfied with professional service either performed by us or a third party the customer could refuse to golive which could result in a delay in our collection of revenue or could result in a customer seeking repayment of its implementation fees or suing us for damages or could force us to enforce the termination provisions in our customer contracts in order to collect revenue in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may affect our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers which could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

the los s of a significant portion of our customers or a failure to renew our subscription agreements with a significant portion of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of a significant portion of our customers or a failure of some of them to renew their contracts with us could have a significant impact on our revenues reputation and our ability to obtain new customers our agreements with our dayforce customers are typically structured as having an initial fixed term of between three and five years with evergreen renewal thereafter consequently our customers may choose to terminate their agreements with us at any time after the expiration of the initial term by providing us with the amount of written notice stipulated in the agreement moreover acquisitions of our customers could lead to cancellation of our contracts with them or by the acquiring companies thereby reducing the number of our existing and potential customers acquisitions of our partners involved in referring or reselling our solutions could also result in a reduction in the number of our current and potential customers as our partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our applications a failure to retain a significant portion of our customers or a failure to renew our subscription agreements with a significant portion of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may pay employees and taxing authorities amounts due for a payroll period before a customer’s electronic funds transfers are settled with finality to our trust account or we may make erroneous payments to employees taxing authorities or other entities if customer payments are rejected by banking institutions or otherwise fail to clear into our trust accounts or if erroneous payments are not quickly resolved we may require additional sources of shortterm liquidity which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our payroll processing business involves the movement of significant funds from the account of a customer to employees and to relevant taxing authorities we debit a customer’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf under certain circumstances funds previously credited to our trust account could be reversed after our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities we also face the risk that an erroneous payment instruction may trigger duplicate payments to payroll customers there is therefore a risk that the employer’s funds will be insufficient to cover the amounts we have already paid on its behalf while such funding shortage or erroneous payments and accompanying financial exposure has only occurred in limited instances in the past should customers default on their payment obligations in the future or should erroneous payment recovery be unsuccessful we may be required to advance substantial amounts of funds to cover such obligations in such an event we may be required to seek additional sources of shortterm liquidity which may not be available on reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further should a customer whose funds are reversed subsequently have financial difficulty collection of the funds advanced by us on its behalf may be difficult 

our customers may fail to pay us in accordance with the terms of their agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our agreements with our dayforce customers are typically structured as having an initial fixed term of between three and five years with evergreen renewal thereafter if customers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements with them we may be unable to collect amounts due and may be required to incur additional costs enforcing the terms of our contracts including litigation the risk of such negative effects increases with the term length of our customer arrangements furthermore some of our customers may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us or to pay those amounts more slowly if our customers fail to pay us in accordance with the terms of their agreements it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we often provide service level commitments under our customer contracts if we fail to meet these contractual commitments we could be considered to have breached our contractual obligations be obligated to provide credits or refund prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face contract terminations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customer agreements typically provide service level commitments which are measured on a monthly or other periodic basis if we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our applications we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with service credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or we could face contract claims for damages or terminations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our revenues could be significantly affected if we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes under our agreements with our customers any extended service outages could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

any failure to offer highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

once our applications are deployed our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory requirements placed on our software and services could impose increased costs on us delay or prevent our introduction of new products and services and impair the function or value of our existing products and services 

our products and services may become subject to increasing regulatory requirements and as these requirements proliferate we may be required to change or adapt our products and services to comply changing regulatory requirements might render our products and services obsolete or might block us from developing new products and services this might in turn impose additional costs upon us to comply or to further develop our products and services it might also make introduction of new products and services more costly or more timeconsuming than we currently anticipate and could even prevent introduction by us of new products or services or cause the continuation of our existing products or services to become more costly accordingly such regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

customers depend on our products and services to enable them to comply with applicable laws which requires us and our third party providers to constantly monitor applicable laws and to make applicable changes to our solutions if our solutions have not been updated to enable the customer to comply with applicable laws or we fail to update our solutions on a timely basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

customers rely on our solutions to enable them to comply with payroll hr and other applicable laws for which the solutions are intended for use changes in tax benefit and other laws and regulations could require us to make significant modifications to our products or to delay or to cease sales of certain products which could result in reduced revenues or revenue growth and our incurring substantial expenses and writeoffs there are thousands of jurisdictions and multiple laws in some or all of such jurisdictions which may be relevant to the solutions that we or our third party providers provide to our customers therefore we and our third party providers must monitor all applicable laws and as such laws expand evolve or are amended in any way and when new regulations or laws are implemented we may be required to modify our solutions to enable our customers to comply which requires an investment of our time and resources although we believe that our cloud platform provides us with flexibility to release updates in response to these changes we cannot be certain that we will be able to make the necessary changes to our solutions and release updates on a timely basis or at all in addition we are reliant on our third party providers to modify the solutions that they provide to our customers as part of our solutions to comply with changes to such laws and regulations the number of laws and regulations that we are required to monitor will increase as we expand the geographic region in which the solutions are offered when a law changes we must then test our solutions to meet the requirements necessary to enable our customers to comply with the new law if our solutions fail to enable a customer to comply with applicable laws we could be subject to negative customer experiences harm to our reputation or loss of customers claims for any fines penalties or other damages suffered by our customer and other financial harm additionally the costs associated with such monitoring implementation of changes are significant if our solutions do not enable our customers to comply with applicable laws and regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally if we fail to make any changes to our products as described herein which are required as a result of such changes to or enactment of any applicable laws in a timely fashion we could be responsible for fines and penalties implemented by governmental and regulatory bodies if we fail to provide contracted services such as processing w2 tax forms or remitting taxes in accordance with deadlines set by law our customers could incur fines penalties interest or other damages which we could be responsible for paying our payment of fines penalties interest or other damages as a result of our failure to provide compliance services prior to deadlines may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

 

we operate and are subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions audits investigations and tax proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations an d financial condition 

we are subject to income and nonincome taxes in multiple jurisdictions income tax accounting often involves complex issues and judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we are regularly subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax reserves as well as our future tax liabilities in addition the application of withholding tax value added tax goods and services tax sales tax and other nonincome taxes is not always clear and we may be subject to audits relating to such withholding or nonincome taxes we believe that our tax positions are reasonable and our tax reserves are adequate to cover any potential liability however tax authorities in these jurisdictions may challenge our position if any of these tax authorities successfully challenge our positions we may be liable for additional tax penalties and interest in excess of any reserves established which may have a significant impact on our results and operations and future cash flow 

sales to customers outside the united states or with international operations expose us to risks inherent in international sales 

approximately 30 of our revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 was obtained from companies headquartered outside of the united states primarily from canada which accounted for 299 306 and 306 of our revenue in such periods respectively our ceridian canada ltd “ceridian canada” operations provide certain hcm solutions for our canadian customers we are continuing to expand our international cloud solutions into other countries as such our international operations are subject to risks that could adversely affect those operations or our business as a whole including 































in addition we anticipate that customers and potential customers may increasingly require and demand that a single vendor provide hcm solutions and services for their employees in a number of countries if we are unable to provide the required services on a multinational basis there may be a negative impact on our new orders and customer retention which would negatively impact revenue and earnings although we have a multinational strategy additional investment and efforts may be necessary to implement such strategy some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks

some of our applications include software covered by open source licenses which may include by way of example gnu general public license and the apache license the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our applications by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner in the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code to reengineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise to be limited in the licensing of our technologies each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and services in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we employ third party software for use in or with both our applications and our internal operations and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our applications including dayforce incorporate certain third party software obtained under licenses from other companies additionally we are reliant on third party software licenses for our internal operational applications we anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third party software and development tools from third parties in the future although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third party software we currently license this may not always be the case or it may be difficult or costly to replace and our failure to migrate off end of life software may significantly impact our customer’s ability to operate in addition integration of the software used in our applications and in our operations with new third party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources also our use of additional or alternative third party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties 

additionally if the quality of our third party software declines the overall quality of our products may be negatively impacted to the extent that our applications depend upon the successful operation of third party software in conjunction with our software any undetected errors or defects in this third party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications delay new application introductions and result in a failure of our applications which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

changes in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the inter net infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our applications and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business applications federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications in order to comply with these changes in addition government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet these laws or charges could limit the growth of internetrelated commerce or communications generally resulting in reductions in the demand for internetbased applications such as ours any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the use of the internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity security reliability cost ease of use accessibility and quality of service the performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by “viruses” “worms” and similar malicious programs and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure if the use of the internet is adversely affected by these issues demand for our applications could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

customer funds that we hold in trust are subject to market interest rate credit and liquidity risks the loss of these funds could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we invest funds held in trust for our customers in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our customer fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or in unison during periods of unusual financial market volatility in the event of a global financial crisis such as that experienced in 2008 we could be faced with a severe constriction of the availability of liquidity which could impact our ability to fund payrolls any loss of or inability to access customer funds could have an adverse impact on our cash position and results of operations and could require us to obtain additional sources of liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are required to collect sales and use taxes in additional jurisdictions we might be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our customers which could increase the costs of our services and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the application of federal state and local tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving new income sales use or other tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time possibly with retroactive effect and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the internet these enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

in addition existing tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be interpreted changed modified or applied adversely to us possibly with retroactive effect which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts 

for example we might lose sales or incur significant expenses if states successfully impose broader guidelines on state sales and use taxes a successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect sales or other taxes on the licensing of our software or provision of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past transactions and otherwise harm our business each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time we review these rules and regulations periodically and when we believe we are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state we may voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with that state’s rules and regulations there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we currently believe no such taxes are required 

 

 

vendors of services like us are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes if one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have but have not been paid with respect to our services we might be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward liability for past taxes might also include substantial interest and penalty charges our customers are typically wholly responsible for applicable sales and similar taxes nevertheless customers might be reluctant to pay back taxes and might refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes if we are required to collect and to pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial moreover imposition of such taxes on us going forward will effectively increase th e cost of our software and services to our customers and might adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed 

we have underfunded pension plan liabilities we will require current and future operating cash flow to fund these shortfalls we have no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy these obligations 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering employees who meet age and service requirements while our us pension plans have been closed and frozen our net pension liability and cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the longevity and actuarial profile of our plan participants the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the actual and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets assets available to fund the pension and other postemployment benefit obligations of our plans as of december 31 2019 were approximately 4256 million or approximately 1370 million less than the measured pension and postretirement benefit obligation on a gaap basis in addition any changes in the discount rate could result in a significant increase or reduction in the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following years similarly changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost in the following years 

our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

as a public company we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm if we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated the process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with section 404 is challenging and costly in the future we may not be able to complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion 

in the third quarter of 2019 we identified a material weakness related to an isolated service incident that resulted in duplicate payments for certain of our us payroll customers as a result we determined that our controls to detect duplicate payments were ineffective as a result of this material weakness we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of september 30 2019 we subsequently implemented additional monitoring controls to detect and to prevent duplicate payments in advance of funding and remediation was considered fully complete as of december 31 2019 in 2017 we identified a material weakness related to our assessment of valuation allowance and classification of deferred tax liabilities associated with intangible assets for 2016 and prior periods and considered it remediated as of december 31 2017 we may identify additional material weaknesses in internal controls in future periods if we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or if we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to adequately remediate any material weaknesses that are identified we may be unable to report our financial information accurately on a timely basis may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules may breach the covenants under our credit facilities and incur additional costs there could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our consolidated financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

we may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2019 we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2031 and 2020 for federal and state purposes respectively these net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an “ownership change” a section 382 “ownership change” generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5 of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling threeyear period similar rules may apply under state tax laws future issuances of our stock could cause an “ownership change” it is possible that an ownership change or any future ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability 

 

changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could have a material adverse effect on our previously reported results of operations 

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and to interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our previously reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change please refer to part ii item 8 note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” of this report for our assessment of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

risks related to our indebtedness

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash transfers in the form of intercompany loans and receivables from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason also could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us 

our outstanding indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to operate our business and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2019 consisted of i a senior term loan in the original principal amount of 6800 million and ii a 3000 million committed revolving facility the senior credit facilities are secured substantially by all of our assets the senior term loan has a maturity date of april 30 2025 and the revolving facility has a maturity date of april 30 2023 as of december 31 2019 we had 6715 million outstanding principal under our senior term loan and no principal outstanding under our revolving facility 

our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have important consequences for us including without limitation that 









 

 





under the terms of the agreements governing our senior credit facilities we are required to comply with specified operating covenants and under certain circumstances a financial covenant applicable to the revolving facility which may limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it for example the obligations under the senior credit facilities may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default including without limitation payment defaults crossdefaults to certain material indebtedness covenant defaults material inaccuracy of representations and warranties bankruptcy events material judgments material defects with respect to guarantees and collateral and change of control if not cured an event of default could result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable which would require us among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness to sell selected assets andor to reduce or to delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and any such financing or refinancing might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations or are forced to take additional measures to be able to service our indebtedness it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

despite our substantial indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 

we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our senior credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we can incur in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial for example pursuant to incremental facilities under the senior credit facilities we may incur up to i an aggregate amount equal to the greater of x 1250 million and y 100 of ebitda as defined in the agreements governing the senior credit facilities of additional secured or unsecured debt plus ii an unlimited additional amount of secured or unsecured debt subject to compliance with certain leveragebased tests as described in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase 

restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

the agreements governing our senior credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests these include covenants restricting among other things our and our subsidiaries’ ability 























 

 

the agreements governing senior credit facilities contains a financial covenant applicable only to the revolving facility which requires that we maintain a ratio of consolidated first lien debt to e bitda with certain adjustments as set forth in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities  below a specified level on a quarterly basis however such requirement is applicable at the end of a fiscal quarter only if more than 35 of the revolvi ng facility with an exclusion for certain letters of credit is drawn at the end of such fiscal quarter our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet that rati o the covenant did not apply as of december 31 2019  but there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with such covenant in the future a breach of any covenant or restriction contained in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities could result in a default under those agreements if any such default occurs a majority of the lenders under the senior credit facilities or in the case of the financial covenant described above a majority of the lenders under the revolving facility may elect after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senio r term loan and revolving facility also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings further following an event of default under the agreements governing our senior credit facilit ies the administrative agent on behalf of the secured parties under the senior credit facilities will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt if the debt under the senior term loan or revolving facility was to be accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt or any other debt that may become due as a result of that acceleration 

in the future we may be dependent upon our lenders for financing to execute our business strategy and to meet our liquidity needs if our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or we are unable to borrow it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

during periods of volatile credit markets there is risk that lenders even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices could fail or refuse to honor their legal commitments and obligations under existing credit commitments including but not limited to extending credit up to the maximum amount permitted by the revolving facility if our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their revolving credit commitments or we are unable to borrow it could be difficult to obtain sufficient funding to execute our business strategy or to meet our liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt may be downgraded which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a reduction in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our short and longterm debt may negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

volatility and weakness in bank and capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs for us 

banking and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption if the disruption in these markets is prolonged our ability to refinance and the related cost of refinancing some or all of our debt could be adversely affected although we currently can access the bank and capital markets there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for us these factors including the tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain costeffective financing increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets also could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to obtain financing in addition the adoption of new statutes and regulations the implementation of recently enacted laws or new interpretations or the enforcement of older laws and regulations applicable to the financial markets or the financial services industry could result in a reduction in the amount of available credit or an increase in the cost of credit disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect our lenders insurers customers and other counterparties any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the interest rates of our term loans are priced using a spread over libor 

libor the london interbank offered rate is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the london interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally we typically use libor as a reference rate in the term loans and revolving loans made under our credit facilities such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to a term loan or revolving loan extended to us under our credit facilities is calculated using the libor rate plus an applicable spread above libor 

 

 

on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether or not libor will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 if libor ceases to be available we are entitled to negoti ate with the administrative agent under our credit facilities to amend the governing credit agreement to establish a successor benchmark rate that is generally accepted by the syndicated loan market for loans denominated in us dollars if lenders holding more than a majority of the loans and commitments under our credit facilities have not objected to the proposed successor benchmark rate within five business days following the date on which the related amendment is posted for review by the lenders the a mendment will be deemed to have been approved by the lenders and may become effective at this time due to a lack of consensus as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternati ves on our liquidity interest expense or the value of the term loans or revolving loans 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock may be volatile and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

securities markets worldwide have experienced in the past and are likely to experience in the future significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our results of operations the trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors including among other things the risk factors described herein and other factors beyond our control factors affecting the trading price of our common stock could include 





































 

 





these and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our common stock to fluctuate substantially which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock sometimes have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock securities litigation against us regardless of the merits or outcome could result in substantial costs and divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

future sales of our common stock or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

as of february 25 2020 there were 144710100 shares of our common stock outstanding additionally as of december 31 2019 we have 32868404 registered shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans of which options to purchase 13213218 shares of common stock and 819818 restricted stock units representing 14033036 shares of common stock are outstanding we cannot predict the effect if any that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that those sales will occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline of the 144386618 shares of common stock outstanding 45002305 shares are restricted securities within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 or rule 701 we have granted customary demand and piggyback registration rights to our financial sponsors and certain of our other stockholders party to the registration rights agreement with us our financial sponsors include affiliates and coinvestors of thomas h lee partners lp “thl’ and cannae holdings inc “cannae” should thl and cannae or any other stockholders further exercise their registration rights the shares registered would no longer be restricted securities and would be freely tradable in the open market 

claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us 

our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers in each case to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law pursuant to our charter our directors will not be liable to the company or any stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty except i for acts that breach his or her duty of loyalty to the company or its stockholders ii for acts or omissions without good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of the law iii pursuant to section 174 of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” or iv for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit the bylaws also require us if so requested to advance expenses that such director or officer incurred in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action suit or proceeding provided that such person will return any such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification by us any claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us 

we are party to a voting agreement with thl and cannae which provides thl and cannae with rights to nominate a number of designees to our board 

in connection with the initial public offering “ipo” we entered into a voting agreement with thl and cannae pursuant to the voting agreement for so long as thl and cannae collectively hold 50 or more of the then outstanding voting power then thl and cannae shall have the power to designate a total of five directors to the board after thl and cannae cease to collectively hold 50 or more of the then outstanding voting power then each of thl and cannae will be able to in their own right designate four directors for so long as it holds at least 40 of the then outstanding voting power three directors for so long as it holds at least 30 of the then outstanding voting power two directors for so long as it holds at least 20 of the then outstanding voting power and one director for so long as it holds at least 10 of the then outstanding voting power as of february 25 2020 cannae held at least 10 of the outstanding voting power and can designate one director to the board the voting agreement will terminate as to each of thl and cannae when they are no longer entitled to designate a director to the board and will terminate upon the time when neither is entitled to designate a director to the board additionally in the event a lender forecloses on any shares of our common stock pledged in connection with any loan advances or extensions of credit that cannae may enter into it could have an effect on thl and cannae’s ability to designate directors under the voting agreement 

 

 

t he voting agreement grants thl and cannae the right to determine the total number of directors during the term of the voting agreement thl and cannae could use this provision to maintain a majority representation even though they collectively hold less than 50 of the outstanding voting power by decreasing the size of the board thl and cannae may have a right to designate a majority of our board under the present board composition even though they collectively or individually hold less than 50 of our then outstanding voting power finally purs uant to the voting agreement for so long as each of thl and cannae are entitled to designate a director to the board thl and cannae will be required to vote all of their shares and take all other necessary actions to cause the board to include the indi viduals designated as directors by thl and cannae as applicable as a result it is possible that the interests of thl and cannae may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders 

because we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future investors may not receive any return on investment unless they are able to sell common stock for a price greater than the purchase price 

we have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future consequently stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment we do not intend in the foreseeable future to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any for the foreseeable future to repay indebtedness and to support our general corporate purposes therefore you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value there is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors have purchased their shares however the payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board subject to applicable law and will depend on among other things our earnings financial condition capital requirements level of indebtedness statutory and contractual restrictions that apply to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board deems relevant as a consequence of these limitations and restrictions we may not be able to make the payment of dividends on our common stock 

antitakeover protections in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws or our contractual obligations may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions contained in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as provisions of the dgcl could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market value of our common stock even if it would benefit our stockholders 

in addition our board has the authority to cause us to issue without any further vote or action by the stockholders up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock par value 001 per share in one or more series to designate the number of shares constituting any series and to fix the rights preferences privileges and restrictions thereof including dividend rights voting rights rights and terms of redemption redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the adoption of a stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares 

in addition under the agreements governing our senior credit facilities a change of control would cause us to be in default in the event of a change of control default the administrative agent under our senior credit facilities would have the right or at the direction of lenders holding a majority of the loans and commitments under our senior credit facilities the obligation to accelerate the outstanding loans and to terminate the commitments under our senior credit facilities and if so accelerated we would be required to repay all of our outstanding obligations under our senior credit facilities in addition from time to time we may enter into contracts that contain change of control provisions that limit the value of or even terminate the contract upon a change of control these change of control provisions may discourage a takeover of our company even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders

overview 

ceridian is a global hcm software company we categorize our solutions into two categories cloud and bureau solutions cloud revenue is generated from hcm solutions that are delivered via two cloud offerings dayforce our flagship cloud hcm platform and powerpay a cloud hr and payroll solution for the canadian small business market we also continue to support customers using our bureau solutions which we generally stopped actively selling to new customers following the acquisition of dayforce in 2012 we invest in maintenance and necessary updates to support our bureau customers and continue to migrate them to dayforce 

dayforce provides hr payroll benefits workforce management and talent management functionality our platform is used by organizations regardless of industry or size to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle including attracting engaging paying deploying and developing their people dayforce was built as a single application from the ground up that combines a modern consumergrade user experience with proprietary application architecture including a single employee record and a rules engine spanning all areas of hcm dayforce provides continuous realtime calculations across all modules to enable for example payroll administrators access to data through the entire pay period and managers access to realtime data to optimize work schedules our platform is designed to make work life better for our customers and their employees by improving hcm decisionmaking processes streamlining workflows revealing strategic organizational insights and simplifying legislative compliance the platform is designed to ease administrative work for both employees and managers creating opportunities for companies to increase employee engagement we are a founderled organization and our culture combines the agility and innovation of a startup with a history of deep domain and operational expertise 

we sell dayforce through our direct sales force on a subscription peremployee permonth “pepm” basis our subscriptions are typically structured with an initial fixed term of between three and five years with evergreen renewal thereafter dayforce can serve customers of all sizes ranging from 100 to over 100000 employees we have rapidly grown the dayforce platform to more than 4350 live dayforce customers representing approximately 39 million active global users as of december 31 2019 in 2019 we added over 640 net new live dayforce customers our customers vary across industries and no single customer constituted more than 1 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 we have experienced significant cloud revenue growth at scale particularly from dayforce which has grown at a compound annual growth rate “cagr” of more than 50 since 2012 our annual cloud revenue retention rate continues to exceed 95 due to our focus on solving complex problems and our superior customer experience 

the following table presents dayforce revenue by quarter from 2012 to 2019 

 

 

our business model 

our business model focuses on supporting the rapid growth of dayforce and maximizing the lifetime value of our dayforce customer relationships due to our subscription model where we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period and our high customer retention rates we have a high level of visibility into our future revenues the profitability of a customer to our business depends in large part on how long they have been a customer because in our current business model pepm subscription fees are not charged until the customer goes live and because we incur costs in advance of receiving pepm revenue that are not offset by our implementation fees we estimate that it takes approximately 2 years before we are able to recover our implementation customer acquisition and other direct costs on a new dayforce customer contract 

over the lifetime of the customer relationship we have the opportunity to realize additional pepm revenue both as the customer grows or rolls out the dayforce solution to additional employees and also by selling additional functionality to existing customers that do not currently utilize our full platform we also incur costs to manage the account to retain customers and to sell additional functionality these costs however are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire and to implement the customer 

how we assess our performance 

in assessing our performance we consider a variety of performance indicators in addition to revenue and net income set forth below is a description of our key performance measures 

 



 





live dayforce customers 

we use the number of customers live on dayforce as an indicator of future revenue and the overall performance of the business and to assess the performance of our implementation services as shown in the following table the number of customers live on dayforce has increased from 482 as of december 31 2012 to 4363 as of december 31 2019 in addition we had approximately 500 net new dayforce customers contracted but not yet live on dayforce as of december 31 2019 we expect the majority of these dayforce customers to be taken live in 2020 for 2019 our 4363 live dayforce customers represented approximately 39 million active global users 

as our business and gotomarket strategy continues to evolve in 2019 we modified our customer segmentation for increased relevance the dayforce customer data disclosed below has been updated to reflect this new customer segmentation for all periods presented we market dayforce to customers of all sizes including small under 500 employees major 500 to 5999 employees and enterprise 6000 or more employees for 2019 small businesses accounted for 12 of the total number of active global users major businesses accounted for 52 of the total number of active global users and enterprise businesses accounted for 36 of the total number of active global users 

from 2018 to 2019 live dayforce customers increased from 3718 to 4363 a net increase of 645 of the customers taken live during 2019 72 represented net new customers to dayforce and the remainder were migration customers from our bureau solution of the net new customers to dayforce small businesses accounted for 11 of the total number of active global users major businesses accounted for 49 of the total number of active global users and enterprise businesses accounted for 40 of the total number of active global users of the migration customers small businesses accounted for 15 of the total number of active global users major businesses accounted for 56 of the total number of active global users and enterprise businesses accounted for 29 of the total number of active global users 

 

 

from 2017 to 2018  live dayforc e customers increased from 3001 to 3 718  a n et increase of 717  of the customers taken live during 201 8  77  represented net new customers to dayforce and the remainder were migration customers from our bureau solutions of the net new cu stomers to dayforce small businesses accounted for 9  of the total number of active global users  major businesses accounted for 57  of the total number of active global users  and enterprise businesses accounted for 34  of the total number of active global users  of the migration customers small businesses accounted for 2 3  of the total number of active global users  major businesse s accounted for 64  of the total number of active global users  and enterprise businesses accounted for 13  of the total number of active global users  

the following table sets forth the number of live dayforce customers at the end of the years presented 

 

 

annual cloud revenue retention rate 

our annual cloud revenue retention rate measures the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing cloud customers we use this retention rate as an indicator of customer satisfaction and future revenues we calculate the annual cloud revenue retention rate as a percentage where the numerator is the cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year less the cloud annualized recurring revenue from lost cloud customers during that year and the denominator is the cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year our annual cloud revenue retention rate has been 95 or above for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 we set annual targets for cloud revenue retention rate and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis by reviewing known and anticipated customer losses our cloud revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the mix of cloud solutions used by customers the level of customer satisfaction and changes in the number of users live on our cloud solutions 

cloud annualized recurring revenue “arr” 

we derive the majority of our cloud revenues from recurring fees primarily pepm subscription charges we also derive recurring revenue from fees related to the rental and maintenance of clocks charges for onceayear services such as yearend tax statements and investment income on our customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities customer employees or other third parties to calculate cloud arr we start with recurring revenue at year end subtract the onceayear charges annualize the revenue for customers live for less than a full year to reflect the revenue that would have been realized if the customer had been live for a full year and add back the onceayear charges we set annual targets for cloud arr and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis 

constant currency revenue 

we present revenue on a constant currency basis to assess how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations we believe this nongaap financial measure is useful to management and investors we have calculated revenue on a constant currency basis by applying a fixed rate of 130 canadian dollar to 100 us dollar foreign exchange rate to revenues originally booked in canadian dollars for all applicable historical periods please refer to the “nongaap measures” section for additional information on our constant currency revenue

 

 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin nongaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance adjusted ebitda is a component of our management incentive plan and adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations sponsor management fees noncash charges for asset impairments gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary sharebased compensation expense and related employer taxes severance charges restructuring consulting fees transaction costs and certain other nonrecurring charges adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage that adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations please refer to the “results of operations” section below for a discussion of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

our history 

ceridian was acquired in 2007 by affiliates and coinvestors of thl and cannae in april 2012 ceridian acquired dayforce corporation which had built dayforce a cloud hcm solution in the months following the acquisition dayforce founder david d ossip was named chief executive officer of ceridian hcm and shortly thereafter we generally stopped actively selling our bureau solutions to new customers in the united states to focus our resources on expanding the dayforce platform and growing cloud solutions for each quarter since september 30 2016 our cloud revenue has surpassed our bureau revenue cloud revenue grew from 41 of total revenue during the quarter ended december 31 2015 to 83 of total revenue during the quarter ended december 31 2019 

 

as part of our strategy to focus on the growth of our cloud solutions business we undertook the following initiatives to simplify our business model











as a result of these transactions we primarily sell dayforce and powerpay which we believe simplifies our business model and positions us well for continued growth

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from equity offerings as of december 31 2019 we had cash and equivalents of 2813 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of 3000 million no cash amounts were drawn on the revolving credit facility during 2019 our total debt balance was 6839 million as of december 31 2019 please refer to note 10 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt

our primary liquidity needs are related to funding of general business requirements including the payment of interest and principal on our debt capital expenditures pension contributions and product development 

our customer trust funds are held and invested with the primary objectives being to protect the principal balance and to ensure adequate liquidity to meet cash flow requirements in accordance with these objectives we maintain approximately 47 of customer trust funds in liquidity portfolios with maturities ranging from one to 120 days consisting of highquality bank deposits money market mutual funds commercial paper or collateralized shortterm investments and we maintain on average approximately 53 of customer trust funds in fixed income portfolios with maturities ranging from 120 days to 10 years consisting of us treasury and agency securities canada government and provincial securities as well as highly rated assetbacked mortgagebacked municipal corporate and bank securities to maintain sufficient liquidity in the trust to meet payment obligations we also have financing arrangements and may pledge fixed income securities for shortterm financing the assets held in trust are intended for the specific purpose of satisfying client fund obligations and therefore are not freely available for our general business use 

we believe that our cash flow from operations availability under our revolving credit facility and available cash and equivalents will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity it will be funded through the issuance of equity the incurrence of additional indebtedness or a combination thereof we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms or at all additionally our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and to fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance which is subject to general economic financial and other factors that are beyond our control accordingly we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs although we have no specific current plans to do so if we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions which would result in additional expenses or dilution 

 

statements of cash flows 

changes in cash flows due to purchases of customer trust fund marketable securities and proceeds from the sale or maturity of customer trust fund marketable securities as well as the carrying value of customer trust fund accounts as of period end dates can vary significantly due to several factors including the specific day of the week the period ends which impacts the timing of funds collected from customers and payments made to satisfy customer obligations to employees taxing authorities and others the customer trust funds are fully segregated from our operating cash accounts and are evaluated and tracked separately by management therefore we have provided the table below excluding the cash flows and restricted cash and equivalents held within our customer trust funds to provide supplemental information regarding the cash flows related to our core

backlog is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations which represents contracted revenue for recurring services and fixed price professional services primarily implementation services that has not yet been recognized including deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods please refer to note 13 “revenue” to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our remaining performance 

seasonality 

we have in the past and expect in the future to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and new customer contracts with the fourth quarter historically being our strongest quarter for new customer contracts renewals and customer golives although the growth of our cloud solutions and the ratable nature of our fees makes this seasonality less apparent in our overall results of operations we expect our revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the fourth and first quarters of each year fourth quarter revenue is driven by yearend processing fees and dayforce customer golives and first quarter revenue is driven by revenue earned for printing of yearend tax packages 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019 we did not have any “offbalance sheet arrangements” as such term is defined in item 303 of regulation sk

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements and related notes requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our actual results may differ from these estimates 

please refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” for a description of our significant accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and that require the most complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below 

 

revenue recognition 

the core principle of asc topic 606 is that revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services in accordance with asc topic 606 we perform the following steps to determine revenue to be recognized











the significant majority of our two major revenue sources recurring and professional services and other are derived from contracts with customers recurring revenues are primarily related to our cloud subscription performance obligations professional services and other revenues are primarily related to professional services for our cloud customers including implementation services to activate new accounts as well as postgo live professional services typically billed on a time and materials basis and to a much lesser extent fees for other nonrecurring services including sales of time clocks and certain client reimbursable outofpocket expenses fees charged to cloud subscription performance obligations are generally priced either on a peremployee permonth “pepm” basis for a given month or on a peremployee perprocess basis for a given process both based on usage and fees charged for professional services are typically priced on a fixed fee basis for activating new accounts and on a time and materials basis for post golive professional services 

our recurring cloud subscription performance obligations are generally priced based on the number of active customer employees as of the signing of the contract at the contract pepm rate over the initial contract term our professional services are generally based on a fixed fee charged to our customers for activating new accounts and on a time and materials basis for post golive professional services there is typically no variable consideration related to our recurring cloud subscriptions or our activation services nor do they include a significant financing component noncash consideration or consideration payable to a customer our recurring cloud subscriptions are typically billed one month in advance while our professional services are billed over the implementation period for activation of new accounts and as work is performed for post golive professional services

our cloud services arrangements include multiple performance obligations and transaction price allocations are based on the standalone selling price ssp for each performance obligation our contract renewal rates serve as an observable input to establish ssp for our recurring cloud subscription performance obligations the ssp for professional services performance obligations is estimated based on market conditions and observable inputs including rates charged by third parties to perform implementation services

for our performance obligations the consideration allocated to cloud subscription revenues is recognized as recurring revenues typically commencing with the date the customer processes their first live payroll using the solution referred to as the golive date the consideration allocated to professional services to activate a new account is recognized as professional services revenues based on the proportion of total work performed using reasonably dependable estimates in relation to progression through the implementation phase by solution

nongaap measures 

constant currency revenue 

the following tables set forth certain information regarding our revenue on a constant currency basis for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 we present revenue on a constant currency basis to assess how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations we have calculated revenue on a constant currency basis by applying a fixed planning rate of 130 canadian dollar to 100 us dollar foreign exchange rate to revenue originally booked in canadian dollars for all applicable periods 

 



 

 



 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin

we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin nongaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance adjusted ebitda is a component of our management incentive plan and adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations sponsor management fees noncash charges for asset impairments gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary sharebased compensation expense and related employer taxes severance charges restructuring consulting fees transaction costs and certain other nonrecurring charges adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the control of operating management 

our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit loss net income loss earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by similar items to those eliminated in this presentation adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are included in this discussion because they are key metrics used by management to assess our operating performance 

 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not defined under gaap are not measures of net income operating i ncome or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap and are subject to important limitations our use of the terms adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 















in evaluating adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation 

the following table reconciles operating profit to adjusted ebitda for the periods presented 

 



 















 

the following tables present a reconciliation of our reported results to our nongaap adjusted ebitda basis for all periods presented 

 



 



 



 



 

 



 



 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and pension obligations we seek to minimize or manage these market risks through normal operating and financing activities we do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the market fluctuations nor do we use instruments where there are not underlying exposures 

foreign currency risk  our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar due to the relative size of our international operations to date we have not instituted an active hedging program we expect our international operations to continue to grow in the near term and we are monitoring the foreign currency exposure to determine if we should begin a hedging program 

interest rate risk  in connection with our us and canadian payroll and tax filing services we collect funds for payment of payroll and taxes temporarily hold such funds in trust until payment is due remit the funds to the customers’ employees and appropriate taxing authority file federal state and local tax returns and handle related regulatory correspondence and amendments we invest the us customer trust funds primarily in high quality bank deposits money market mutual funds or collateralized shortterm investments we may also invest these funds in us treasury and agency securities as well as highly rated assetbacked mortgagebacked municipal and corporate securities our canadian customer trust funds are invested in securities issued by the government and provinces of canada highly rated canadian banks and corporations assetbacked trusts and mortgages 

we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary 

we do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

pension obligation risk  we provide a pension plan for a number of former employees in applying relevant accounting policies we have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets discount rates and health care cost trends the cost of pension benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets assumptions for future periods contributions and benefit experience in 2019 we contributed 180 million to our pension plan 

the effective discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations in 2019 ranged from 252 to 281 the expected rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2019 was 600 the following table reflects the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes 

 



 

 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with acco untants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2019 based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2019 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level

managements report on internal control over financial reporting

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on the assessment management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2019 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting which appears in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

changes in internal control over financial reporting

in the third quarter of 2019 we identified a material weakness related to an isolated service incident that resulted in duplicate payments for certain of our us payroll customers as a result we determined that our controls to detect duplicate payments were ineffective as a result of this material weakness we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of september 30 2019 we subsequently implemented additional monitoring controls to detect and to prevent duplicate payments in advance of funding and remediation was considered fully complete as of december 31 2019

except for the remediated material weakness discussed above there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15d and 15d15d of the exchange act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2019 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level however our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1a ris k factors 

risks related to our business and industry 

we have a history of losses and negative cash flows from operating activities and we may not be able to attain or to maintain profitability or positive cash flows from operating activities in the future 

we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities over the last few years as we made substantial investments in developing launching and selling our cloud solutions in addition our highly leveraged capital structure has had a negative effect on our profitability as a result we have incurred net losses of 929 million in the year ended december 31 2016 92 million in the year ended december 31 2017 and 634 million in the year ended december 31 2018 as of december 31 2018 we had an accumulated deficit of 4193 million we incurred negative cash flows from operating activities of 755 million in the year ended december 31 2016 398 million in the year ended december 31 2017 and positive cash flows from operating activities of 95 million in the year ended december 31 2018 to the extent we are successful in increasing our cloud customer base we may also incur increased net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities because costs associated with acquiring and implementing new cloud customers are generally incurred up front while subscription revenues are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements our recent growth in revenues may not be indicative of our future performance 

we also expect our expenses to increase in the future due to anticipated increases in sales general and administrative expenses including expenses associated with being a public company and product development and management expenses which could impact our ability to achieve or to sustain profitability or positive cash flows from operating activities in the future additionally while the majority of our revenue comes from fees charged for use of the software we are developing new products and services which may initially have a lower profit margin than our existing cloud solutions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we believe we will be able to reach profitability and attain positive cash flows from operating activities in the next few years we cannot provide any assurance that we will able to do so in the future 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include breadth and depth of product functionality scalability and reliability of applications robust workforce management comprehensive tax services modern and innovative cloud technology platforms combined with an intuitive user experience multicountry and jurisdiction domain expertise in payroll and hcm quality of implementation and customer service integration with a wide variety of third party applications and systems total cost of ownership and roi brand awareness and reputation pricing and distribution we face a variety of competitors some of which are longestablished providers of hcm solutions many of our current and potential competitors are larger have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do and are able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products and services some of our competitors could offer hcm solutions bundled as part of a larger product offering furthermore our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or to withstand substantial price competition in addition many of our competitors have established marketing relationships access to larger customer bases and major distribution agreements with consultants system integrators and resellers our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product offerings or resources 

in order to capitalize on customer demand for cloud applications legacy vendors are modernizing and expanding their applications through cloud acquisitions and organic development legacy vendors may also seek to partner with other leading cloud hcm providers we also face competition from vendors selling custom software and point solutions some of which offer cloud solutions our competitors include without limitation adp ultimate software and workday for hcm kronos for workforce management and cornerstone ondemand for talent management in addition other companies such as netsuite and microsoft that provide cloud applications in different target markets may develop applications or acquire companies that operate in our target markets and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal applications some large businesses may be hesitant to adopt cloud applications such as ours and prefer to upgrade the more familiar applications offered by these vendors that are deployed onpremise such as oracle and sap our competitors could offer hcm solutions on a standalone basis at a low price or bundled as part of a larger product sale with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants competition could intensify in the future 

 

 

if our competitors’ products services or technologies become more accepted than our applicat ions if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours or if their products or services are more technologically capable than ours it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our competitors may offer their products and services at a lower price if we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels or if we experience significant pricing pressures it could have a material adverse ef fect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy has focused on developing our cloud solutions which have experienced rapid revenue growth in recent periods that has been offset by revenue declines in our bureau solutions if we fail to manage our growth effectively or if our strategy is not successful we may be unable to execute our business plan to maintain high levels of service or to adequately address competitive challenges 

we have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our operations related to our cloud solutions in particular our recurring services revenue for our cloud solutions has continued to increase while our recurring services revenue for our bureau solutions has continued to decline as we implement our growth strategy for our cloud solutions we will continue to migrate employees and resources from our bureau solutions to our cloud solutions additionally we are continuing to invest in the infrastructure shared by our bureau and cloud solutions although we are no longer marketing our bureau solutions to new customers the growth of our cloud solutions has placed and future growth will place a significant strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure in order to manage this growth effectively we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures failure to effectively manage growth and failure to achieve our growth strategy could result in difficulty or delays in implementing customers declines in quality or customer satisfaction increases in costs difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties and any of these difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our bureau solutions which comprise a significant portion of our revenue may decline at a rate faster than we anticipate and we may not be able to successfully migrate our bureau customers to our cloud solutions or to offset the decline in bureau revenue with cloud revenue 

our growth strategy is focused on the growth and expansion of our cloud solutions however a portion of our revenue continues to be derived from our bureau customers we generally ceased marketing our bureau solutions to new customers in the united states in 2012 and since that time have maintained the bureau applications for existing customers while migrating customers to our cloud solutions maintenance of our bureau business requires investment specifically with respect to compliance updates and security controls if our investments are not sufficient to adequately update our bureau solutions such solutions may lose market acceptance and we may face security vulnerabilities 

in addition we have marketed our cloud solutions to our bureau customers and some of our bureau customers have migrated to our cloud solutions but there is no guarantee that our remaining bureau customers will migrate to our cloud solutions if such bureau customers do not migrate we may lose them in the future or we may be required to make ongoing investments to serve a smaller pool of customers if our revenue from our bureau solutions declines at a rate faster than anticipated we are required to make significant investments in infrastructure shared by our bureau and cloud solutions that are not offset by increased revenue we are not able to successfully convert the remaining bureau customers to our cloud solutions or our cloud solutions revenue does not grow fast enough to offset the decline in our bureau solutions revenue it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

if the market for enterprise cloud computing develops slower than we expect or declines it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the enterprise cloud computing market is not as mature as the market for onpremise enterprise software and it is uncertain whether cloud computing will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud computing in general and of hcm solutions in particular many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloud computing it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our applications the future growth rate and size of the cloud computing market or the entry of competitive applications the expansion of the cloud computing market depends on a number of factors including the cost performance and perceived value associated with cloud computing as well as the ability of cloud computing companies to address security and privacy concerns if we or other cloud computing providers experience security incidents loss of customer data disruptions in delivery or other problems the market for cloud computing applications as a whole including our applications may be negatively affected if cloud computing does not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for cloud computing caused by a lack of customer acceptance technological challenges weakening economic conditions security or privacy concerns competing technologies and products reductions in corporate spending or otherwise it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our revenues from our cloud solutions have grown substantially over the last few years our efforts to increase use of our cloud solutions and our other applications may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate 

our revenues from our cloud solutions have grown substantially over the last few years our total cloud revenues grew from 2978 million in 2016 to 4043 million in 2017 and 5343 million in 2018 a growth rate of 358 and 322 respectively any factor adversely affecting sales of our cloud solutions including application release cycles delays or failures in new product functionality market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition and economic and market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our participation in new markets for native payroll and application expansion in succession management learning management and compensation management is relatively new and it is uncertain whether these areas will ever result in significant revenues for us further the entry into new markets or the introduction of new features functionality or applications beyond our current markets and functionality may not be successful 

our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business 

our quarterly results of operations including the levels of our revenues gross margin profitability cash flow and deferred revenue may vary significantly in the future and periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful accordingly the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control and as a result may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the value of our common stock factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include without limitation 



























 

 











if we are not able to provide new or enhanced functionality and features or keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards we will not be able to remain competitive and the demand for our services will likely decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by changes due to rapid technological advances additional qualification requirements related to technological challenges and evolving industry standards and changes in the regulatory and legislative environment our future success will depend upon our ability to anticipate and to adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and to effectively develop to introduce to market and to gain broad acceptance of new product and service enhancements incorporating the latest technological advancements we may not be able to successfully provide new or enhanced functionality and features for our existing solutions that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments for example we are focused on enhancing the features and functionality of our hcm solutions to enhance their utility for larger customers with complex dynamic and global operations the success of new or enhanced functionality and features depends on several factors including their overall effectiveness and the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the enhancements new features or applications failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth in addition because our solutions are designed to operate on a variety of systems we will need to continuously modify and enhance our solutions to keep pace with changes in internetrelated hardware ios and other software and communication browser and database technologies we may not be successful in developing these new or enhanced functionality and features or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion if we do not continue to innovate and to deliver highquality technologically advanced products and services we will not remain competitive which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore uncertainties about the timing and nature of new functionality or new functionality to existing platforms or technologies could increase our research and development expenses any failure of our applications to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our applications result in customer dissatisfaction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

an information security breach of our systems or the loss of or unauthorized access to customer information the failure to comply with the us federal trade commission’s “ftc” ongoing consent order regarding data protection or a system disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business market brand financial condition and results of operations 

our business is dependent on our payroll transaction financial accounting and other data processing systems we rely on these systems to process on a daily and time sensitive basis a large number of complicated transactions we electronically receive process store and transmit data and personally identifiable information “pii” about our customers and their employees as well as our vendors and other business partners including names social security numbers and checking account numbers we keep this information confidential however our websites networks applications and technologies and other information systems may be targeted for sabotage disruption or data misappropriation the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of pii and other customer and individual information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business while we have information security and business continuity programs these plans may not be sufficient to ensure the uninterrupted operation of our systems or to prevent unauthorized access to the systems by unauthorized third parties because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures these concerns about information security are increased with the mounting sophistication of social engineering our network security hardening may be bypassed by phishing and other social engineering techniques that seek to use end user behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into our systems which might disrupt our delivery of services and make them unavailable and might also result in the disclosure or misappropriation of pii or other confidential or sensitive information in addition a significant cyber security breach could prevent or delay our ability to process payment transactions 

 

 

any information security breach in our business processes or of our processing systems has the potential to impact our customer information and our financial reporting capabilities which could result in the potential loss of business and our ability to ac curately report financial results if any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time we could potentially miss a critical filing period resulting in potential fees and penalties or lose control of custom er data all of which could result in financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to customers regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external envi ronment increasingly hostile to information security if our security measures are breached as a result of third party action employee or subcontractor error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to customer data  our reputation may be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability we may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period of time techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabo tage systems change frequently and are growing increasingly sophisticated as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls throughout the company despite these efforts it is possible that our security controls over data training and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of pii or other confidential information any issue of data privacy as it relates to unauthorized access to or loss of customer andor employee information could result in the potential loss of business damage to our market reputation litigation and regulatory investigation and penalties for example in december 2009 a criminal hacked into our discontinued us payroll application following receipt of an “access letter” in may 2010 from the ftc for a nonpublic review of the matter we worked with the ftc and entered into a twentyyear consent order which became final in june 2011 we conceded no wrongdoing in the order and we were not subject to any monetary fines or penalties however in connection with the order we are required to among other things maintain a comprehensive information security program that is reasonable and appropriate for our size and complexity and for the type of pii we collect we are also required to have portions of our security program which apply to certain segments of our us business reviewed by an independent third party on a biennial basis maintaining updating monitoring and revising an information security program in an effort to ensure that it remains reasonable and appropriate in light of changes in security threats changes in technology and security vulnerabilities that arise from legacy systems is timeconsuming and complex and is an ongoing effort 

there may be other such security vulnerabilities that come to our attention the independent third party that reviews our security program pursuant to the ftc consent order may determine that the existence of vulnerabilities in our security controls or the failure to remedy them in a timeframe they deem appropriate means that our security program does not provide a reasonable level of assurance that the security confidentiality and integrity of pii is protected by ceridian or that there was a failure to protect at some point in the reporting period while we have taken and continue to take steps to ensure compliance with the consent order if we are determined not to be in compliance with the consent order or if any new breaches of security occur the ftc may take enforcement actions or other parties may initiate a lawsuit any such resulting fines and penalties could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial results and any reputational damage therefrom could adversely affect our relationships with our existing customers and our ability to attain new customers our continued investment in the security of our technology systems continued efforts to improve the controls within our technology systems business processes improvements and the enhancements to our culture of information security may not successfully prevent attempts to breach our security or unauthorized access to pii or other confidential sensitive or proprietary information in addition in the event of a catastrophic occurrence either natural or manmade our ability to protect our infrastructure including pii and other customer data and to maintain ongoing operations could be significantly impaired our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies may not be successful in mitigating the effects of a catastrophic occurrence insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition our insurance policies may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit regardless of its merit could be costly and divert management’s attention if our security is breached if pii or other confidential information is accessed if we fail to comply with the consent order or if we experience a catastrophic occurrence it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our services present the potential for identity theft embezzlement or other similar illegal behavior by our employees with respect to third parties 

the services offered by us generally require or involve collecting pii of our customers and  or their employees such as their full names birth dates addresses employer records tax information social security numbers and bank account information this information can be used by criminals to commit identity theft to impersonate third parties or to otherwise gain access to the data or funds of an individual if any of our employees take convert or misuse such pii funds or other documents or data we could be liable for damages and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed moreover if we fail to adequately prevent third parties from accessing pii andor business information and using that information to commit identity theft we might face legal liabilities and other losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

our solutions and our business are subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations including those regarding privacy data protection and information security any failure by us or our third party service providers as well as the failure of our platform or services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations including regulation by various federal government agencies including the ftc and state and local agencies the united states and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on or requirements regarding the collection distribution use security and storage of pii of individuals and the ftc and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection use and dissemination of data selfregulatory obligations other industry standards policies and other legal obligations may apply to our collection distribution use security or storage of pii or other data relating to individuals in addition most states and some foreign governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of pii these obligations may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with one another other regulatory requirements or our internal practices any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with us eu or other foreign privacy or security laws regulations policies industry standards or legal obligations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to or acquisition release or transfer of pii may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the united states canada the european union and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards may have on our business for example in may 2018 the general data protection regulation came into force bringing with it a complete overhaul of eu data protection laws the new rules supersede eu data protection legislation impose more stringent eu data protection requirements and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance changing definitions of what constitutes pii may also limit or inhibit our ability to operate or to expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data also some jurisdictions require that certain types of data be retained on servers within these jurisdictions our failure to comply with applicable laws directives and regulations may result in enforcement action against us including fines and imprisonment and damage to our reputation any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results further in october 2015 the european court of justice issued a ruling invalidating the useu safe harbor framework which facilitated transfers of pii to the united states in compliance with applicable eu data protection laws in july 2016 the eu and the us political authorities adopted the euus privacy shield replacing the safe harbor framework and providing a new mechanism for companies to transfer eu pii to the united states us organizations wishing to selfcertify under the privacy shield must pledge their compliance with its seven core and sixteen supplemental principles which are based on european data protection law 

if our service is perceived to cause or is otherwise unfavorably associated with violations of privacy or data security requirements it may subject us or our customers to public criticism and potential legal liability public concerns regarding pii processing privacy and security may cause some of our customers’ end users to be less likely to visit their websites or otherwise interact with them if enough end users choose not to visit our customers’ websites or otherwise interact with them our customers could stop using our platform this in turn may reduce the value of our services and slow or eliminate the growth of our business existing and potential privacy laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security and increasing sensitivity of consumers to unauthorized processing of pii may create negative public reactions to technologies products and services such as ours 

evolving and changing definitions of what constitutes pii and  or “personal data” within the united states canada the european union and elsewhere especially relating to the classification of internet protocol or ip addresses machine or device identification numbers location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or to expand our business future laws regulations standards and other obligations could impair our ability to collect or to use information that we utilize to provide email delivery and marketing services to our customers thereby impairing our ability to maintain and to grow our customer base and to increase revenue future restrictions on the collection use sharing or disclosure of our customers’ data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such information may limit our ability to develop new services and features 

 

 

privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign data protection regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and res ults of operations 

our customers can use our applications to collect to use and to store pii regarding their employees independent contractors and job applicants federal state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted are considering adopting or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection use storage and disclosure of pii obtained from individuals the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers or to our business directly may limit the use and adoption of our applications and reduce overall demand or lead to significant fines penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws furthermore privacy concerns may cause our customers’ workers to resist providing pii necessary to allow our customers to use our applications effectively even the perception of privacy concerns whether or not valid may inhibit market adoption of our applications in certain industries 

all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers’ ability to process to handle to store to use and to transmit demographic information and pii from their employees independent contractors job applicants customers and suppliers which could reduce demand for our applications the european union and many countries in europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations which may impact our ability to profitably operate in certain european countries 

further international data protection regulations trending toward increased localized data residency rules make transfers from outside the regulation’s jurisdiction increasingly complex and may impact our ability to deliver solutions that meet all customers’ needs if the processing of pii were to be further curtailed in this manner our solutions could be less effective which may reduce demand for our applications which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us if the processing of pii were to be curtailed in this manner our solutions would be less effective which may reduce demand for our applications which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on third party service providers for many aspects of our business including but not limited to the operation of data centers the execution of automated clearing house or ach and wire transfers to support our customer payroll and tax services the monitoring of applicable laws and the printing and delivery of checks if any third party service providers on which we rely experience a disruption go out of business experience a decline in quality or terminate their relationship with us we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

we rely on third party service providers for many integral aspects of our business a failure on the part of any of our third party service providers to fulfill their contracts with us could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation we depend on our third parties for many services including but not limited to 

upkeep of data centers 

we host dayforce and powerpay applications and serve all of our customers from data centers operated by third party providers primarily navisite in boston massachusetts redhill england santa clara california toronto canada vancouver canada and woking england we also host dayforce australia in microsoft azure in melbourne australia and sydney australia while we control and have access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our external data centers we do not control the operation of these facilities the owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all these parties may also seek to cap their maximum contractual liability resulting in us being financially responsible for losses caused by their actions or omissions additionally we host our internal systems through data centers that we operate and lease or own in atlanta georgia fountain valley california louisville kentucky st petersburg florida and winnipeg canada if we are unable to renew our agreements with our third party providers or to renew our leases on commercially reasonable terms or if one of our data center operators is acquired we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with any such transfer both our third party data centers and data centers that we lease and operate are subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct any such acts could result in a breach of the security of our or our customers’ data 

 

 

problems faced by our third party data center locations with the telecommunications network pr oviders with whom we or they contract or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers including us could adversely affect the experience of our customers our third party data centers operators could decide to close their facilities without adequate notice in addition any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy faced by our third party data centers operators or any of the service providers with whom we or they contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict additionally if our data centers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity this could adversely affect the growth of our business any changes in third party servic e levels at our data centers or any security breaches errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our applications could adversely affect our reputation damage our customers’ stored files result in lengthy interruptions in our servi ces or otherwise result in damage or losses to our customers for which they may seek compensation from us interruptions in our services might reduce our revenues cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services subjec t us to potential liability or adversely affect our renewal rates 

processing of electronic funds transfers

we currently have agreements with three banks in the united states two banks in canada and one financial payments company in the united kingdom to execute electronic funds transfers to support our customer payroll and tax services in the united states canada and the united kingdom if one or more of these parties fails to process electronic funds transfers on a timely basis or at all then our relationship with our customers could be harmed and we could be subject to claims by a customer with respect to the failed transfers with little or no recourse to the banks in addition these parties have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and transferring to alternative providers could prove timeconsuming and costly if these parties terminate their relationships with us restrict or fail to increase the dollar amounts of funds that they will process on behalf of our customers their doing so may impede our ability to process funds and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

check printing and delivery 

in canada we rely on a third party vendor to print payroll checks and in canada and the united states we rely on third party couriers such as federal express and purolator to ship printed reports yearend slips and pay checks to our customers relying on third party check printers and couriers puts us at risk from disruptions in their operations such as employee strikes inclement weather and their ability to perform tasks on our behalf if these vendors fail to perform their tasks we could incur liability or suffer damages to our reputation or both if we are forced to use other third party couriers transferring to these competitor couriers could prove timeconsuming our costs could increase and we may not be able to meet shipment deadlines moreover we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we currently use which could further increase our costs 

monitoring of changes to applicable laws 

we and our third party providers must monitor for any changes or updates in laws that are applicable to the solutions that we or our third party providers provide to our customers in addition we are reliant on our third party providers to modify the solutions that they provide to our customers to enable our clients to comply with changes to such laws and regulations if our third party providers fail to reflect changes or updates in applicable laws in the solutions that they provide to our customers we could be subject to negative customer experiences harm to our reputation loss of customers claims for any fines penalties or other damages suffered by our customers and other financial harm 

a failure on the part of any of our third party service providers could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to develop or to sell our existing cloud solutions into new markets or to further penetrate existing markets our revenue may not grow as expected 

our ability to increase revenue will depend in large part on our ability to sell our existing cloud solutions into new markets around the world to further penetrate our existing markets and to increase sales from existing customers who do not utilize the full dayforce suite the success of any enhancement or new solution or service depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of enhanced or new solutions the ability to maintain and to develop relationships with third parties and the ability to attract to retain and to effectively train sales and marketing personnel any new solutions we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or costeffective manner and may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue any new markets in which we attempt to sell our 

 

 

platform and solutions including new countries or regions may not be receptive additionally any expansion into new markets will require commensurate ongoing expansion of our monitoring of local laws and regulations which increases our costs as well as the risk of the product not incorporating in a timely fashion or at all the necessary changes to enable a customer to be compliant with such laws our ability t o further penetrate our existing markets depends on the quality of our platform and solutions and our ability to design our cloud solutions to meet consumer demand and our ability to increase sales from existing customers depends on our customers’ satisf action with our product and need for additional solutions if we are unable to sell our cloud solutions into new markets or to further penetrate existing markets or to increase sales from existing customers our revenue may not grow as expected which cou ld have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

because a growing part of our business consists of sales of applications to manage complex operating environments for our customers we may experience longer sales cycles and longer deployments some customers demand more configuration and integration services and require increased compliance and initial support costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in a given period

the application of federal state and local tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving new income sales use or other tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time possibly with retroactive effect and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the internet these enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

in addition existing tax laws statutes rules regulations or ordinances could be interpreted changed modified or applied adversely to us possibly with retroactive effect which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts 

for example we might lose sales or incur significant expenses if states successfully impose broader guidelines on state sales and use taxes a successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect sales or other taxes on the licensing of our software or provision of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past transactions and otherwise harm our business each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time we review these rules and regulations periodically and when we believe we are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state we may voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with that state’s rules and regulations there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we currently believe no such taxes are required 

 

 

vendors of services like us are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes if one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have but have not been paid with respect to our services we might be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward liability for past taxes might also include substantial interest and penalty charges our custom ers are typically wholly responsible for applicable sales and similar taxes nevertheless customers might be reluctant to pay back taxes and might refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes if we are required to collect a nd to pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial moreover imposition of such taxes on us go ing forward will effectively increase the cost of our software and services to our customers and might adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed 

we have underfunded pension plan liabilities we will require current and future operating cash flow to fund these shortfalls we have no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy these obligations 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering employees who meet age and service requirements while our us pension plans have been closed and frozen our net pension liability and cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations the longevity and actuarial profile of our plan participants the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the actual and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets particularly equity securities or in a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets assets available to fund the pension and other postemployment benefit obligations of our plans as of december 31 2018 were approximately 3816 million or approximately 1626 million less than the measured pension and postretirement benefit obligation on a gaap basis in addition any changes in the discount rate could result in a significant increase or reduction in the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following years similarly changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost in the following years 

our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are required pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year beginning after the effective date of our ipo and in each year thereafter our auditors will also need to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future to the extent we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined by the jobs act and are not a smaller reporting company in 2017 we identified a material weakness related to our assessment of valuation allowance and classification of deferred tax liabilities associated with intangible assets for 2016 and prior periods we remediated the material weakness and did not have a material weakness in connection with the 2017 audit however we cannot guarantee that we will not have additional material weaknesses in the future if we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or if we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we may be unable to report our financial information accurately on a timely basis may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules may breach the covenants under our credit facilities and incur additional costs there could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have and will continue to incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company 

as a publicly traded company we have incurred and will continue to incur additional legal accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur in the past and will incur additional expenses after we cease to be an emerging growth company to the extent that we take advantage of certain exceptions from reporting requirements that are available under the jobs act as an emerging growth company we are required to file with the sec annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in section 13 of the exchange act we also are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements including the requirements of the new york stock exchange the “nyse” the toronto stock exchange the “tsx” and certain provisions of the sarbanesoxley act and the regulations promulgated thereunder which will impose additional compliance obligations upon us among other things as a public company 





 

 







these changes require a commitment of additional resources and many of our competitors already comply with these obligations we may not be successful in implementing these requirements and the commitment of resources required for implementing them could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the changes necessitated by becoming a public company require a significant commitment of resources and management oversight that has increased and may continue to increase our costs and could place a strain on our systems and resources as a result our management’s attention might be diverted from other business concerns if we are unable to offset these costs through other savings then it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are an “emerging growth company” and have elected and may elect to continue to comply with certain of the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies which could make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an emerging growth company and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved in addition even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to continue to rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 

we will remain an emerging growth company until december 31 2023 or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceeds 107 billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule 12b2 under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds 7000 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than 10 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding threeyear period whether or not issued in a registered offering 

we may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018 we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2031 and 2019 for federal and state purposes respectively these net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an “ownership change” a section 382 “ownership change” generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5 of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling threeyear period similar rules may apply under state tax laws future issuances of our stock could cause an “ownership change” it is possible that an ownership change or any future ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability 

 

 

 

changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could have a material adverse effect on our previously reported results of operations 

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and to interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our previously reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 

in may 2014 the fasb issued new revenue recognition guidance under accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning after december 31 2017 under this new guidance revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services the new guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized in order to be able to comply with the requirements of asu 201409 beginning in the first quarter of 2019 we need to update and to enhance our internal accounting systems processes and our internal controls over financial reporting this has required and will continue to require additional investments by us and may require incremental resources and system configurations that could increase our operating costs in future periods if we are not able to properly implement asu 201409 in a timely manner the revenue that we recognize and the related disclosures that we provide under asu 201409 may not be complete or accurate and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations in a timely manner we have completed our evaluation and implementation plan for adoption of this new guidance and will be adopting the new standard effective first quarter of 2019 

risks related to our indebtedness

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash transfers in the form of intercompany loans and receivables from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason also could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us 

our outstanding indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to operate our business and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2018 consisted of i a senior term loan in the original principal amount of 6800 million and ii a 3000 million committed revolving facility the senior credit facilities are secured substantially by all of our assets the senior term loan has a maturity date of april 30 2025 and the revolving facility has a maturity date of april 30 2023 as of december 31 2018 we had 6783 million outstanding principal under our senior term loan and no principal outstanding under our revolving facility 

our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have important consequences for us including without limitation that 













 

 

under the terms of the agreements governing our senior credit facilities we are required to comply with specified operating covenants and under certain circumstances a financial covenant applica ble to the revolving facility which may limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it for example the obligations under the senior credit facilities may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default including w ithout limitation payment defaults crossdefaults to certain material indebtedness covenant defaults material inaccuracy of representations and warranties bankruptcy events material judgments material defects with respect to guarantees and collatera l and change of control if not cured an event of default could result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable which would require us among other things to seek additional financ ing in the debt or equity markets to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness to sell selected assets andor to reduce or to delay planned capital or operating expenditures such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to serv ice our debt and any such financing or refinancing might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations or are forced to take additional measures to be able to service our indebtedness it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

despite our substantial indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 

we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our senior credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we can incur in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial for example pursuant to incremental facilities under the senior credit facilities we may incur up to i an aggregate amount equal to the greater of x 1250 million and y 100 of ebitda as defined in the agreements governing the senior credit facilities of additional secured or unsecured debt plus ii an unlimited additional amount of secured or unsecured debt subject to compliance with certain leveragebased tests as described in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase 

restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 

the agreements governing our senior credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests these include covenants restricting among other things our and our subsidiaries’ ability 























 

 

the agreements governing senior credit facilities cont ains a financial covenant applicable only to the revolving facility which requires that we maintain a ratio of consolidated first lien debt to ebitda with certain adjustments as set forth in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities  below a specified level on a quarterly basis however such requirement is applicable at the end of a fiscal quarter only if more than 35 of the revolving facility with an exclusion for certain letters of credit is drawn at the end of such fiscal quarter our a bility to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet that ratio the covenant did not apply as of december 31 2018  but there can be no assurance that we will be in complia nce with such covenant in the future a breach of any covenant or restriction contained in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities could result in a default under those agreements if any such default occurs a majority of the lenders under t he senior credit facilities or in the case of the financial covenant described above a majority of the lenders under the revolving facility may elect after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods to declare all outstanding borrowing s together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior term loan and revolving facility also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any com mitments they have to provide further borrowings further following an event of default under the agreements governing our senior credit facilities the administrative agent on behalf of the secured parties under the senior credit facilities will have t he right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt if the debt under the senior term loan or revolving facility was to be accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt or any other debt that may becom e due as a result of that acceleration 

in the future we may be dependent upon our lenders for financing to execute our business strategy and to meet our liquidity needs if our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or we are unable to borrow it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

during periods of volatile credit markets there is risk that lenders even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices could fail or refuse to honor their legal commitments and obligations under existing credit commitments including but not limited to extending credit up to the maximum amount permitted by the revolving facility if our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their revolving credit commitments or we are unable to borrow it could be difficult to obtain sufficient funding to execute our business strategy or to meet our liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt may be downgraded which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a reduction in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our short and longterm debt may negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

volatility and weakness in bank and capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs for us 

banking and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption if the disruption in these markets is prolonged our ability to refinance and the related cost of refinancing some or all of our debt could be adversely affected although we currently can access the bank and capital markets there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for us these factors including the tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain costeffective financing increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets also could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to obtain financing in addition the adoption of new statutes and regulations the implementation of recently enacted laws or new interpretations or the enforcement of older laws and regulations applicable to the financial markets or the financial services industry could result in a reduction in the amount of available credit or an increase in the cost of credit disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect our lenders insurers customers and other counterparties any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the interest rates of our term loans are priced using a spread over libor 

libor the london interbank offered rate is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the london interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally we typically use libor as a reference rate in the term loans and revolving loans made under our credit facilities such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to a term loan or revolving loan extended to us under our credit facilities is calculated using the libor rate plus an applicable spread above libor 

 

 

on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether or not libor will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of ca lculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 if libor ceases to be available we are entitled to negotiate with the administrative agent under our credit facilities to amend the governing credit agreement to establish a s uccessor benchmark rate that is generally accepted by the syndicated loan market for loans denominated in us dollars if lenders holding more than a majority of the loans and commitments under our credit facilities have not objected to the proposed succ essor benchmark rate within five business days following the date on which the related amendment is posted for review by the lenders the amendment will be deemed to have been approved by the lenders and may become effective at this time due to a lack o f consensus as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on our liquidity interest expense or the value of the term loans or revolving loans 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock may be volatile and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

securities markets worldwide have experienced in the past and are likely to experience in the future significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our results of operations the trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors including among other things the risk factors described herein and other factors beyond our control factors affecting the trading price of our common stock could include 































 

 











these and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our common stock to fluctuate substantially which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock in addition in the past when the market price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock sometimes have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock securities litigation against us regardless of the merits or outcome could result in substantial costs and divert the time and attention of our management from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

future sales of our common stock or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

as of february 25 2019 there were 140514889 shares of our common stock outstanding additionally as of december 31 2018 we also have 28672211 registered shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans of which options to purchase 13916146 shares of common stock and 664073 restricted stock units representing 14580219 shares of common stock are outstanding we cannot predict the effect if any that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that those sales will occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline of the 139453710 shares of common stock outstanding 96441093 shares are restricted securities within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 or rule 701 we have granted customary demand and piggyback registration rights to the sponsors and certain of our other stockholders party to the registration rights agreement with us should the sponsors or any other stockholders further exercise their registration rights the shares registered would no longer be restricted securities and would be freely tradable in the open market 

cannae holds approximately 233 of our outstanding common stock as of february 25 2019 on november 7 2018 cannae announced that one of its subsidiaries had entered into a threeyear margin loan pursuant to which it could borrow up to 3000 million the margin loan is guaranteed by cannae for a period of up to one year and is further secured by a pledge of 250 million shares of our common stock beneficially owned by cannae the loan requires that a certain loan to value ratio based on the value of the shares of our common stock pledged to secure the loan be maintained in the event that the ratio is not maintained the borrower must post additional cash collateral andor elect to repay a portion of the loan the loan also contains provisions that subject to their terms effectively require prepayment in the event of certain customary events of default including cannae’s failure to comply with specified financial ratios or the triggering of a requirement of prepayment under any other material indebtedness in the event that cannae borrows under the margin loan and there is an event of default if cannae fails to pledge additional cash collateral andor repay a portion of the loan when it is required to do so or if cannae otherwise fails to comply with the respective terms of the margin loan and the lender accelerates payment of all amounts outstanding under the loan as a result of this noncompliance then the lender could foreclose on the pledged shares and sell the shares of common stock in the open market which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition certain lenders under the margin loan may elect at any time to hedge their exposure to the shares of common stock in transactions that could directly or indirectly impact the price of our common stock

 

 

claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy succ essful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us 

our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers in each case to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law pursuant to our charter our directors will not be liable to the company or any stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty except i for acts that breach his or her duty of loyalty to the company or its stockholders ii for acts or omissions without good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of the law iii pursuant to section 174 of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” or iv for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit the bylaws also require us if so requested to advance expenses that such director or officer incurred in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action suit or proceeding provided that such person will return any such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification by us any claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us 

we have elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for publiclylisted companies which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a “controlled company” under the corporate governance rules for publiclylisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board be independent under the applicable rules of the nyse nor are we required to have a compensation committee or a corporate governance and nominating committee comprised entirely of independent directors in light of our status as a controlled company our board has established a compensation committee and a corporate governance and nominating committee that are not comprised solely of independent members we do however have a majority of independent directors serving on our board should the interests of our sponsors differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publiclylisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

we are party to a voting agreement with our sponsors which provides our sponsors with rights to nominate a number of designees to our board 

in connection with the ipo we entered into a voting agreement with thl and cannae pursuant to the voting agreement for so long as thl and cannae collectively hold 50 or more of the then outstanding voting power then thl and cannae shall have the power to designate a total of five directors to the board after thl and cannae cease to collectively hold 50 or more of the then outstanding voting power then each of thl and cannae will be able to in their own right designate four directors for so long as it holds at least 40 of the then outstanding voting power three directors for so long as it holds at least 30 of the then outstanding voting power two directors for so long as it holds at least 20 of the then outstanding voting power and one director for so long as it holds at least 10 of the then outstanding voting power the voting agreement will terminate as to each sponsor when the sponsor is no longer entitled to designate a director to the board and will terminate upon the time when neither sponsor is entitled to designate a director to the board additionally in the event a lender forecloses on any shares of our common stock pledged in connection with any loan advances or extensions of credit that cannae may enter into it could have an effect on thl and cannae’s ability to designate directors under the voting agreement 

the voting agreement grants the sponsors the right to determine the total number of directors during the term of the voting agreement the sponsors could use this provision to maintain a majority representation even if they collectively hold less than 50 of the outstanding voting power by decreasing the size of the board thl and cannae may have a right to designate a majority of our board under the present board composition even if they collectively or individually hold less than 50 of our then outstanding voting power finally pursuant to the voting agreement for so long as each sponsor is entitled to designate a director to the board the sponsors will be required to vote all of their shares and take all other necessary actions to cause the board to include the individuals designated as directors by the sponsors as applicable as a result it is possible that the interests of thl and cannae may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders 

 

 

because we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future investors may not receive any return on investment unless they are able to sell common stock for a price greater than the purchase price 

we have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future consequently stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment we do not intend in the foreseeable future to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any for the foreseeable future to repay indebtedness and to support our general corporate purposes therefore you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value there is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors have purchased their shares however the payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board subject to applicable law and will depend on among other things our earnings financial condition capital requirements level of indebtedness statutory and contractual restrictions that apply to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board deems relevant as a consequence of these limitations and restrictions we may not be able to make the payment of dividends on our common stock 

antitakeover protections in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws or our contractual obligations may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions contained in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as provisions of the dgcl could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market value of our common stock even if it would benefit our stockholders 

in addition our board has the authority to cause us to issue without any further vote or action by the stockholders up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock par value 001 per share in one or more series to designate the number of shares constituting any series and to fix the rights preferences privileges and restrictions thereof including dividend rights voting rights rights and terms of redemption redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the adoption of a stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares 

in addition under the agreements governing our senior credit facilities a change of control would cause us to be in default in the event of a change of control default the administrative agent under our senior credit facilities would have the right or at the direction of lenders holding a majority of the loans and commitments under our senior credit facilities the obligation to accelerate the outstanding loans and to terminate the commitments under our senior credit facilities and if so accelerated we would be required to repay all of our outstanding obligations under our senior credit facilities in addition from time to time we may enter into contracts that contain change of control provisions that limit the value of or even terminate the contract upon a change of control these change of control provisions may discourage a takeover of our company even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders

overview 

ceridian is a global hcm software company we categorize our solutions into two categories cloud and bureau solutions cloud revenue is generated from hcm solutions that are delivered via two cloud offerings dayforce our flagship cloud hcm platform and powerpay a cloud hr and payroll solution for the canadian small business market we also continue to support customers using our bureau solutions which we generally stopped actively selling to new customers following the acquisition of dayforce in 2012 we invest in maintenance and necessary updates to support our bureau customers and continue to migrate them to dayforce 

dayforce provides hr payroll benefits workforce management and talent management functionality our platform is used by organizations regardless of industry or size to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle including attracting engaging paying deploying and developing their people dayforce was built as a single application from the ground up that combines a modern consumergrade user experience with proprietary application architecture including a single employee record and a rules engine spanning all areas of hcm dayforce provides continuous realtime calculations across all modules to enable for example payroll administrators access to data through the entire pay period and managers access to realtime data to optimize work schedules our platform is designed to make work life better for our customers and their employees by improving hcm decisionmaking processes streamlining workflows exposing strategic organizational insights and simplifying legislative compliance the platform is designed to ease administrative work for both employees and managers creating opportunities for companies to increase employee engagement we are a founderled organization and our culture combines the agility and innovation of a startup with a history of deep domain and operational expertise 

we sell dayforce through our direct sales force on a subscription peremployee permonth “pepm” basis our subscriptions are typically structured with an initial fixed term of between three and five years with evergreen renewal thereafter dayforce can serve customers of all sizes ranging from 100 to over 100000 employees we have rapidly grown the dayforce platform to more than 3700 live dayforce customers representing approximately 31 million active global users as of december 31 2018 in 2018 we added over 715 net new live dayforce customers our customers vary across industries and no single customer constituted more than 1 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 we have experienced significant cloud revenue growth at scale particularly from dayforce which has grown at a compound annual growth rate “cagr” of more than 55 since 2012 our annual cloud revenue retention rate continues to exceed 95 due to our intense focus on solving complex problems and our superior customer experience 

the following table presents dayforce revenue by quarter from 2012 to 2018 

 

 

 

our business model 

our business model focuses on supporting the rapid growth of dayforce and maximizing the lifetime value of our dayforce customer relationships due to our subscription model where we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period and high customer retention rates we have a high level of visibility into our future revenues the profitability of a customer to our business depends in large part on how long they have been a customer because in our current business model pepm subscription fees are not charged until the customer goes live and because we incur costs in advance of receiving pepm revenue that are not offset by our implementation fees we estimate that it takes an average of 25 years before we are able to recover our implementation customer acquisition and other direct costs on a new dayforce customer contract as the proportion of dayforce customers who have been live for two or more years increases our related profitability increases the following sets forth the number of live dayforce customers at the end of each quarter presented 



over the lifetime of the customer relationship we have the opportunity to realize additional pepm revenue both as the customer grows or rolls out the dayforce solution to additional employees and also by selling additional functionality to existing customers that do not currently utilize our full platform we also incur costs to manage the account to retain customers and to sell additional functionality these costs however are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire and to implement the customer 

how we assess our performance 

in assessing our performance we consider a variety of performance indicators in addition to revenue and net income set forth below is a description of our key performance measures 

 



 





 

 

live dayforce customers 

we use the number of customers live on dayforce as an indicator of future revenue and the overall performance of the business and to assess the performance of our implementation services as shown in the following table the number of customers live on dayforce has increased from 482 as of december 31 2012 to 3718 as of december 31 2018 in addition we had over 450 net new dayforce customers contracted but not yet live on dayforce as of december 31 2018 we expect the majority of these dayforce customers to be taken live in 2019 for 2018 our 3718 live dayforce customers represented over 31 million active users we market dayforce to customers of all sizes including small under 500 employees midsized 501 to 2500 employees and enterprise over 2500 employees for 2018 small businesses accounted for 14 of the total number of active customer employees midsized businesses accounted for 32 of the total number of active customer employees and enterprise businesses accounted for 54 of the total number of active customer employees as our business and gotomarket strategy continues to evolve in 2019 we will be modifying our customer segmentation for increased relevance 

from 2017 to 2018 live dayforce customers increased from 3001 to 3718 a net increase of 717 of the customers taken live during 2018 77 represented net new customers to dayforce and the remainder were migration customers from our bureau solution of the net new customers to dayforce small businesses accounted for 9 of the total number of active customer employees midsized businesses accounted for 33 of the total number of active customer employees and enterprise businesses accounted for 58 of the total number of active customer employees of the migration customers small businesses accounted for 23 of the total number of active customer employees midsized businesses accounted for 41 of the total number of active customer employees and enterprise businesses accounted for 36 of the total number of active customer employees 

from 2016 to 2017 live dayforce customers increased from 2339 to 3001 a net increase of 662 of the customers taken live during 2017 58 represented net new customers to dayforce and the remainder were migration customers from our bureau solutions of the net new customers to dayforce small businesses accounted for 13 of the total number of active customer employees midsized businesses accounted for 33 of the total number of active customer employees and enterprise businesses accounted for 54 of the total number of active customer employees of the migration customers small businesses accounted for 20 of the total number of active customer employees midsized businesses accounted for 48 of the total number of active customer employees and enterprise businesses accounted for 32 of the total number of active customer employees 

the following table sets forth the number of live dayforce customers at the end of the years presented 

 

annual cloud revenue retention rate 

our annual cloud revenue retention rate measures the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing cloud customers we use this retention rate as an indicator of customer satisfaction and future revenues we calculate the annual cloud revenue retention rate as a percentage where the numerator is the cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year less the cloud annualized recurring revenue from lost cloud customers during that year and the denominator is the cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year our annual cloud revenue retention rate has been 95 or above for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we set annual targets for cloud revenue retention rate and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis by reviewing known and anticipated customer losses our cloud revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the mix of cloud solutions used by customers the level of customer satisfaction and changes in the number of users live on our cloud solutions 

 

 

cloud annualized recurring revenue  “ arr ”  

we derive the majority of our cloud revenues from recurring fees primarily pepm subscription charges we also derive recurring revenue from fees related to the rental and maintenance of clocks charges for onceayear services such as yearend tax statements and investment income on our customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities customer employees or other third parties to calculate cloud arr we start with recurring revenue at year end subtract the onceayear charges annualize the revenue for customers live for less than a full year to reflect the revenue that would have been realized if the customer had been live for a full year and add back the onceayear charges we set annual targets for cloud arr and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin

we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin nongaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations sponsor management fees noncash charges for asset impairments gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary sharebased compensation expense severance charges restructuring consulting fees transaction costs and environmental reserve charges adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to operating profit please see “nongaap measures” 

our history 

ceridian was acquired in 2007 by affiliates and coinvestors of the sponsors in april 2012 ceridian acquired dayforce corporation which had built dayforce a cloud hcm solution in the months following the acquisition dayforce founder david d ossip was named chief executive officer of ceridian hcm and shortly thereafter we generally stopped actively selling our bureau solutions to new customers in the united states to focus our resources on expanding the dayforce platform and growing cloud solutions for each quarter since september 30 2016 our cloud revenue has surpassed our bureau revenue cloud revenue grew from 39 of total revenue during the quarter ended december 31 2015 to 74 of total revenue during the quarter ended december 31 2018 

 

as part of our strategy to focus on the growth of our cloud solutions business we undertook the following initiatives to simplify our business model

revenue  the following table sets forth certain information regarding our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  compared with the year ended december 31 2017    

 



 



total revenue increased 756 million or 113 to 7464 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 6708 million for the year ended december 31 2017 this increase was primarily driven by an increase in cloud revenue of 1300 million or 322 from 4043 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to 5343 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the cloud revenue increase was primarily due to an increase of 1069 million or 318 in cloud recurring services revenue and 231 million or 339  in cloud professional services and other revenue the increase in cloud recurring services revenue of 1069 million was attributable to increases of 760 million from new customers addons and revenue uplift from migrations of bureau customers 229 million from the migration of bureau customers and 200 million from increased float revenue related to cloud recurring services revenue partially offset by customer attrition of 120 million the increase in cloud revenue was partially offset by a decline in bureau revenue of 544 million or 204 there was an immaterial impact on revenue due to changes in foreign currency rate fluctuations please refer to the table above for our revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis 

of the decline in bureau revenue approximately 58 was driven by customer attrition and approximately 42 was attributable to customer migrations to dayforce excluding the impact of migrations our annual bureau revenue retention rate was 869 in 2018 and 897 in 2017 for the year ended december 31 2018 recurring services revenue from payroll bureau customers accounted for 1612 million and taxonly bureau recurring services revenue accounted for 482 million the payroll bureau customers consist of approximately 15 million active users of which approximately 14 million are customers that we believe could be candidates for migration to dayforce some of our customers are not candidates to migrate to dayforce due to a variety of factors including the type of functionality that they require and their system configuration of the approximately 14 million active users that we believe could be candidates for migration to dayforce small businesses accounted for 21 of the total number of active users midsized businesses accounted for 28 of the total number of active users and enterprise businesses accounted for 51 of the total number of active users 

 

 

 

cloud revenue by solution the followi ng table presents our cloud revenue for both recurring and professional services and other for both our dayforce and powerpay solution for the periods presented 

 



 

cloud revenue was 5343 million for 2018 an increase of 322 when compared to 2017 dayforce revenue grew 385 and powerpay revenue grew 82 in 2018 as compared to 2017 there was an immaterial impact on revenue due to changes in foreign currency rate fluctuations please refer to the table above for our revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis our new business sales to dayforce and powerpay customers comprised 82 of our increase in cloud revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 and the remaining 18 consisted primarily of customer migration to dayforce from our bureau solutions as we migrate our bureau customers to dayforce we typically experience a revenue increase from such customers driven by increased product density on the dayforce platform this revenue increase can vary by customer but has been 22 on average since 2016 as measured at the time of initial migration

float revenue investment income from invested customer trust funds included in revenue was 670 million and 465 million for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively the average float balance for our customer trust funds for the year ended december 31 2018 was 33615 million compared to 32282 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the average yield was 200 during the year ended december 31 2018 an increase of 55 basis points compared to the average yield for the year ended december 31 2017 based on current investment practices an increase in market investment rates of 100 basis points would increase float revenue by approximately 17 million over the twelve months following a rate increase in addition to interest rate risks we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect customer fund balances for example a change in regulations either reducing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would reduce our average customer trust fund balances and float revenue there are no incremental costs of revenue associated with increases or declines in float revenue

recurring services cost of revenue increased by 35 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 due to additional costs incurred to support the growing dayforce customer base partially offset by reductions in costs to support our bureau customers 

the reduction in cost of revenue for professional services and other of 36 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to productivity improvements in implementing new customers

the table below presents total gross margin and solution gross margins for the periods presented

 



total gross margin is defined as total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue inclusive of product development and management costs as well as depreciation and amortization associated with cost of revenue gross margin for each solution in the table above is defined as total revenue less cost of revenue for the applicable solution as a percentage of total revenue for that related solution exclusive of any product development and management or depreciation and amortization cost allocations

the overall 113 increase in revenue outpaced the 45 increase in cost of revenue and gross profit increased by 573 million or 218 as we continued to leverage our investment in people and processes to realize economies of scale 

cloud recurring services gross margin was 682 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 628 for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase in cloud recurring services gross margin reflects an increase in the proportion of dayforce customers live for more than two years which increased from 59 as of december 31 2017 to 63 as of december 31 2018 and was also attributable to consistent configuration of new customers which enabled us to realize economies of scale in customer support and hosting costs professional services and other gross margin was 408 for the year ended december 31 2018 improving from 878 for the year ended december 31 2018 reflecting an increase in profitable post golive professional services and productivity improvements in implementing new customers 

selling general and administrative expense selling general and administrative expense increased 477 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 of the total 477 million increase 245 million was attributable to transaction expenses associated with our ipo debt refinancing and secondary offering including 113 million in sponsor management termination fees 60 million in iporelated sharebased compensation expense 37 million in other ipo transactions costs and 35 million in restructuring consulting expenses excluding transactionrelated items selling general and administrative expense increased 232 million primarily due to sales and marketing expense which increased by 134 million we continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts as we drive growth in our cloud solutions particularly in dayforce the increase in selling general and administrative expenses also reflected increases in employee related costs and increased costs associated with being a public company 

other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2018 we incurred 29 million of other income net compared to 73 million of other expense net for the year ended december 31 2017 the other income expense net for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 was primarily related to remeasurement gains and losses an intercompany payable denominated in a foreign currency which was repaid in the second quarter of 2018

operating profit  we realized operating profit of 528 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to an operating profit of 330 million for the year ended december 31 2017 excluding the impact of 245 million in transaction costs within selling general and administrative expense and 21 million in other increased sharebased compensation expense related to the ipo within cost of revenue operating profit would have been 794 million for the year ended december 31 2018 this 464 million increase was primarily due to a 756 million increase in revenue and gross margin improvement 

 

 

interest expense  net  interest expense for the year ended december 31 2018  was 832 million compared to 871 million for the year ended december 31 2017  this reduction was primarily due to the refinancing of our debt which resulted in a reduction in interest expense of 306 million upon the extinguishment of the senior notes in april 2018 representing seven fewer months of interest on the senior notes as compared to the prior year partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of 257 million as of december 3 1 2018  a 100 point basis increase in the london interbank offered rate “ libor ” rates would result in an approximately 7 million increase in our interest expense over the ensuring twelvemont h period please refer to note 9  “debt” for additional inf ormation 

income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2018 we had income tax expense of 77 million compared to income tax benefit of 496 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the 573 million increase in tax expense is primarily attributable to the 594 million tax benefit recorded during the year ended december 31 2017 reflecting the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities upon the initial implementation of the tax act

total revenue increased 474 million or 76 to 6708 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 6234 million for the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was primarily driven by an increase in cloud revenue of 1065 million or 358 from 2978 million for the year ended december 31 2016 to 4043 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the cloud revenue increase was driven by an increase of 967 million or 404 in cloud recurring services revenue and 98 million or 168 in cloud professional services and other revenue the increase in cloud recurring services revenue of 967 million was due to 680 million from new customers addons and revenue uplift from migrations of bureau customers 281 million from the migration of bureau customers 100 million from increased float revenue related to cloud recurring services revenue partially offset by customer losses of 94 million the increase in cloud revenue was partially offset by a decline in bureau recurring services revenue of 567 million or 178 

on a constant currency basis total revenue grew 68 this adjusted revenue growth was driven by an increase of 345 in cloud revenue partially offset by a decline of 186 in bureau revenue on a constant currency basis cloud revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 was driven by cloud recurring services revenue which increased by 390 and professional services and other revenue which increased by 159 as we continued to sign and to activate new customers 

of the decline in bureau revenue approximately 50 was driven by customer attrition and approximately 50 was driven by customer migrations to dayforce excluding the impact of migrations our annual bureau revenue retention rate was 897 in 2017 and 874 in 2016 for the year ended december 31 2017 recurring services revenue from payroll bureau customers accounted for 2102 million and taxonly bureau recurring services revenue accounted for 521 million the payroll bureau customers consist of approximately 19 million active users of which approximately 17 million of these active users are with customers that we believe could be candidates for migration to dayforce some of our customers are not candidates to migrate to dayforce due to a variety of factors including the type of functionality that they require and their system configuration of the approximately 17 million active users small businesses accounted for 20 of the total number of active users midsized businesses accounted for 30 of the total number of active users and enterprise businesses accounted for 50 of the total number of active users

 

 

 

cloud revenue by solution the following table presents our cloud revenue for both recurring and professional services and other for both our dayforce and powerpay solution for the periods presented 

 



 

cloud revenue was 4043 million during 2017 an increase of 358 when compared to 2016 dayforce revenue grew 461 and powerpay revenue grew 71 during 2017 as compared to 2016 our new business sales to dayforce customers comprised 74 of our increase in cloud revenue for the year ended december 31 2017 and the remaining 26 consisted primarily of customer migration to dayforce from our bureau solutions 

float revenue investment income from invested customer trust funds included in revenue was 465 million and 391 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the average float balance for our customer trust funds for the year ended december 31 2017 was 32282 million compared to 32604 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the yield was 144 during the year ended december 31 2017 an increase of 24 basis points compared to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition to interest rate risks we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect customer fund balances for example a change in regulations either reducing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would reduce our average customer trust fund balances and float revenue there are no incremental costs of revenue associated with increases or declines in float revenue 

cost of revenue  total cost of revenue for the year ended december 31 2017 was 4075 million an increase of 111 million or 28 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 

 

during 2017 we changed the presentation and classification of certain expenses within our statements of operations to better facilitate comparisons with revenue and expenses of similar businesses to better align our income statement presentation with the way management and reporting of our business has evolved internally and to enhance our overall disclosure and understanding of the business for external users we reallocated certain expenses between cost of recurring services revenue cost of professional services and other revenue and selling general and administrative expense the net impact of these reallocations was to increase total cost of revenue by 34 million and to reduce selling general and administrative expense by 34 million these changes in presentation and classification represent a change in estimate and have been accounted for on a prospective basis therefore to facilitate the discussion in this section the following table presents the actual reported costs and expenses as well as the costs and expenses on a pro forma basis as if the changes to allocation methodologies in 2017 had been in effect in 2016 

 



 

 

 

the increase in total cost of revenue for year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 included a net reallocation of 34 million from selling general and administrative expense due to a change in estimate of expense allocations excluding the effect of these reallocations total cost of revenue would have increased by 77 million or 19 

recurring services cost of revenue was reduced by 176 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this reduction included a reallocation of 315 million of costs from recurring services cost of revenue consisting primarily of 134 million in technology and facilities expenses 109 million in finance related expenses and 93 million in corporate function expenses excluding the effect of these reallocations recurring services cost of revenue would have increased by 139 million due to additional costs incurred to support the growing dayforce customer base partially offset by reductions in bureau costs 

the increase in cost of revenue for professional services and other of 202 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 included a net reallocation of 231 million of costs to professional services and other cost of revenue primarily 232 million of technology and facilities expenses excluding the effect of these reallocations professional services and other cost of revenue would have been reduced by 29 million as we achieved productivity improvements in implementing new customers 

the increase in product development and management expense of 03 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 included the reallocation of 36 million of costs to product development and management primarily 79 million in technology and facilities expenses offset by 28 million in corporate function expenses excluding the effect of these reallocations product development and management expense would have been reduced by 33 million due to reductions in product management costs associated with our bureau solution and technology expenses partially offset by higher headcount to support the continued development of the dayforce platform 

 

depreciation and amortization expense associated with cost of revenue increased by 82 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 excluding the effect of these reallocations of 82 million depreciation and amortization expense would have been consistent with 2016 

the table below presents total gross margin and solution gross margins for the periods presented both as presented and on a pro forma basis as if the changes to allocation methodologies of certain costs in 2017 discussed above had been in effect in 2016

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2017 we incurred 73 million of other expense net compared to 129 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the other expense net for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily related to foreign currency remeasurement losses on intercompany receivables or payables denominated in foreign currencies the other expense net for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily related to an impairment of 102 million to our trade name intangible asset and an increase of 59 million to our environmental reserve liability to reflect more stringent remediation requirements partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement gains on intercompany receivables or payables denominated in foreign currencies please refer to note 12 “supplementary data to statement of operations” for further discussion 

 

 

operating profit loss  we realized operating profit of 330 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to an operating loss of 112 million for the year ended december 31 2016 this 442 million increase was primarily due to a 474 million increase in revenue and gross margin improvement

quarterly results of operati ons 

the following table sets forth statements of operations data for each of the quarters presented we have prepared the quarterly statements of operations data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 

 



 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from equity offerings as of december 31 2018 we had cash and equivalents of 2178 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of 3000 million no cash amounts were drawn on the revolving credit facility during 2018 our total indebtedness was 6783 million as of december 31 2018 please refer to note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt

our primary liquidity needs are related to funding of general business requirements including the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness capital expenditures pension contributions and product development 

our customer trust funds are held and invested with the primary objectives being to protect the principal balance and to ensure adequate liquidity to meet cash flow requirements accordingly we maintain on average approximately 46 of customer trust funds in liquidity portfolios with maturities ranging from one to 120 days consisting of highquality bank deposits money market mutual funds commercial paper or collateralized shortterm investments and we maintain on average approximately 54 of customer trust funds in fixed income portfolios with maturities ranging from 120 days to 10 years consisting of us treasury and agency securities canada government and provincial securities as well as highly rated assetbacked mortgagebacked municipal corporate and bank securities to maintain sufficient liquidity in the trust to meet payment obligations we also have financing arrangements and may pledge fixed income securities for shortterm financing the assets held in trust are intended for the specific purpose of satisfying client fund obligations and therefore are not freely available for our general business use 

we believe that our cash flow from operations availability under our revolving credit facility and available cash and equivalents will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity it will be funded through the issuance of equity the incurrence of additional indebtedness or a combination thereof we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms or at all additionally our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and to fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance which is subject to general economic financial and other factors that are beyond our control accordingly we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs although we have no specific current plans to do so if we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions which would result in additional expenses or dilution 

 

statements of cash flows 

 

changes in cash flows due to purchases of customer trust fund marketable securities proceeds from the sale or maturity of customer trust fund marketable securities and the net increase decrease of restricted cash held to satisfy customer trust fund obligations as well as the carrying value of customer trust fund accounts as of period end dates can vary significantly due to several factors including the specific day of the week the period ends which impacts the timing of funds collected from customers and payments made to satisfy customer obligations to employees taxing authorities and others for example december 31 2018 was a monday when trust fund balances are generally lower whereas the last business day of 2017 was a friday when trust fund balances are generally higher the customer trust funds are fully segregated from our operating cash accounts and are evaluated and tracked separately by management therefore to provide meaningful information to the readers the following discussion is regarding the net cash flows excluding customer trust funds 

operating activities

backlog

we do not believe that any measure of backlog is a meaningful indicator of revenues that can be expected for a particular future period as the amount and timing can be influenced by multiple factors including the timing of the completion of implementation the accuracy and success of implementation services provided by us and by third parties the timing in which new customers golive and our ability to meet service level commitments 

 

seasonality 

we have in the past and expect in the future to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and new customer contracts with the fourth quarter historically being our strongest quarter for new customer contracts renewals and customer golives although the growth of our cloud solutions and the ratable nature of our fees makes this seasonality less apparent in our overall results of operations we expect our revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the fourth and first quarters of each year fourth quarter revenue is driven by yearend processing fees and dayforce customer golives and first quarter revenue is driven by revenue earned for printing of yearend tax packages 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018 we did not have any “offbalance sheet arrangements” as such term is defined in item 303 of regulation sk 

our indebtedness

the lease payments represent scheduled payments under the terms of the lease agreements we conduct substantially all of our operations in leased facilities most of these leases contain renewal options and require payments for taxes insurance and maintenance we also lease equipment for use in our business 

 

payments of retirement plan obligat ions include employer commitments to fund our defined benefit and postretirement plans and do not include estimated future benefit payments to participants expected to be made from liquidation of the assets in our defined benefit plan trusts at december 3 1 2018  our defined benefit pension plans had a projected benefit obligation that exceeded the fair value of the plans’ assets by 1458 million and our postretirement benefit plan had an accumulated benefit obligation that exceeded the fair value of the plans’ assets by 168 million we expect to satisfy these remaining obligations through investment income from and appreciation in the fair value of plan assets held in trust and from future employer contributions 

the amount of our obligation to vendors for capital expenditures at december 31 2018 was not material and no such amount is included in the table above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements and related notes requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our actual results may differ from these estimates 

please refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” for a description of our significant accounting policies the accounting policies that we believe to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and that require the most complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from the sale of our services net of applicable sales taxes when the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured we rely on a signed contract with the customer as the persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement 

we enter into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables based on the needs of our customers for example our services address a broad range of employment process needs such as payroll payrollrelated tax filing human resource information employee selfservice capabilities time and labor management and recruitment and applicant screening a customer arrangement may contain any of these elements with different elements delivered across multiple reporting periods 

we have a single unit of accounting for each deliverable in a contract based on the use of estimated selling price “esp” in those cases where vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” or third party evidence “tpe” cannot be established our determination of esp involves the consideration of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of each contract specifically we consider the cost to produce or to provide the deliverable the anticipated margin on that deliverable the selling price and profit margin for similar services the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable will be sold 

when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe we use esp in the allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a standalone basis 

we regularly review vsoe tpe and esp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates there were no material impacts during the period nor do we currently expect a material impact in the near term from changes in vsoe tpe or esp 

 

deferred reve nue consists primarily of customer billings in advance of revenues being recognized from our contracts deferred revenue also includes certain deferred professional services fees that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with subscription fees and are recognized as revenues over the same period as the related customer contract deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized during the succeeding twelvemonth period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is reco rded as noncurrent

nongaap measures

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin

we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin nongaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance adjusted ebitda is a component of our management incentive plan and adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations sponsor management fees noncash charges for asset impairments gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary sharebased compensation expense severance charges restructuring consulting fees transaction costs and environmental reserve charges adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the control of operating management 

our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit loss net income loss earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by similar items to those eliminated in this presentation adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are included in this discussion because they are key metrics used by management to assess our operating performance 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not defined under gaap are not measures of net income operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap and are subject to important limitations our use of the terms adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 













 

in evaluating adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to tho se eliminated in this presentation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and pension obligations we seek to minimize or manage these market risks through normal operating and financing activities we do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the market fluctuations nor do we use instruments where there are not underlying exposures 

foreign currency risk  our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar due to the relative size of our international operations to date we have not instituted an active hedging program we expect our international operations to continue to grow in the near term and we are monitoring the foreign currency exposure to determine if we should begin a hedging program 

interest rate risk  in connection with our us and canadian payroll and tax filing services we collect funds for payment of payroll and taxes temporarily hold such funds in trust until payment is due remit the funds to the customers’ employees and appropriate taxing authority file federal state and local tax returns and handle related regulatory correspondence and amendments we invest the us customer trust funds primarily in high quality bank deposits money market mutual funds or collateralized shortterm investments we may also invest these funds in us treasury and agency securities as well as highly rated assetbacked mortgagebacked municipal and corporate securities our canadian customer trust funds are invested in securities issued by the government and provinces of canada highly rated canadian banks and corporations assetbacked trusts and mortgages 

we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates however because we classify our securities as “available for sale” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary 

we do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

pension obligation risk  we provide a pension plan for a number of former employees in applying relevant accounting policies we have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets discount rates and health care cost trends the cost of pension benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets assumptions for future periods contributions and benefit experience in 2018 we contributed 185 million to our pension plan 

the effective discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations in 2018 ranged from 370 to 392 the expected rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2018 was 630 the following table reflects the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level however our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected
