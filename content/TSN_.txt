raw materials and sources of supply 

beef 

the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions to buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities although we generally expect adequate supply of live cattle in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

pork 

the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ hog buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the supply of live hogs is adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a small number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of market hogs and live swine for our own processing needs although we generally expect adequate supply of live hogs in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

chicken 

the primary raw materials used in our domestic chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract farmers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are raised to 20 weeks of age sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract farmers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing facilities where they are harvested and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2022 corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 62 of our cost of growing a live chicken domestically in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future 

while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

prepared foods 

the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commoditybased raw materials including beef pork chicken turkey flour vegetables cheese eggs seasonings and other cooking ingredients some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for beef chicken and certain prepared foods products such as hot dogs and smoked sausage generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and certain other prepared foods products such as prepared meals meat dishes appetizers and breakfast sausage generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart inc accounted for 177  of our fiscal 2022 consolidated sales sales to walmart inc were included in all of our segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2022 consolidated sales

environmental regulation and food safety 

environmental regulation 

our facilities for processing beef pork chicken turkey and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment 

we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

food safety 

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our beef pork chicken and prepared foods products are subject to inspection primarily by the usda and the united states food and drug administration “fda” we also participate in the usda’s hazard analysis and critical control points “haccp” program or fda’s hazard analysis and riskbased prevention controls “harpc” program as applicable and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 additionally our foreign operations are subject to various other food safety and quality assurance oversight and review 

greenhouse gas emissions 

congress the united states environmental protection agency some states and nonus governments continue to consider various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time what options if any will be finalized and whether such options would have a direct impact on the company although we have not incurred significant costs or capital expenditures due to continuing uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

tyson closely monitors developments in this area and voluntarily sets goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the science based targets initiative sbti criteria including our ambition to reach netzero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 we continue to evaluate the plans and associated costs of achieving our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals

 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

business  operational risk factors 

the covid19 pandemic and associated responses has had and may to continue to have an adverse impact on our business and operations 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected many parts of our business and operations the extent that the covid19 pandemic continues to impact general economic conditions and our business operations and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict including but not limited to the duration and spread of the pandemic and additional variants its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact including the distribution and efficacy of vaccines against new variants and the speed of critical mass adoption of available vaccines and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

during the pandemic we experienced slowdowns at certain of our production facilities primarily due to a decrease in our available workforce and we anticipate that we may in the future experience additional volatility in our ability to operate our facilities at full utilization rates depending on a number of factors including team member absenteeism labor shortages and other workforce disruptions any additional extended period of operating at a reduced capacity or more significant reductions in our operations at our facilities could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate our business and on our results of operations 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience an increase in operating costs in connection with higher costs associated with ensuring the continued health and safety of team members including team member costs associated with worker health and availability such as covid19 testing and vaccinations there can be no assurance that the health and safety measures we have taken with respect to covid19 will eradicate the risks associated with working in a critical infrastructure industry including but not limited to infection of our employees or a temporary reduction in the operating capacity of a facility further there can be no assurance that we will not incur additional direct incremental expenses related to covid19 going forward and that such amounts will not be material or have a material impact on our business cash flows or results of operations 

our team members who have tested positive for covid19 and in some cases those working in close contact with diagnosed persons are required to be quarantined which has led to a decrease in our available workforce in various locations in late fiscal 2021 we implemented a requirement for our team members in the us to be fully vaccinated against covid19 by november 1 2021 we lifted this requirement effective october 31 2022 although while it was in effect this requirement generally improved our ability to operate our business effectively in fiscal 2022 the decrease in our available workforce during the covid19 pandemic has at times adversely impacted this ability if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work including because of illness this could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations in addition certain of our team members who claim to have tested positive for covid19 or their family members have filed lawsuits seeking compensatory and punitive damages for wrongful death and personal injury claims in several states and additional team members or family members of team members may assert similar claims as the covid19 pandemic continues if we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims we may experience significant losses and expenses in connection with these lawsuits which could adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

we have also experienced and expect to continue to experience disruption and volatility in our supply chain which has resulted and may continue to result in increased costs for certain raw materials packaging materials and transportation costs the spread of covid19 and other related supply chain issues have also disrupted and may continue to disrupt logistics necessary to import export and deliver products to us and our customers many ports and other channels of entry are operating at only a portion of capacity as a result of congestion due to labor and equipment shortages and means of transporting products within regions or countries may be limited for the same reason other supply chain risks associated with the covid19 pandemic include but are not limited to shutdowns or reduced operations at our suppliers’ facilities the continued inability of some of our contract producers to manage their livestock supply chain disruptions for feed grains changes in consumer orders due to shifting consumer patterns changes in livestock and protein market prices and additional disruptions in logistics or the distribution chain for our products the occurrence of any of which may result in a reduction in our fill rates to our customers in addition our operations or those of independent contract poultry producers and producers who provide the live animals to our production operations may become more limited in their ability to procure deliver or produce our food products because of labor shortages 

as a result of school and inrestaurant dining shutdowns during the covid19 pandemic each of our segments previously experienced a shift in demand from foodservice to retail while each of our segments has subsequently experienced varying levels of foodservice recovery the longterm impact of covid19 remains uncertain and will depend on a number of future developments which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time in addition in the event of a protracted period of economic downturn demand for our foodservice products may remain below expectations or decrease further and demand for our retail consumption products may also decrease which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

we also face other risks associated with the covid19 pandemic including 

• additional increase in input cost may not be adequately captured through pricing 

• adverse changes to the global economy may subject us to risk of material intangible and longlived asset impairments adjustments for inventory and market volatility for items subject to fair value measurements such as derivatives and investments 

• an increase in working capital needs andor an increase in trade accounts receivable writeoffs and associated reserves as a result of increased financial pressures on our suppliers or customers who are not able to pay in a timely manner or at all 

• a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn which could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products and 

• litigation 

the severity and duration of the current covid19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response are unknown and are impossible to predict with certainty any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of our financial excellence programs which may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 the company approved a restructuring program the “2022 program” which is expected to improve business performance increase collaboration enhance team member agility enable faster decisionmaking and reduce redundancies in conjunction with the 2022 program the company plans to bring together all its corporate team members from the chicago downers grove and dakota dunes area corporate locations to its world headquarters in springdale arkansas through a phased relocation commencing in early calendar year 2023 we anticipate the 2022 program and associated expenses will be substantially complete in our fiscal 2025 for more information regarding this program refer to part ii item 8 notes to the consolidated financial statements note 7 restructuring and related charges additionally in fiscal 2022 we launched a new productivity program which is designed to drive a better faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decisionmaking 

the success of the financial excellence programs or future financial excellence programs including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully implement the programs in an efficient and effective manner the implementation of the financial excellence programs may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the financial excellence programs may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits if we are unable to implement the financial excellence programs smoothly or successfully or we otherwise do not capture the anticipated savings our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted 

in addition we may incur higher costs than anticipated and the program impacts could result in performance shortfalls the financial excellence programs may become a distraction for our organization and may disrupt our ongoing business operations cause deterioration in team member morale disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations and result in negative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation if we are unable to successfully manage the negative consequences of the financial excellence programs our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be adversely affected 

we are subject to risks associated with our international activities which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign locations as well as our operations and assets in such locations 

in fiscal 2022 we sold products to customers in approximately 140 countries major sales markets include australia canada central america chile china the european union the united kingdom japan mexico malaysia the middle east singapore south korea taiwan and thailand our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2022 totaled 83 billion of which 58 billion related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 15 billion of longlived assets located in foreign locations primarily brazil china the european union new zealand and thailand at the end of fiscal 2022 

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

• closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of beef pork and poultry products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues 

• impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and foreign currencies particularly the australian dollar the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro the malaysian ringgit the mexican peso and the thai baht 

• political and economic conditions including the ongoing conflicts between ukraine and russia 

• difficulties and costs to comply with and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws treaties and regulations including without limitation the united states foreign corrupt practices act and economic and trade sanctions enforced by the united states department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control 

• different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments 

• tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

• distribution costs disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation and 

• the ongoing impact of covid19 including any resurgence and new or existing variants on the global economy and on consumer demand worldwide imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by foreign countries regarding the importation of beef pork poultry and prepared foods products in addition to import or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries 

negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information technology systems against or effectively respond to cyber attacks other cyber incidents or security breaches or if our information technology systems are otherwise disrupted 

information technology is an important part of our business operations and we rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements in addition we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities personnel customers and suppliers like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof user errors natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses cyber attacks hackers unauthorized access attempts and other security issues in addition such incidents could result in unauthorized or accidental disclosure of material confidential information or regulated individual personal data 

we have in the past experienced and may in the future face cyber attacks other cyber incidents or security breaches and there can be no assurance that we will always be able to sufficiently mitigate the impacts to our business and operations we have implemented and continue to evaluate security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks but these measures may not be adequate attempted cyber attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise 

any significant failure of our systems including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended or our failure to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents could cause transaction errors processing inefficiencies loss of customers and sales have negative consequences on our team members and our business partners have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation and expose us to liability litigation and regulatory enforcement actions in addition we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our business partners customers consumers or suppliers finally the disclosure of nonpublic information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image similar risks exist with respect to the thirdparty vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions including health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions and systems managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors we have not experienced any significant cyberrelated events in the current fiscal year 

we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable strategic acquisitions or divestitures or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties including 

• challenges in realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction 

• difficulty integrating acquired businesses technologies operations and personnel with our existing business 

• diversion of management attention in connection with negotiating transactions and integrating the businesses acquired 

• difficulty identifying suitable candidates 

• consummating a transaction on terms that are favorable to us 

• challenges in retaining the acquired businesses’ customers and key team members 

• inability to implement and maintain consistent standards controls procedures and information systems 

• exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies and 

• the availability and terms of additional debt or equity financing for any transaction 

we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results additionally from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

industry risk factors 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition as well as the selling prices for our products are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as beef pork poultry corn soybean meal packaging materials and energy and to a lesser extent cheese fruit seasoning blends flour corn syrup corn oils butter and sugar corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients for instance represented roughly 62 of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2022 

production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control such factors include among other things weather patterns throughout the world outbreaks of disease the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability the company’s objective continues to be to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time however we may not always be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors in addition if we increase prices to offset higher costs we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes conversely decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices while we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices 

over time if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program then commodity and raw material price increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability financial condition and results of operations 

the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

the food industry in general is intensely competitive we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach some of the factors on which we compete include pricing product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of our products including distribution channels used such as ecommerce and competing products customer service and credit terms 

from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and promotions and new product innovation such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases could harm our profit margins if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer alternatively if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes our revenues and market share could be adversely affected 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and the supply and demand for our products 

supply of and demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases including african swine fever “asf” bovine spongiform encephalopathy foot and mouth disease and highly pathogenic avian influenza “hpai” which can have a significant impact on our financial results in recent years asf has impacted hog herds in china asia europe and the caribbean and if an outbreak of asf were to occur in the united states the company’s supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted hpai was detected within the united states in 2022 and additional new cases have been recently confirmed in certain states efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary biosecurity measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or livestock owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers 

failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results 

our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences purchasing behaviors and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want in the channels where they shop we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify develop manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets such as adapting to emerging ecommerce channels our financial results and our competitive position will suffer in addition our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights which could negatively impact our results of operations 

we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments including advertising consumer promotions and trade spend due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising promotions and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices 

our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image 

we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image if we do not maintain or extend our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart inc which accounted for 177 of our sales in fiscal 2022 our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts and if they do sign contracts they generally are limited in scope and duration there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past alternative retail channels such as convenience stores dollar stores drug stores club stores and internetbased retailers have increased their market share 

this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be adversely impacted many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products additionally these large customers may demand more favorable terms that may expose us to greater risks including uncapped indemnification and no limitation of liability provisions such terms may obligate us to pay significant amounts in connection with potential losses arising from claims and related legal proceedings and any such claims could also affect our reputation and our relationship with customers we generally attempt to limit the maximum amount of indemnification or liability that we could be exposed to under our contracts but this is not always possible without risking the loss of a customer relationship particularly with our more significant customers the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to or adverse change to trade terms with a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products especially during economic downturn may adversely affect our profitability 

in many product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows or if there is a perception of such a narrowing consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us in addition in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more lowerpriced private label or other economy brands to the extent this occurs we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition in times of economic uncertainty consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers which in turn reduces our product sales 

labor  employment risk factors 

labor shortages and increased turnover or increases in employee and employeerelated costs could have adverse effects on our profitability 

we have experienced increased labor shortages at some of our production facilities and other locations while we have historically experienced some level of ordinary course turnover of employees the impact of the covid19 pandemic and resulting actions have exacerbated labor shortages and increased turnover a number of factors have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the labor force available to us including government regulations which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety wage and hour practices and immigration labor shortages and increased turnover rates within our team members have led to and could in the future lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our production facilities or otherwise operate at full capacity an overall or prolonged labor shortage lack of skilled labor increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on our operations results of operations liquidity or cash flows 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our team members and their labor unions 

we have approximately 142000 team members approximately 42000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with team members and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our team members or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

if we are unable to attract hire or retain key team members or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce it could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our continued growth requires us to attract hire retain and develop key team members including our executive officers and senior management team and maintain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to attract and hire highly skilled team members and our own team members are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies competition could cause us to lose talented team members and unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for team members in addition our compensation arrangements may not always be successful in attracting new employees or retaining our existing team members in fiscal 2022 we approved a plan to bring together all of our corporate team members from our chicago downers grove and dakota dunes area corporate locations to our world headquarters in springdale arkansas while this move is intended to foster closer collaboration enhance team member agility and enable faster decisionmaking thereby improving our ability to execute our business strategy there can be no assurance that affected team members will agree to relocate on existing compensation arrangements or at all or that we will not lose skilled members of our workforce including certain senior management or other key employees as a result of this consolidation 

we depend on contract farmers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract farmers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with farmers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected certain of our competitors may also negotiate more favorable contract terms that could provide them with competitive advantages and affect our supply 

legal  regulatory risk factors 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could adversely affect our financial results and damage our reputation 

our products may be subject to contamination by foreign materials or diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the furtherprocessing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction some of our commercial contracts with our customers have uncapped indemnification clauses or no limitation of liability provisions so any of these occurrences could cause us to pay significant amounts in penalties and spend significant resources which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results while we also benefit from certain indemnification obligations from our customers such protections may not adequately cover all claims brought against us or cover only a portion of such claim in addition we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil become contaminated are tampered with or are mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products see “environmental regulation and food safety” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us including the united kingdom’s exit from the european union could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected for example increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices 

increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change as well as alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives including those related to single use plastics may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us we use natural gas diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability 

climate change and any legal or regulatory responses may have a longterm adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

climate change and rising global temperatures may contribute to changing weather patterns heavier or more frequent storms and wildfires and increased frequency and severity of natural disasters decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world caused by changing weather patterns has limited and may continue to limit the availability or may increase the cost of key agricultural commodities and natural resource ingredients and manufacturing inputs as well as raw materials such as beef pork poultry corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients this in turn could lead to increased food insecurity in communities around the world increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures 

increasing concern over climate change also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer preferences and result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to manage greenhouse gas emissions climate risks and resulting environmental impacts increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements could be prohibitively costly and may cause disruptions in or an increase in the costs associated with the running of our production facilities furthermore compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations and strategy which will likely incur substantial time attention and costs even if we make changes to align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements we may still be subject to significant fines if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices the effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a longterm adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

finally we currently provide certain climaterelated disclosures and from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint these disclosures and goals and our progress towards these commitments may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and assumptions that are subject to change in the future there can be no assurance that our current disclosures and targets and the methodologies that we currently use to support our disclosures and progress towards our targets will satisfy any new regulations and legal requirements in the us and abroad and the costs of aligning our current disclosures and goals to any new legal requirements may be significant additionally if we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon emissions reduction goals and commitments the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our products 

the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation proceedings and investigations 

our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment compliance with these laws and regulations and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations is material to our business new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation assessment or expenditures in addition some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and over time we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities andor waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses the occurrence of any of these events the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial results 

legal claims class action lawsuits other regulatory enforcement actions or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our team members contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those contained in item 3 legal proceedings and part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies in this annual report on form 10k could subject us to civil and criminal penalties including debarment from governmental contracts that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results 

financial risk factors 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

• it may limit or impair our ability to obtain financing in the future 

• our credit ratings or any decrease to our credit ratings could restrict or impede our ability to access capital markets at desired interest rates and increase our borrowing costs 

• it may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise 

• a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes and 

• it may restrict our ability to pay dividends 

our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about sales growth operating margins royalty rates valuation multiples and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using income and market approaches the income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction the market approach measures value based on what other purchasers in the market have paid for assets or business interests that can be considered reasonably similar to each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate sales growth operating margins royalty rates and discount rates amongst other assumptions disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions including as a result of inflation could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business increased discount rates or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of october 1 2022 we had 146 billion of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which represented approximately 396 of total assets 

participation in a multiemployer pension plan could adversely affect our business 

we participate in a “multiemployer” pension plan that provides defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements this type of plan is typically administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives we are required to make periodic contributions to this plan to allow the plan to meet its pension benefit obligation to its participants our required contributions to this fund could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to this fund inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan then applicable law could require us to make additional lumpsum contributions to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits the plan in which we participate is reported to have a significant underfunded liability such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal were to occur with respect to the multiemployer plan the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 

volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for team members in the united states the difference between plan obligations and assets which signifies the funded status of the plans is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements as of october 1 2022 the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of 159 million as compared to an underfunded position of 215 million at the end of fiscal 2021 changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that are not hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

general risk factors 

deterioration of economic conditions including recession financial instability or inflation could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

• make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future 

• cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any amendment of or waivers under our credit agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future 

• impair the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers thereby increasing customer bad debts or nonperformance by suppliers 

• negatively impact global demand for protein products which could result in a reduction of sales operating income and cash flows 

• decrease the value of our investments in equity and debt securities including our marketable debt securities companyowned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets 

• negatively impact our commodity purchasing activities if we are required to record losses related to derivative financial instruments or 

• impair the financial viability of our insurers 

in addition consumer spending may decline at any time for reasons beyond our control and the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may reduce consumer confidence and result in a decrease in consumer demand for our products furthermore inflation which has significantly risen has and may continue to increase our operational costs including labor costs and grain and feed ingredient costs and continued increases in interest rates in response to concerns about inflation may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks as a result instability and weakness of the us and global economies including due to the effects caused by disruptions to financial markets inflation recession high unemployment geopolitical events and other effects caused by the covid19 pandemic and the negative effects on consumers’ spending may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations a prolonged period of reduced consumer spending could have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages decrease in availability of water damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels or unfavorably impact the demand for or our consumers’ ability to purchase our products among other things any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our trade secrets patents and copyrights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions 

we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties which could adversely affect our financial results in december 2021 we received an assessment from the mexican tax authorities related to the 2015 sale of our direct and indirect equity interests in subsidiaries which held our mexico operations at october 1 2022 the assessment totaled approximately 411 million 83 billion mexican pesos which includes tax inflation adjustment interest and penalties we believe the assertions made in the assessment letter have no merit and will defend our positions through the mexican administrative appeal process and litigation if necessary based on our analysis of this assessment in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” guidance related to unrecognized tax benefits we have not recorded a liability related to the issue

overview 

fiscal year 

the company’s accounting cycle resulted in a 52week year for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 and a 53week year for fiscal 2020 

general 

sales grew 13 in fiscal 2022 over fiscal 2021 to 533 billion largely due to increased sales growth across each of our segments primarily due to higher average sales prices combined with 545 million in legal contingency accruals recognized as a reduction to sales in fiscal 2021 the higher average sales prices were primarily due to the current inflationary environment and recovery of rapidly rising costs such as labor freight and transportation livestock feed ingredients and other input costs operating income of 4410 million in fiscal 2022 was up slightly compared to fiscal 2021 as improved chicken results were offset by a decline in operating income in the beef pork and prepared foods segments in fiscal 2022 our operating income was impacted by 66 million of restructuring and related charges and 62 million of insurance proceeds net of costs incurred related to fires at our production facilities in fiscal 2021 our operating income was impacted by 626 million of charges related to legal contingency accruals 27 million of charges related to the relocation of a production facility in china 23 million of production facilities fire costs net of insurance proceeds and a 784 million gain on the sale of our pet treats business 

market environment 

according to the usda domestic protein production beef pork chicken and turkey was relatively flat in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 all segments experienced inflation in operating costs especially in labor freight and transportation and certain materials and we expect these trends to continue through fiscal 2023 additionally grain and feed ingredient costs have increased substantially which impacts all of our segments we pursue recovery of these increased costs through pricing the federal reserve recently increased interest rates and it is anticipated that interest rates will continue to rise in the near term our direct exposure to rising interest rates is somewhat tempered given our strong liquidity position in addition to our current debt structure in which nearly all of our borrowings have fixed interest rates at october 1 2022 we had 33 billion of liquidity and our current debt was 459 million should we need to issue additional debt or borrow under our existing revolving credit facility we may be exposed to higher interest rates than our current outstanding borrowings the beef segment experienced strong demand sufficient supply of marketready cattle and increased live cattle costs the pork segment experienced reduced domestic availability of live hogs the chicken segment experienced strong demand and increased feed ingredient and other input costs the prepared foods segment experienced increased costs largely due to the impacts of an inflationary environment additionally the conflict between ukraine and russia has led to economic sanctions against russia and certain regions of ukraine and belarus as of october 1 2022 the impact of this conflict has not had a material direct impact on our consolidated financial performance however the conflict is still ongoing and there are many risks and uncertainties in relation to the conflict that are outside of our control if the conflict escalates further or if additional countries join the conflict and additional economic sanctions are imposed it could have a material impact on our business operations and financial performance 

covid19 

we continue to proactively monitor and respond to the evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic and its impact to our global business our ongoing covid19 task force was formed for the primary purposes of maintaining the health and safety of our team members ensuring our ability to operate our processing facilities and maintaining the liquidity of our business we have experienced and continue to experience multiple challenges related to the pandemic the most significant challenge we face is the availability of team members to operate our production facilities as our production facilities continue to experience varying levels of absenteeism the health and safety of our team members remains our top priority and we continue to provide a variety of health and safety resources and services to team members and their family members additionally we have experienced some challenges in our supply chain such as volatility of inputs availability of shipping containers and port congestion these challenges impacted our operating costs but generally we experienced lower direct incremental costs associated with covid19 in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 the longterm impacts of covid19 remain uncertain and will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic covid19 variants and resurgences and related actions taken by federal state and local government officials to prevent and manage disease spread and effectively distribute and administer vaccinations all of which contain some level of uncertainty and cannot be easily predicted 

margins 

our total operating margin was 83 in fiscal 2022 operating margins by segment were as follows 

• beef – 126 

• pork – 30

capital resources 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed capacity of 225 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs and to backstop our commercial paper program 

at october 1 2022 amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility totaled 225 billion our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 20 banks with commitments ranging from 35 million to 175 million per bank 

commercial paper program 

our commercial paper program provides a lowcost source of borrowing to fund general corporate purposes including working capital requirements the maximum borrowing capacity under the commercial paper program is 15 billion the maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance as of october 1 2022 we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program our ability to access commercial paper in the future may be limited or its costs increased 

capitalization 

to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our longterm financing decisions at october 1 2022 and october 2 2021 the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 13x and 12x respectively refer to other key financial measures below for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable generally accepted accounting principles “gaap ”  measures 

credit ratings 

revolving credit facility 

sps applicable rating is “bbb” moodys applicable rating is “baa2” the below table outlines the fees paid on the unused portion of the facility “facility fee rate” and letter of credit fees and borrowings “allin borrowing spread” that corresponds to the applicable ratings levels from sp and moodys 



in the event the ratings fall within different levels the applicable rate will be based upon the higher of the two levels or if there is more than a onenotch split between the two levels then the applicable rate will be based upon the level that is one level below the higher level 

debt covenants 

our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october 1 2022 and expect that we will maintain compliance 

pension plans 

as further described in part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pensions and other postretirement benefits the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of 159 million at the end of fiscal 2022 as compared to an underfunded position of 215 million at the end of fiscal 2021 we contributed 13 million in fiscal 2022 and expect to contribute approximately 13 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2023 the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements as a result the actual funding in fiscal 2023 may be different from the estimate 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties including leases debt and livestock grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 1 2022 in millions 

1 in the event of a default on payment acceleration of the principal payments could occur 

2 interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective interest rates at october 1 2022 and expected payment dates 

3 amounts include guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties which consist of leases debt and livestock grower loans all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment the amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments 

4 for additional information regarding operating leases refer to part ii item 8 notes to the consolidated financial statements note 6 leases 

5 amounts include agreements with a remaining term in excess of one year to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the purchase obligations amount included items such as future purchase commitments for grains and livestock purchase contracts that provide terms that meet the above criteria for certain grain purchase commitments with a fixed quantity provision we have assumed the future obligations under the commitment based on available commodity futures prices as published in observable active markets as of october 1 2022 we have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria purchase orders are not included in the table as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is cancellable contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded 

6 amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of october 1 2022 

7 other longterm liabilities primarily consist of deferred compensation deferred income selfinsurance and asset retirement obligations we are unable to reliably estimate the amount and timing of the remaining payments beyond fiscal 2022 therefore we have only included the total liability in the table above we also have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits of 205 million that are excluded from the table above a discussion of the companys pension and postretirement plans including funding matters is included in part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pensions and other postretirement benefits 

in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 130 million and related interest and penalties of 47 million at october 1 2022 recorded in other longterm liabilities 

the potential maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at october 1 2022 based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 290 million after analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions we had no allowance for these programs estimated credit losses at october 1 2022 

other key financial measures 

the following are other key financial measures used by the company for the purposes of assessing performance and highlighting operational trends as well as our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service out debt 



a excludes the amortization of debt issuance and debt discount expense of 11 million 19 million 14 million for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively as it is included in interest expense 

b return on invested capital is calculated by dividing aftertax operating income calculated by applying the company’s effective tax rate to operating income by the average of beginning and ending total debt and shareholders’ equity less cash and cash equivalents 

c for the total debt to capitalization calculation capitalization is defined as total debt plus total shareholders’ equity 

d book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders’ equity by the sum of class a and b shares outstanding 

ebitda is defined as net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization net debt to ebitda represents the ratio of our debt net of cash and shortterm investments to ebitda ebitda and net debt to ebitda are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business we believe the presentation of these financial measures helps investors to assess our operating performance from period to period including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends these measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies however the measurements of ebitda and net debt to ebitda may not be comparable to those of other companies which limits their usefulness as comparative measures ebitda and net debt to ebitda are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity ebitda is a useful tool for assessing but is not a reliable indicator of our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine ebitda involve outlays of cash as a result actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from ebitda investors should rely primarily on our gaap results and use nongaap financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions 

recently issuedadopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to the discussion under part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of significant accounting policies and note 2 changes in accounting principles 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical these estimates require levels of subjectivity and judgment which could result in actual results differing from our estimates 

contingent liabilities 

description 

we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to wage and hourlabor antitrust environmental product taxing authorities and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required if any for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated we disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable 

judgments and uncertainties 

our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years as set forth in part ii item 8 notes to the consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies we recognized 626 million of charges in fiscal 2021 from legal accruals related to our broiler antitrust civil litigation broiler chicken grower litigation and wage rate litigation based on our assessment of the likelihood and amount of probable losses we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 

revenue recognition 

description 

we recognize revenue for the sale of our product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale revenue is measured by the transaction price which is defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing goods to customers the transaction price is adjusted for estimates of known or expected variable consideration which includes consumer incentives trade promotions and allowances such as coupons discounts rebates volumebased incentives cooperative advertising and other programs variable consideration related to these programs is recorded as a reduction to revenue based on amounts we expect to pay 

judgments and uncertainties 

the transaction price contains estimates of known or expected variable consideration we base these estimates on current performance historical utilization and projected redemption rates of each program we review and update these estimates regularly until the incentives or product returns are realized and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue as noted above estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors typically programs that are offered have a short duration and historically the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements however if the level of redemption rates or performance were to vary significantly from estimates we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue during the past three fiscal years 

accrued selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to health and welfare workers’ compensation auto liability and general liability claims we use an independent thirdparty actuary to assist in determining our selfinsurance liability we and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our selfinsurance liability including claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions we periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our thirdparty actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our selfinsurance liability our policy is to maintain an accrual at the actuarial estimated median 

judgments and uncertainties 

our selfinsurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used costs to settle our obligations including legal and healthcare costs could increase or decrease causing estimates of our selfinsurance liability to change incident rates including frequency and severity could increase or decrease causing estimates in our selfinsurance liability to change 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our selfinsurance liability however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material a 10 change in the actuarial estimate at october 1 2022 would not have a significant impact on our liability 

income taxes 

description 

we estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income income tax includes an estimate for withholding taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the united states but does not include an estimate for taxes on earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset we record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 

judgments and uncertainties 

changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

due to the complexity of some of these judgments and uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities to the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future other than those potential impacts we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances 

defined benefit pension plans 

description 

we sponsor four defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain team members we also participate in a multiemployer plan that provides defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives we use independent thirdparty actuaries to assist us in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost we and the actuaries review assumptions that include estimates of the present value of the projected future pension payment to all plan participants taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience we accumulate and amortize the effect of actuarial gains and losses over future periods net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit pension plans was 10 million in fiscal 2022 the projected benefit obligation was 183 million at the end of fiscal 2022 unrecognized actuarial gain was 13 million at the end of fiscal 2022 we currently expect net periodic benefit cost associated with our pension plans to be approximately 6 million in fiscal 2023 we expect to contribute approximately 13 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2023 the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements 

judgments and uncertainties 

our defined benefit pension plans contain uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used the key assumptions used in developing the required estimates include such factors as discount rates expected returns on plan assets retirement rates and mortality these assumptions can have a material impact upon the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost the expected liquidation of certain plans has been considered along with these assumptions the discount rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve developed from highquality debt securities were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate in determining the longterm rate of return on plan assets we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans we then determined a longterm projected rateofreturn based on expected returns investment management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality it is reasonably likely that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods 

the risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from singleemployer plans the net pension cost of the multiemployer plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our team members the future cost of these plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions they are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the net periodic benefit cost in future periods a 1 change in the discount rate at october 1 2022 would not have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation or net periodic benefit cost a 1 change in the return on plan assets at october 1 2022 would not have a significant impact on net periodic benefit cost the sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time with the remaining assumptions held constant economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effect of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear 

impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

description 

goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary if it is determined based on qualitative factors the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macroeconomic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount additionally we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 

for indefinite life intangible assets a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired similar to goodwill we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets outside of the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization or significant changes in macroeconomic factors such as increased interest and discount rates 

judgments and uncertainties 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques with the primary technique being an income approach discounted cash flow method and another technique being a market approach guideline public company method which use significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy we include assumptions about sales growth operating margins discount rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets business plans economic projections and marketplace data and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize operating margin assumptions based on future expectations operating margins historically realized in the reporting units’ industries and industry marketplace valuation multiples all of our material reporting units estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 at the date of the most recent estimated fair value determination other than one chicken segment reporting unit and two international reporting units 

one of our chicken segment reporting units had goodwill at october 1 2022 of 06 billion the reporting units projected operating margins included in the annual impairment test in fiscal 2022 averaged approximately 5 which was consistent with the reporting units fiscal 2022 performance additionally a hypothetical increase in the discount rate of approximately 100 basis points at the date of the 2022 test with all other assumptions unchanged would have caused the carrying value of this reporting unit to approximate its fair value 

our international reporting units which are presented in internationalother for segment presentation had goodwill at october 1 2022 of 04 billion which originated from acquisitions in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 we generally assumed operating margins in future years would increase as we continue to integrate recent acquisitions and implement our international growth strategy as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year two reporting units with goodwill totaling 02 billion at october 1 2022 would have failed the quantitative step of the annual impairment test which may have resulted in a goodwill impairment loss we are still integrating the recent acquisitions and investing in our international and global business strategy in addition to managing through the temporary impacts of covid19 the reporting units projected longterm operating margins included in the annual impairment test in fiscal 2022 had to exceed an average of 4 to achieve breakeven results in the analysis a hypothetical increase in the discount rates of approximately 50 basis points with all other assumptions unchanged at the date of the test would have caused the carrying values of the international reporting units to approximate their fair values 

the fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using multiperiod excess earnings and relieffromroyalty valuation approaches which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales growth operating margins royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events and assumptions many of which are outside the control of management which could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 all of our material reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets passed the impairment analysis 

our impairment analysis contains inherent estimates and assumptions many of which are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates market ebitda comparables and credit ratings which could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions the assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value require considerable judgement and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions these assumptions can change in future periods as a result of overall economic conditions including the impacts of inflationary pressures increased interest and discount rates and global supply chain constraints amongst others as a result there can be no assurance that estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of assessing impairments will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future potential circumstances that could have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units include but are not limited to lower than forecasted growth rates or operating margins and changes in discount rates a reduction in the estimated fair value of the reporting units could trigger an impairment in the future we cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived assets 

all of our material reporting units’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination other than one chicken segment reporting unit and two international reporting units consequently we do not currently consider any of our other material reporting units at significant risk of impairment 

our fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analyses did not result in an impairment charge all indefinite life intangible assets’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material indefinite life intangible assets at significant risk of impairment 

we evaluated the changing macroeconomic conditions that occurred in the fourth quarter subsequent to the date of our annual impairment assessment including inflationary pressures rising interest rates demand outlook and export markets as well as the company’s decreased market capitalization based on this evaluation we did not identify additional risk of our goodwill reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets in which estimated fair value did not exceed their carrying value by more than 20 as of october 1 2022 other than the one chicken segment reporting unit and two international reporting units previously described 

impairment of longlived assets and definite life intangibles 

description 

longlived assets and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset a change in its physical condition or an unexpected change in financial performance 

when evaluating longlived assets and definite life intangibles for impairment we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset group for assets held for sale we compare the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 

we recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets of 34 million 60 million and 48 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

judgments and uncertainties 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions including useful lives and intended use of assets observable market valuations forecasted sales growth operating margins royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of longlived assets or definite life intangibles during the last three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments or useful lives of longlived assets or definite life intangibles however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material we periodically conduct projects to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity manufacturing efficiencies and business technology if we have a significant change in strategies outlook or a manner in which we plan to use these assets we may be exposed to future impairments 

business combinations 

description 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

we use various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as net realizable value to value inventory cost method and market approach to value property relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings to value intangibles and discounted cash flow to value goodwill 

for significant acquisitions we may use independent thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

judgments and uncertainties 

significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed particularly intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including sales growth operating margins attrition rates and discount rates based on historical results business plans expected synergies perceived risk and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions which could result in subsequent impairments we had no material business combinations during fiscal 2022 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately 

further we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk 

we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock during normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily forwards and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting we generally do not hedge anticipated transactions beyond 18 months the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of october 1 2022 and october 2 2021 on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted forward and option prices the market risk exposure analysis included both derivatives designated as hedge instruments and derivatives not designated as hedge instruments 



interest rate risk 

at october 1 2022 we had variable rate debt of 2 million with a weighted average interest rate of 30 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at october 1 2022 and october 2 2021 would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at october 1 2022 we had fixedrate debt of 8319 million with a weighted average interest rate of 45 market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would have changed the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 215 million at october 1 2022 and 154 million at october 2 2021 the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our pension and postretirement benefit obligations changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pensions and other postretirement benefits for additional information 

foreign currency risk 

we have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currencies we have exposure to are the australian dollar the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro the malaysian ringgit the mexican peso and the thai baht we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have had a 25 million and 13 million impact on pretax income at october 1 2022 and october 2 2021 respectively 

concentrations of credit risk 

our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at october 1 2022 and october 2 2021 164 and 163 respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart inc no other single customer or customer group represented 10 or greater of net accounts receivable

overview 

covid19 

we continue to monitor and respond to the evolving nature of covid19 and its impact to our global business we formed an internal covid19 task force for the primary purposes of maintaining the health and safety of our team members ensuring our ability to operate our processing facilities and maintaining the liquidity of our business we have experienced and continue to experience multiple challenges related to the pandemic these challenges increased our operating costs and negatively impacted our sales volumes for the back half of fiscal 2020 and are anticipated to continue into fiscal 2021 operationally we experienced slowdowns and temporary idling of production facilities due to team member absenteeism and choices we made to ensure team member health and safety as a result we have experienced lower levels of productivity and higher costs of production this will likely continue in the short term until the effects of covid19 diminish each of our segments has also experienced a shift in demand from foodservice to retail during 2020 however the volume increases in retail have not been sufficient to offset the decreases in foodservice these current trends including the combination of operational challenges and volume impacts will likely continue into fiscal 2021 and have a negative impact on overall earnings the ultimate impact of covid19 remains uncertain and will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by federal state and local government officials to prevent and manage disease spread all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted 

• team members – the health and safety of our team members is our top priority to protect our team members we have implemented and will continue to implement safety measures recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and the occupational safety and health administration “osha” in our facilities and coordinate with other health officials as appropriate including but not limited to checking the temperature of team members as they enter company facilities restricting visitor access increasing efforts to deep clean and sanitize facilities requiring the use of protective face coverings and making protective face coverings and other protective equipment available to team members and encouraging team members who feel sick to stay at home through relaxed attendance policies and enhanced benefits we implemented additional ways to promote social distancing in our production facilities by creating additional breakroom space and allowing extra time between shifts to reduce interaction of team members as well as erecting dividers between workstations or increasing the space between workers on the production floor for officebased team members we have encouraged team members capable of working from home to do so and are prioritizing team member safety as we begin to reintegrate into our offices over time we paid 1000 bonuses to approximately 106000 domestic frontline team members who support the company’s operations during the pandemic additionally we experienced positive covid19 cases and worker absenteeism throughout our production network during the back half of fiscal 2020 which led to some temporary idling of production facilities we are currently compensating our team members for sick time and covid19 related idling or shift cancellations 

• customers and production – our most significant impacts from covid19 relate to channel shifts and lower production we are committed to doing our best to ensure the continuity of our business and the availability of our products to customers we have seen a shift in demand from our foodservice to our retail sales channels as schools and indining restaurants remain closed or continue to operate at reduced capacity across the country our production capabilities including our large scale and geographic proximities allow us to adapt some of our facilities to the changing demand by shifting certain amounts of production from foodservice to retail not all of our facilities can be adapted and as a result we experienced a net negative impact to our volumes in addition our production facilities experienced varying levels of production impacts including reduced volumes due to the implementation of additional worker health precautions worker absenteeism and temporary covid19 related idling at some of our production facilities additionally we temporarily idled certain facilities shifts and or lines that service the foodservice channel as we balanced the shifting demand between foodservice and retail sales channels on april 28 2020 the president issued an executive order stating the importance of the continued operation of meat and poultry processing facilities and directing the secretary of agriculture to issue rules and orders to ensure the continued supply of meat and poultry consistent with the guidance for the operations of meat and poultry processing facilities jointly issued by the cdc and osha this order provides clarity on what standards should apply at our meat and poultry processing facilities and we anticipate continuing to work with the united states department of agriculture “usda” and other government officials in our efforts to ensure that we are able to operate our facilities safely 

• supply chain – our supply chain has stayed largely intact as we have built contingency plans for redundant supply for our production facilities as well as our external suppliers we have been able to leverage our extensive distribution network and large private transportation fleet to help mitigate the impacts of covid19 we have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in commodity inputs which has impacted our input costs in part due to impacts caused by covid19 production facility downtime in the back half of fiscal 2020 impacted all our segments supply chains our prepared foods segment depends on adequate supplies of raw materials necessary for its production high levels of industry pork facility idling during the back half of fiscal 2020 impacted the availability of certain raw materials which temporarily limited production capability and increased formulation costs of various prepared foods products additionally our chicken segment had to divert some of its live production to rendering and suboptimal product mixes while our beef and pork segments had to delay deliveries of live cattle and hogs and also dealt with the impact of heavier harvest weights since we also export globally container availability and port capacities have been among the challenges in meeting the global demand for our products 

• insurance and cares act – although we maintain insurance policies for various risks we do not believe most covid19 impacts will be covered by our policies on march 27 2020 the president signed into law the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” the cares act among other things includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits deferral of the employer portion of social security payments and a number of income tax provisions the provisions related to income tax will not have a significant impact on our financial statements we began implementing the deferral of the employer portion of social security payments in the back half of the fiscal year which had a favorable impact on liquidity this resulted in the deferral of approximately 185 million of payroll taxes in fiscal 2020 we recognized a benefit of approximately 30 million related to the refundable payroll tax credit provision 

• liquidity – we generated approximately 39 billion of operating cash flows during fiscal 2020 at october 3 2020 we had 32 billion of liquidity which included availability under our revolving credit facility and 1420 million of cash and cash equivalents we have 548 million of current debt combined with the cash expected to be generated from the company’s operations we anticipate that we will maintain sufficient liquidity to operate our business make capital expenditures pay dividends and address other needs including our ability to meet maturing debt obligations however we will continue to monitor the impact of covid19 on our liquidity and if necessary take action to preserve liquidity and ensure that our business can operate during these uncertain times this may include temporarily suspending share repurchases suspending or reducing dividend payments or other cash preservation actions as necessary 

• overall financial condition – we continue to proactively manage the company and its operations through the pandemic the major challenge we face is the availability of team members to operate our production facilities as our production facilities are experiencing varying levels of absenteeism we will continue to operate our production facilities with team member health and safety as a top priority the covid19related slowdowns and temporary idling drive higher labor and production costs which we expect to continue until the return of more normal conditions however some of the higher labor and other costs may become more permanent in nature we also experienced covid19related demand shifts away from foodservice and into retail and we responded to the demand shifts by adjusting parts of our production capacity accordingly despite adjusting parts of our operational footprint higher retail volumes did not fully offset the reduced volumes in foodservice additionally the price and mix of these volume shifts resulted in lower margin realization for portions of the year in our prepared foods and chicken segments further idling of pork facilities could have downstream impacts on the availability of raw material for parts of our prepared foods business which could subsequently impact its ability to produce at normal levels consequently the challenges created by absenteeism and our proactive temporary idling of production facilities due to covid19 adversely affects our operating costs and reduces what would otherwise be a stronger margin environment however we cannot predict the ultimate impact that covid19 will have on our short and longterm demand at this time as it will depend on among other things the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic our liquidity is expected to be adequate to continue to run our operations and meet our obligations as they become due 

fiscal year 

our accounting cycle resulted in a 53week year for fiscal 2020 and a 52week year for fiscal 2019 and 2018 

revision of previously issued financial statements 

the accompanying management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the revision of our previously reported consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 for additional information and a detailed discussion of the revision refer to part ii item 8 notes to the consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of accounting policies 

general 

sales grew 2 in fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019 to 432 billion primarily due to the impact of the additional week and increased average sales prices in the beef pork and prepared foods segments fiscal 2020 operating income increased compared to fiscal 2019 as strong beef and pork segment results were partially offset by a decline in operating income in the chicken and prepared foods segments in fiscal 2020 our results were impacted by 77 million of restructuring and related charges offset by the positive impact of the additional week in fiscal 2019 our results were impacted by a 41 million impairment associated with the planned divestiture of a business 41 million of restructuring and related charges 37 million related to keystone foods purchase accounting and acquisition related costs and 31 million of costs associated with a fire at one of our beef production facilities

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates we have considered the impact of the global covid19 pandemic on our consolidated financial statements in addition to the covid19 impacts we have already experienced and continue to experience there are likely to be future impacts the ultimate extent of which is uncertain and largely subject to whether the severity worsens or duration lengthens these impacts could include but may not be limited to risks and uncertainty related to worker availability our ability to operate production facilities demanddriven production facility closures shifts in demand between sales channels and market volatility in our supply chain consequently this may subject us to future risk of material goodwill intangible and longlived asset impairments increased reserves for uncollectible accounts and adjustments for inventory and market volatility for items subject to fair value measurements such as derivatives and investments the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

contingent liabilities 

description  we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to wage and hourlabor antitrust environmental product taxing authorities and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required if any for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated we disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable 

judgments and uncertainties  our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 

revenue recognition 

description  we recognize revenue for the sale of our product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale revenue is measured by the transaction price which is defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing goods to customers the transaction price is adjusted for estimates of known or expected variable consideration which includes consumer incentives trade promotions and allowances such as coupons discounts rebates volumebased incentives cooperative advertising and other programs variable consideration related to these programs is recorded as a reduction to revenue based on amounts we expect to pay 

judgments and uncertainties  the transaction price contains estimates of known or expected variable consideration we base these estimates on current performance historical utilization and projected redemption rates of each program we review and update these estimates regularly until the incentives or product returns are realized and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material we adopted the fasb’s new guidance on revenue recognition in fiscal 2019 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue during the past three fiscal years 

accrued selfinsurance 

description  we are selfinsured for certain losses related to health and welfare workers’ compensation auto liability and general liability claims we use an independent thirdparty actuary to assist in determining our selfinsurance liability we and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our selfinsurance liability including claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions we periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our thirdparty actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our selfinsurance liability our policy is to maintain an accrual at the actuarial estimated median 

judgments and uncertainties  our selfinsurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used 

costs to settle our obligations including legal and healthcare costs could increase or decrease causing estimates of our selfinsurance liability to change incident rates including frequency and severity could increase or decrease causing estimates in our selfinsurance liability to change 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our selfinsurance liability however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material a 10 change in the actuarial estimate at october 3 2020 would not have a significant impact on our liability 

income taxes 

description  we estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income income tax includes an estimate for withholding taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the united states but does not include an estimate for taxes on earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset we record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 

judgments and uncertainties  changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities to the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 

defined benefit pension plans 

description  we sponsor six defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain team members we also participate in multiemployer plans that provide defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives we use independent thirdparty actuaries to assist us in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost we and the actuaries review assumptions that include estimates of the present value of the projected future pension payment to all plan participants taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience we accumulate and amortize the effect of actuarial gains and losses over future periods net periodic benefit credit for the defined benefit pension plans was 103 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the termination of two of our defined benefit pension plans during fiscal 2020 the projected benefit obligation was 269 million at the end of fiscal 2020 unrecognized actuarial loss was 49 million at the end of fiscal 2020 we currently expect net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2021 to be approximately 11 million we expect to contribute approximately 13 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2021 the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements 

judgments and uncertainties  our defined benefit pension plans contain uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used the key assumptions used in developing the required estimates include such factors as discount rates expected returns on plan assets retirement rates and mortality these assumptions can have a material impact upon the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost the expected liquidation of certain plans has been considered along with these assumptions the discount rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve developed from highquality debt securities were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate in determining the longterm rate of return on plan assets we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans we then determined a longterm projected rateofreturn based on expected returns investment management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality it is reasonably likely that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods 

the risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from singleemployer plans the net pension cost of the multiemployer plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our team members the future cost of these plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions they are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the net periodic benefit cost in future periods a 1 change in the discount rate at october 3 2020 would not have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation or net periodic benefit cost a 1 change in the return on plan assets at october 3 2020 would not have a significant impact on net periodic benefit cost the sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time with the remaining assumptions held constant economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effect of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear 

impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

description  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary if it is determined based on qualitative factors the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macroeconomic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount additionally we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 

for indefinite life intangible assets a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired similar to goodwill we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets outside of the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

judgments and uncertainties  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques with the primary technique being an income approach discounted cash flow method and another technique being a market approach guideline public company method which use significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy we include assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates discount rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets business plans economic projections and marketplace data and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize operating margin assumptions based on future expectations operating margins historically realized in the reporting units’ industries and industry marketplace valuation multiples 

our domestic chicken reporting unit had goodwill at october 3 2020 of 3266 million we generally assumed operating margins in future years would normalize over time as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year we would have failed the quantitative step of the annual impairment test which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss the current year domestic chicken reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to unprecedented market disruptions and incremental costs associated with covid19 which impacts we expect to be mostly temporary in nature to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2020 the domestic chicken reporting unit’s projected longterm operating margins utilizing the discounted cash flow method had to exceed 4 which has been achieved in each of the previous eight fiscal years an increase in the discount rate of approximately 50 basis points would have caused the carrying value of the domestic chicken reporting unit to exceed its discounted cash flows fair value 

our international reporting unit which is presented in internationalother for segment presentation had goodwill at october 3 2020 of 392 million we generally assumed operating margins in future years would increase as we continue to integrate recent acquisitions and implement our international growth strategy as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year we would have failed the quantitative step of the annual impairment test which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss the majority of the international reporting unit including all of its goodwill originated from acquisitions in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 we are still integrating the recent acquisitions and executing our international and global business strategy in addition to managing through the temporary impacts of covid19 to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2020 the international reporting unit projected longterm operating margins utilizing the discounted cash flow method had to exceed 4 an increase in the discount rate of approximately 150 basis points would have caused the carrying value of the international reporting unit to exceed its discounted cash flows fair value 

the fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using multiperiod excess earnings and relieffromroyalty valuation approaches which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 all of our material reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets passed the impairment analysis 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates market ebitda comparables and credit ratings while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value it could result in material impairments of our goodwill 

all of our material reporting units’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination other than the domestic chicken reporting unit consequently other than the domestic chicken reporting unit we do not currently consider any of our other material reporting units at significant risk of impairment 

our fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analyses did not result in an impairment charge all indefinite life intangible assets’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material indefinite life intangible assets at significant risk of impairment 

impairment of longlived assets and definite life intangibles 

description  longlived assets and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset a change in its physical condition or an unexpected change in financial performance 

when evaluating longlived assets and definite life intangibles for impairment we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset for assets held for sale we compare the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 

we recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets and definite life intangibles of 48 million 94 million and 175 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

judgments and uncertainties  our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions including useful lives and intended use of assets observable market valuations forecasted sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of longlived assets or definite life intangibles during the last three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments or useful lives of longlived assets or definite life intangibles however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material we periodically conduct projects to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity manufacturing efficiencies and business technology if we have a significant change in strategies outlook or a manner in which we plan to use these assets we may be exposed to future impairments 

business combinations 

description  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

we use various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as net realizable value to value inventory cost method and market approach to value property relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings to value intangibles and discounted cash flow to value goodwill 

for significant acquisitions we may use independent thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

judgments and uncertainties  significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed particularly intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including sales operating margins attrition rates growth rates and discount rates based on historical results business plans expected synergies perceived risk and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions which could result in subsequent impairments we had no material business combinations during fiscal 2020 










 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and the chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “1934 act” at the time that the original form 10k was filed on november 16 2020 our ceo and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of october 3 2020 subsequent to this evaluation the company’s ceo and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of october 3 2020 solely due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting restated 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the 1934 act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of october 3 2020 in making this assessment we used criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control  integrated framework 2 013 

a material weakness as defined in rule 12b2 under the exchange act is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

we did not design and maintain effective controls over the existence of live cattle inventory specifically we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify the existence of company inventory in the custody of thirdparty live cattle suppliers and appropriately perform the live cattle inventory reconciliation and review at the designed level of precision these deficiencies resulted in a revision related to the overstatement of inventory by approximately 285 million and 179 million as of october 3 2020 and september 28 2019 respectively which also had the effect of understating selling general and administrative expenses by approximately 106 million 57 million and 63 million for the years ended october 3 2020 september 28 2019 and september 29 2018 respectively additionally these deficiencies could result in a misstatement of the abovereferenced account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated statements that would not be prevented or detected 

in managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting included in the original form 10k management including our ceo and cfo concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of october 3 2020 management subsequently concluded that the material weakness described above existed as of october 3 2020 as a result management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 3 2020 based on the criteria in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 version issued by coso accordingly management has restated its report on internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp who audited the fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 financial statements included in this amendment has also audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of october 3 2020 as stated in its report which appears in part ii item 8 of this amendment 

remediation plan 

as part of our commitment to strengthening our internal control over financial reporting we are implementing remedial actions under the oversight of the audit committee of our board of directors to address these deficiencies including 

• implementing a control requiring inspection and physical verification of live cattle on thirdparty feedyards and 

• training on the execution of the company’s key control regarding the reconciliation and review of live cattle inventory including sufficient review based on defined thresholds 

we will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other processes procedures and controls and make any further changes management determines appropriate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in the quarter ended october 3 2020 there have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

during fiscal 2019 we implemented the primary phase of a new enterprise resource planning system “erp” the implementation will continue in additional phases into fiscal 2021 we concluded as part of our evaluation that the implementation of the erp has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting

raw materials and sources of supply 

beef the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions to buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities although we generally expect adequate supply of live cattle in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

pork the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ hog buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the supply of live hogs is adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a small number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of market hogs and live swine for our own processing needs although we generally expect adequate supply of live hogs in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

chicken the primary raw materials used in our domestic chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract farmers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract farmers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing facilities where they are harvested and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2020  corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 53 of our cost of growing a live chicken domestically in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future 

while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

prepared foods the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including beef pork chicken turkey flour vegetables cheese eggs seasonings and other cooking ingredients some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for beef chicken and certain prepared foods products such as hot dogs and smoked sausage generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and certain other prepared foods products such as prepared meals meat dishes appetizers and breakfast sausage generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart inc accounted for 187 of our fiscal 2020 consolidated sales sales to walmart inc were included in all of our segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2020 consolidated sales 

competition 

our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers additionally our food products compete in markets around the world we seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy which includes 

 past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy as supported by our distribution systems the principal competitive elements are price product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of products customer service and credit terms 

foreign operations 

we sold products in approximately 145 countries in fiscal 2020  major sales markets include australia canada central america chile china the european union the united kingdom japan mexico malaysia the middle east south korea taiwan and thailand  we have the following foreign operations 

 we continue to evaluate growth opportunities in foreign locations additional information regarding export sales and longlived assets located in foreign locations is set forth in part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 18 segment reporting 

research and development 

we conduct continuous research and development activities to improve product development to automate manual processes in our processing facilities and growout operations and to improve chicken breeding stock with regards to our food products we have two primary research and development locations our discovery center in springdale arkansas and an innovation center located in downers grove illinois the centers include more than 80000 square feet of united states department of agriculture usda pilot plant space two consumer sensory and focus group areas two packaging labs and 25 research kitchens the centers enable us to bring new marketleading retail and foodservice products to the customer quickly and efficiently additionally in fiscal 2020 we opened the tyson manufacturing automation center to grow the development of new manufacturing solutions and to enhance team member training on new technology 

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing beef pork chicken turkey and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment

congress the united states environmental protection agency and some states continue to consider various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time what options if any will be finalized and whether such options would have a direct impact on the company due to continuing uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect

 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

business  operational risk factors 

the outbreak of the covid19 global pandemic and associated responses has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our business and operations 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected and is expected to continue to negatively affect many parts of our business and operations and has had and continues to have a negative impact on economic activity globally in response to the covid19 pandemic various jurisdictions have attempted to implement or have implemented measures designed to contain the spread of the virus including travel restrictions stayathome or shelterinplace orders and shutdowns of nonessential businesses certain regions in the united states are currently experiencing a resurgence in the covid19 pandemic which may result in the continuation or expansion of such measures these actions and the broader economic impact of the covid19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the extent of future impacts of the covid19 pandemic on general economic conditions and on our business operations and results of operations remains uncertain 

we have experienced and may experience in the future slowdowns and temporary idling of certain of our production facilities due to a number of factors including implementing additional safety measures testing of our team members team member absenteeism and governmental orders during fiscal 2020 we experienced slowdowns and temporary idling of production facilities we anticipate we may experience additional volatility in our ability to operate our facilities at full utilization rates depending on the factors detailed above while the idling and slowdowns impacted our results of operations additional or prolonged idling of facilities or an extended period of operating at a reduced capacity or more significant reductions in our operations at our facilities could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate our business and on our results of operations 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience an increase in operating costs in connection with higher costs associated with ensuring the continued health and safety of team members including by checking team members’ temperatures providing additional personal protective equipment deep cleaning facilities and encouraging sick team members to stay home by providing enhanced team member benefits during fiscal 2020 we incurred direct incremental expenses related to covid19 totaling approximately 540 million which primarily included team member costs associated with worker availability and production facility downtime and direct costs for personal protective equipment production facility sanitization covid19 testing donations product downgrades rendered product professional fees and thank you bonuses to frontline team members we expect to continue to incur significantly increased operating costs related to worker health and safety measures which have had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance that the health and safety measures we have taken which include adding temperature and symptom screening stations for employees prior to entering our facilities and increasing physical distancing of our employees will eradicate the risks associated with working in a critical infrastructure industry including but not limited to infection of our employees or the temporary closure of a facility which could in turn have an adverse impact on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

workforce limitations and travel restrictions resulting from covid19 and related government actions adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact many aspects of our business a number of our team members at various facilities have tested positive for covid19 these team members and in some cases those working in close contact with diagnosed persons are required to be quarantined which has led to a decrease in our available workforce in various locations the decrease in our available workforce has at times adversely impacted our ability to operate our business effectively if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work including because of illness travel or government restrictions in connection with covid19 this could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations in addition certain of our team members who claim to have tested positive for covid19 or their family members have filed lawsuits seeking compensatory and punitive damages for wrongful death and personal injury claims in several states we expect additional team members or family members of team members may assert similar claims as the covid19 pandemic continues if we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims we may experience significant losses and expenses in connection with these lawsuits which could adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

we have also experienced and expect to continue to experience disruption and volatility in our supply chain which has resulted and may continue to result in increased costs for certain raw materials the spread of covid19 has also disrupted and may continue to disrupt logistics necessary to import export and deliver products to us and our customers ports and other channels of entry have been closed or were operating at only a portion of capacity as workers have been prohibited or otherwise unable to report to work and means of transporting products within regions or countries may be limited for the same reason other supply chain risks associated with the covid19 pandemic include but are not limited to shutdowns or reduced operations at our suppliers’ facilities the continued inability of some of our contract producers to manage their livestock supply chain disruptions for feed grains changes in consumer orders due to shifting consumer patterns changes in livestock and protein market prices and additional disruptions in logistics or the distribution chain for our products in addition our operations or those of independent contract poultry producers and producers who provide the live animals to our production operations may become more limited in their ability to procure deliver or produce our food products because of transport restrictions related to quarantines or travel bans and the closure of certain of our production facilities 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have experienced and continue to experience a significant shift in demand for our products from foodservice to retail channels as schools and indining restaurants have closed across the united states and other countries these shifts in demand and other impacts from covid19 have adversely impacted our business as volume increases in our retail channels have not fully offset the losses in foodservice channels we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience temporary idling of facilities or reduction of certain of our production capacity that service the foodservice channel in connection with this change in demand a prolonged shutdown of schools and indining restaurants could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations many large school districts throughout the united states are holding classes remotely and may continue to hold classes remotely if school districts within our foodservice channels continue to hold classes remotely we anticipate we will experience a continued shift away from our foodservice channels which would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations in addition in the event of a protracted period of economic downturn demand for our foodservice products may remain below expectations or decrease further and demand for our retail consumption products may also decrease which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

governmental authorities at the federal state and local levels may increase or impose new or stricter social distancing directives stayathome restrictions travel bans quarantines workforce and workplace restrictions or other measures related to covid19 such actions could cause us to continue to incur additional costs 

we also face other risks associated with the covid19 pandemic including 



 

the severity and duration of the current covid19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response are unknown and are impossible to predict with certainty any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

the integration of recent acquisitions may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the acquisitions may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits including cost synergies 

the success of recent acquisitions including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration failure to effectively integrate the businesses could adversely impact the expected benefits of the acquisitions including cost synergies arising from supply chain efficiencies merchandising activities and overlapping general and administrative functions 

the integration of large businesses is complex and requires us to devote significant management attention and incur substantial costs to integrate these businesses and tyson’s business practices policies cultures and operations this diversion of our management’s attention from daytoday business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives could result in performance shortfalls which could adversely impact the combined company’s business operations and financial results the integration process could also result in the loss of key team members which could adversely impact the combined company’s future financial results 

furthermore during the integration planning process we may encounter additional challenges and difficulties including those related to without limitation managing a larger combined company streamlining supply chains consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating overlapping operations retaining our existing vendors and customers unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems language and translation difficulties and unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to recent acquisitions delays encountered in the integration could adversely impact the business financial condition and operations of the combined company 

we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from recent acquisitions and refine them our actual cost savings could differ materially from our current estimates actual cost savings the costs required to realize the cost savings and the source of the cost savings could differ materially from our estimates and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of cost savings on the schedule anticipated or at all or that these cost savings programs will not have other adverse effects on our business in light of these uncertainties you should not place undue reliance on our estimated cost savings 

finally we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or longterm strategic benefits of the recent acquisitions in a timely manner or at all or could incur higher transition costs than anticipated an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of our financial fitness program which may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 our board of directors approved a multiyear restructuring program the “2017 program” which is expected to contribute to the company’s overall strategy of financial fitness through increased operational effectiveness and overhead reduction in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the company approved a restructuring program the 2020 program which is expected to contribute to the companys overall strategy of financial fitness through the elimination of overhead and consolidation of certain enterprise functions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the company extended the 2020 program as it identified additional opportunities to eliminate overhead by optimizing organizational structures and other activities for more information regarding this program refer to part ii item 8 notes to the consolidated financial statements note 7 restructuring and related charges 

the success of the financial fitness programs including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully implement the program in an efficient and effective manner the implementation of the financial fitness programs may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the financial fitness programs may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits if we are unable to implement the financial fitness programs smoothly or successfully or we otherwise do not capture the anticipated savings our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted 

in addition we may incur higher costs associated with reductions in overhead than anticipated and the reduction in overhead could result in performance shortfalls the financial fitness programs may become a distraction for our organization and may disrupt our ongoing business operations cause deterioration in team member morale disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations and result in negative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation if we are unable to successfully manage the negative consequences of the financial fitness programs our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be adversely affected 

we may experience difficulties in implementing an enterprise resource planning system over the next few years 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of an enterprise resource planning “erp” system during fiscal 2019 we implemented the primary phase and the implementation will continue in additional phases through fiscal 2021 such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial management and personnel perspective the implementation of the erp system may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and there can be no assurance that this system will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations produce financial reports or otherwise operate our business as we implement our new erp system our exposure to system attacks may be elevated because we will be running old and new processes in parallel and must simultaneously protect both the new system and legacy systems if we are unable to implement the erp system smoothly or successfully or we otherwise do not capture anticipated benefits our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted additionally our implementation of the erp system involves greater utilization of thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations problems faced by us or our thirdparty “cloud” computing providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods 

we are subject to risks associated with our international activities which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign locations as well as our operations and assets in such locations 

in fiscal 2020  we sold products to customers in approximately 145 countries major sales markets include australia canada central america chile china the european union the united kingdom japan mexico malaysia the middle east south korea taiwan and thailand  our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2020 totaled 60 billion of which 40 billion related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 1287 million of longlived assets located in foreign locations primarily brazil china the european union and new zealand at the end of fiscal 2020  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 



 negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information technology systems against or effectively respond to cyberattacks other cyber incidents or security breaches or if our information technology systems are otherwise disrupted 

information technology is an important part of our business operations and we increasingly rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements in addition we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities personnel customers and suppliers like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses cyberattacks hackers unauthorized access attempts and other security issues attempted cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise 

we have implemented and continue to evaluate security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks but these measures may not be adequate any significant failure of our systems including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended or our failure to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents could cause transaction errors processing inefficiencies loss of customers and sales have negative consequences on our team members and our business partners have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation and expose us to liability litigation and regulatory enforcement actions in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our business partners customers consumers or suppliers finally the disclosure of nonpublic information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image similar risks exist with respect to the thirdparty vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions including health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions and systems managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions or divestitures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties including 

 we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results additionally from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations

industry risk factors 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition as well as the selling prices for our products are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as beef pork poultry corn soybean meal packaging materials and energy and to a lesser extent cheese fruit seasoning blends flour corn syrup corn oils butter and sugar corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients for instance represented roughly 53 of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2020  

production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control such factors include among other things weather patterns throughout the world outbreaks of disease the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability the company’s objective is to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time however we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors in addition if we increase prices to offset higher costs we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes conversely decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices while we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices 

over time if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program then commodity and raw material price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability financial condition and results of operations 

the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

the food industry in general is intensely competitive we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach some of the factors on which we compete include pricing product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of our products including distribution channels used such as ecommerce and competing products customer service and credit terms 

from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and promotions and new product innovation such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases could harm our profit margins if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer alternatively if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes our revenues and market share could be adversely affected 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and the supply and demand for our products 

supply of and demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or livestock owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers 

failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results 

our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences purchasing behaviors and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want in the channels where they shop we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify develop manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets such as adapting to emerging ecommerce channels our financial results and our competitive position will suffer in addition our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights which could negatively impact our results of operations 

we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments including advertising consumer promotions and trade spend due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising promotions and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices 

our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image 

we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image if we do not maintain or extend our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart inc which accounted for 187 of our sales in fiscal 2020 our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts and if they do sign contracts they generally are limited in scope and duration there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past alternative retail channels such as convenience stores dollar stores drug stores club stores and internetbased retailers have increased their market share 

this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be adversely impacted many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to or adverse change to trade terms with a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products especially during economic downturn may adversely affect our profitability 

in many product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows or if there is a perception of such a narrowing consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us in addition in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more lowerpriced private label or other economy brands to the extent this occurs we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition in times of economic uncertainty consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers which in turn reduces our product sales 

labor  employment risk factors 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our team members 

we have approximately 139000 team members approximately 36000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with team members and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our team members or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

if we are unable to attract hire or retain key team members or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce it could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our continued growth requires us to attract hire retain and develop key team members including our executive officers and senior management team and maintain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to attract and hire highly skilled team members and our own team members are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies competition could cause us to lose talented team members and unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for team members 

we depend on contract farmers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract farmers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with farmers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

legal  regulatory risk factors 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could adversely affect our financial results and damage our reputation 

our products may be subject to contamination by foreign materials or diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the furtherprocessing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results in addition we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil become contaminated are tampered with or are mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products see “environmental regulation and food safety” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us including the united kingdoms exit from the european union could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected for example increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices 

increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us we use natural gas diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures 

legal claims class action lawsuits other regulatory enforcement actions or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

we operate in a highlyregulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our team members contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those contained in item 3 legal proceedings and part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 21 commitments and contingencies in this annual report on form 10k could subject us to civil and criminal penalties including debarment from governmental contracts that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results 

the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation proceedings and investigations 

our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment compliance with these laws and regulations and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations is material to our business new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation assessment or expenditures in addition some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and over time we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities andor waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses the occurrence of any of these events the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial results 

financial risk factors 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan facility and commercial paper program may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates ebitda multiples and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using income and market approaches the income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction the market approach measures value based on what other purchasers in the market have paid for assets or business interests that can be considered reasonably similar to each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates amongst other assumptions disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of october 3 2020  we had 150 billion of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which represented approximately 43 of total assets 

participation in multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business 

we participate in several “multiemployer” pension plans that provide defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements these plans are typically administered by boards of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives we are required to make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in these plans then applicable law could require us to make additional lumpsum contributions to the plans and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plans funding of vested benefits two of the multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal was to occur with respect to the multiemployer plans the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 

volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for team members in the united states the difference between plan obligations and assets which signifies the funded status of the plans is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements as of october 3 2020  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of  234 million  as compared to an underfunded position of  240 million at the end of fiscal 2019  changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that are not hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

general risk factors 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

 extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages decrease in availability of water damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels or unfavorably impact the demand for or our consumers’ ability to purchase our products among other things any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our trade secrets patents and copyrights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions 

we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties which could adversely affect our financial results

we continue to monitor and respond to the evolving nature of covid19 and its impact to our global business we formed an internal covid19 task force for the primary purposes of maintaining the health and safety of our team members ensuring our ability to operate our processing facilities and maintaining the liquidity of our business we have experienced and continue to experience multiple challenges related to the pandemic these challenges increased our operating costs and negatively impacted our sales volumes for the back half of fiscal 2020 and are anticipated to continue into fiscal 2021 operationally we experienced slowdowns and temporary idling of production facilities due to team member absenteeism and choices we made to ensure team member health and safety as a result we have experienced lower levels of productivity and higher costs of production this will likely continue in the short term until the effects of covid19 diminish each of our segments has also experienced a shift in demand from foodservice to retail during 2020 however the volume increases in retail have not been sufficient to offset the decreases in foodservice these current trends including the combination of operational challenges and volume impacts will likely continue into fiscal 2021 and have a negative impact on overall earnings the ultimate impact of covid19 remains uncertain and will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by federal state and local government officials to prevent and manage disease spread all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted 



 fiscal year 

our accounting cycle resulted in a 53week year for fiscal 2020 and a 52week year for fiscal 2019 and 2018 

general 

sales grew 2 in fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019 to 432 billion primarily due to the impact of the additional week and increased average sales prices in the beef pork and prepared foods segments fiscal 2020 operating income increased compared to fiscal 2019  as strong beef and pork segment results were partially offset by a decline in operating income in the chicken and prepared foods segments in fiscal 2020 our results were impacted by 77 million of restructuring and related charges offset by the positive impact of the additional week in fiscal 2019 our results were impacted by a 41 million impairment associated with the planned divestiture of a business 41 million of restructuring and related charges 37 million related to keystone foods purchase accounting and acquisition related costs and 31 million of costs associated with a fire at one of our beef production facilities 

during fiscal 2020 we incurred direct incremental expenses related to covid19 totaling approximately 540 million of which approximately 500 million and 40 million were recorded in cost of sales and selling general and administrative respectively in our consolidated statements of income these covid19 direct incremental expenses primarily included team member costs associated with worker health and availability and production facility downtime including direct costs for personal protection equipment production facility sanitization covid19 testing donations product downgrades rendered product certain professional fees and 114 million of thank you bonuses to frontline team members which was partially offset by the cares act credits due to the nature of these direct incremental covid19 expenses our segments were primarily impacted based on their relative number of team members absenteeism and the degree of production disruptions they have experienced and thus our beef and chicken segments incurred a greater proportion of the total costs these direct incremental covid19 related costs exclude market related impacts that may have been driven in part by covid19 including such items as derivatives deferred compensation investments and other market driven impacts to margin and demand other indirect costs associated with covid19 are not reflected in these amounts including costs associated with raw materials distribution and transportation plant underutilization and reconfiguration premiums paid to cattle producers and pricing discounts 

market environment 

according to the usda domestic protein production beef pork chicken and turkey increased approximately 2 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019  we continue to monitor recent trade and tariff activity as well as covid19 and its potential impacts to exports and input costs across all of our segments additionally all segments experienced increased operating costs in fiscal 2020 we will pursue recovery of these increased costs through pricing the beef and pork segments experienced strong demand but had lower production throughput associated with the impacts of covid19 and also experienced lower livestock costs the chicken segment experienced volatile market conditions associated with increased domestic availability of supply and lower production throughput associated with covid19 the prepared foods segment continued to experience growth in the retail channel but faced increased raw material costs and lower production throughput associated with covid19 

margins – our total operating margin was 72 in fiscal 2020  operating margins by segment were as follows 

 strategy 

our strategy is to sustainably feed the world with the fastest growing protein brands we intend to achieve our strategy as we grow our business through differentiated capabilities deliver ongoing financial fitness through continuous improvement and sustain our company and our world for future generations

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities repurchases of senior notes repayment of maturing debt the payment of dividends and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions in addition we will continue to monitor the impact of covid19 on our liquidity and if necessary take action to preserve liquidity and ensure that our business can operate during these uncertain times this may include temporarily suspending share repurchases suspending or reducing dividend payments or taking other cash preservation actions as necessary 



 





 



 capital resources 

credit and term loan facilities 

cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed capacity of 175 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs and to backstop our commercial paper program additionally we have a 15 billion committed term loan facility which was fully drawn as of october 3 2020 

at october 3 2020  amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit and term loan facilities totaled 175 billion  our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 39 banks with commitments ranging from 03 million to 123 million per bank our term loan facility is funded by a syndicate of 5 banks with commitments ranging from 200 million to 350 million per bank the syndicates include bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements 

commercial paper program 

our commercial paper program provides a lowcost source of borrowing to fund general corporate purposes including working capital requirements the maximum borrowing capacity under the commercial paper program is 1 billion  the maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance as of october 3 2020  we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program our ability to access commercial paper in the future may be limited or its costs increased due to the current market environment which has been impacted in part by covid19 

capitalization 

to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our longterm financing decisions at october 3 2020  and september 28 2019  the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 22x and 29x respectively refer to part ii item 6 selected financial data for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures the decrease in this ratio for fiscal 2020 is due to a decrease in net debt of 1528 million and an increase in ebitda

debt covenants 

our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debttocapitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october 3 2020 and expect that we will maintain compliance 

pension plans 

as further described in part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 16 pensions and other postretirement benefits the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of  234 million at the end of fiscal 2020 as compared to an underfunded position of 240 million at the end of fiscal 2019  we expect to contribute approximately 13 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2021 as compared to approximately 19 million in fiscal 2020  the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements as a result the actual funding in fiscal 2021 may be different from the estimate 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties including leases debt and livestock grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 21 commitments and contingencies for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 3 2020 in millions 

 in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 146 million and related interest and penalties of 51 million at october 3 2020  recorded as liabilities 

the potential maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at october 3 2020  based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 320 million  after analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions we had no allowance for these programs estimated uncollectible receivables at october 3 2020  

recently issuedadopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to the discussion under part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of significant accounting policies and note 2 changes in accounting principles 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates we have considered the impact of the global covid19 pandemic on our consolidated financial statements in addition to the covid19 impacts we have already experienced and continue to experience there are likely to be future impacts the ultimate extent of which is uncertain and largely subject to whether the severity worsens or duration lengthens these impacts could include but may not be limited to risks and uncertainty related to worker availability our ability to operate production facilities demanddriven production facility closures shifts in demand between sales channels and market volatility in our supply chain consequently this may subject us to future risk of material goodwill intangible and longlived asset impairments increased reserves for uncollectible accounts and adjustments for inventory and market volatility for items subject to fair value measurements such as derivatives and investments the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

contingent liabilities 

description  we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to wage and hourlabor antitrust environmental product taxing authorities and other matters and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 

a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required if any for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated we disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable 

judgments and uncertainties  our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 

revenue recognition 

description  we recognize revenue for the sale of our product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale revenue is measured by the transaction price which is defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing goods to customers the transaction price is adjusted for estimates of known or expected variable consideration which includes consumer incentives trade promotions and allowances such as coupons discounts rebates volumebased incentives cooperative advertising and other programs variable consideration related to these programs is recorded as a reduction to revenue based on amounts we expect to pay 

judgments and uncertainties  the transaction price contains estimates of known or expected variable consideration we base these estimates on current performance historical utilization and projected redemption rates of each program we review and update these estimates regularly until the incentives or product returns are realized and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material we adopted the fasb’s new guidance on revenue recognition in fiscal 2019 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue during the past three fiscal years 

accrued selfinsurance 

description  we are selfinsured for certain losses related to health and welfare workers’ compensation auto liability and general liability claims we use an independent thirdparty actuary to assist in determining our selfinsurance liability we and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our selfinsurance liability including claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions we periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our thirdparty actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our selfinsurance liability our policy is to maintain an accrual at the actuarial estimated median 

judgments and uncertainties  our selfinsurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used 

costs to settle our obligations including legal and healthcare costs could increase or decrease causing estimates of our selfinsurance liability to change incident rates including frequency and severity could increase or decrease causing estimates in our selfinsurance liability to change 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our selfinsurance liability however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material a 10 change in the actuarial estimate at october 3 2020 would not have a significant impact on our liability 

income taxes 

description  we estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income income tax includes an estimate for withholding taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the united states but does not include an estimate for taxes on earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset we record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 

judgments and uncertainties  changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities to the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 

defined benefit pension plans 

description  we sponsor six defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain team members we also participate in multiemployer plans that provide defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives we use independent thirdparty actuaries to assist us in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost we and the actuaries review assumptions that include estimates of the present value of the projected future pension payment to all plan participants taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience we accumulate and amortize the effect of actuarial gains and losses over future periods net periodic benefit credit for the defined benefit pension plans was 103 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the termination of two of our defined benefit pension plans during fiscal 2020 the projected benefit obligation was 269 million at the end of fiscal 2020 unrecognized actuarial loss was 49 million at the end of fiscal 2020 we currently expect net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2021 to be approximately 11 million we expect to contribute approximately 13 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2021 the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements 

judgments and uncertainties  our defined benefit pension plans contain uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used the key assumptions used in developing the required estimates include such factors as discount rates expected returns on plan assets retirement rates and mortality these assumptions can have a material impact upon the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost the expected liquidation of certain plans has been considered along with these assumptions the discount rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve developed from highquality debt securities were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate in determining the longterm rate of return on plan assets we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans we then determined a longterm projected rateofreturn based on expected returns investment management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality it is reasonably likely that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods 

the risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from singleemployer plans the net pension cost of the multiemployer plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our team members the future cost of these plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions they are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the net periodic benefit cost in future periods a 1 change in the discount rate at october 3 2020 would not have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation or net periodic benefit cost a 1 change in the return on plan assets at october 3 2020 would not have a significant impact on net periodic benefit cost the sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time with the remaining assumptions held constant economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effect of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear 

impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

description  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary if it is determined based on qualitative factors the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macroeconomic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount additionally we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 

for indefinite life intangible assets a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired similar to goodwill we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets outside of the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

judgments and uncertainties  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques with the primary technique being an income approach discounted cash flow method and another technique being a market approach guideline public company method which use significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy we include assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates discount rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets business plans economic projections and marketplace data and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize operating margin assumptions based on future expectations operating margins historically realized in the reporting units’ industries and industry marketplace valuation multiples 

our domestic chicken reporting unit had goodwill at october 3 2020 of 3266 million we generally assumed operating margins in future years would normalize over time as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year we would have failed the quantitative step of the annual impairment test which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss the current year domestic chicken reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to unprecedented market disruptions and incremental costs associated with covid19 which impacts we expect to be mostly temporary in nature to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2020 the domestic chicken reporting unit’s projected longterm operating margins utilizing the discounted cash flow method had to exceed 4 which has been achieved in each of the previous eight fiscal years an increase in the discount rate of approximately 50 basis points would have caused the carrying value of the domestic chicken reporting unit to exceed its discounted cash flows fair value 

our international reporting unit which is presented in internationalother for segment presentation had goodwill at october 3 2020 of 392 million we generally assumed operating margins in future years would increase as we continue to integrate recent acquisitions and implement our international growth strategy as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year we would have failed the quantitative step of the annual impairment test which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss the majority of the international reporting unit including all of its goodwill originated from acquisitions in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 we are still integrating the recent acquisitions and executing our international and global business strategy in addition to managing through the temporary impacts of covid19 to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2020 the international reporting unit projected longterm operating margins utilizing the discounted cash flow method had to exceed 4 an increase in the discount rate of approximately 150 basis points would have caused the carrying value of the international reporting unit to exceed its discounted cash flows fair value 

the fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using multiperiod excess earnings and relieffromroyalty valuation approaches which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 all of our material reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets passed the impairment analysis 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates market ebitda comparables and credit ratings while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value it could result in material impairments of our goodwill 

all of our material reporting units’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination other than the domestic chicken reporting unit consequently other than the domestic chicken reporting unit we do not currently consider any of our other material reporting units at significant risk of impairment 

our fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analyses did not result in an impairment charge all indefinite life intangible assets’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material indefinite life intangible assets at significant risk of impairment 

impairment of longlived assets and definite life intangibles 

description  longlived assets and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset a change in its physical condition or an unexpected change in financial performance 

when evaluating longlived assets and definite life intangibles for impairment we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset for assets held for sale we compare the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 

we recorded impairment charges related to longlived assets and definite life intangibles of 48 million 94 million and 175 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

judgments and uncertainties  our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions including useful lives and intended use of assets observable market valuations forecasted sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of longlived assets or definite life intangibles during the last three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments or useful lives of longlived assets or definite life intangibles however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material we periodically conduct projects to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity manufacturing efficiencies and business technology if we have a significant change in strategies outlook or a manner in which we plan to use these assets we may be exposed to future impairments 

business combinations 

description  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

we use various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as net realizable value to value inventory cost method and market approach to value property relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings to value intangibles and discounted cash flow to value goodwill 

for significant acquisitions we may use independent thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

judgments and uncertainties  significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed particularly intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including sales operating margins attrition rates growth rates and discount rates based on historical results business plans expected synergies perceived risk and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions which could result in subsequent impairments we had no material business combinations during fiscal 2020 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately 

further we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily forwards and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting we generally do not hedge 

anticipated transactions beyond 18 months the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of october 3 2020 and september 28 2019  on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted forward and option prices the market risk exposure analysis included both derivatives designated as hedge instruments and derivatives not designated as hedge instruments 



interest rate risk at october 3 2020  we had variable rate debt of 1521 million with a weighted average interest rate of 18 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at october 3 2020  and september 28 2019  would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at october 3 2020  we had fixedrate debt of 9818 million with a weighted average interest rate of 442 market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 108 million at october 3 2020  and 184 million at september 28 2019  the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our pension and postretirement benefit obligations changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 16 pensions and other postretirement benefits for additional information 

foreign currency risk we have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currencies we have exposure to are the australian dollar the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro the malaysian ringgit the mexican peso and the thai baht we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have had a 54 million and 15 million impact on pretax income at october 3 2020 and september 28 2019  respectively 

concentrations of credit risk our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at october 3 2020 and september 28 2019  165 and 162  respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart inc no other single customer or customer group represented 10 or greater of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

beef the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities although we generally expect adequate supply of live cattle in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

pork the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ hog buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the supply of live hogs is adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a small number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of market hogs and live swine for our own processing needs although we generally expect adequate supply of live hogs in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

chicken the primary raw materials used in our domestic chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract farmers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract farmers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants where they are harvested and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2019  corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 55 of our cost of growing a live chicken domestically in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future 

while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

prepared foods the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including beef pork chicken turkey flour vegetables cheese eggs seasonings and other cooking ingredients some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for beef chicken and certain prepared foods products such as hot dogs and smoked sausage generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and certain other prepared foods products such as prepared meals meat dishes appetizers and breakfast sausage generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart inc accounted for 169 of our fiscal 2019 consolidated sales sales to walmart inc were included in all of our segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2019 consolidated sales

our facilities for processing beef pork chicken turkey and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment 

we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress the united states environmental protection agency and some states continue to consider various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time what options if any will be finalized and whether such options would have a direct impact on the company due to continuing uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our beef pork chicken and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the united states food and drug administration fda we are also participants in the usdas hazard analysis and critical control points haccp program or fdas hazard analysis and riskbased prevention controls harpc program as applicable and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 additionally our foreign operations are subject to various other food safety and quality assurance oversight and review

cautionary statements relevant to forwardlooking information for the purpose of “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995

among the factors that may cause actual results and experiences to differ from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements are the following i fluctuations in the cost and availability of inputs and raw materials such as live cattle live swine feed grains including corn and soybean meal and energy ii market conditions for finished products including competition from other global and domestic food processors supply and pricing of competing products and alternative proteins and demand for alternative proteins iii outbreak of a livestock disease such as african swine fever asf avian influenza ai or bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse which could have an adverse effect on livestock we own the availability of livestock we purchase consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to access certain domestic and foreign markets iv the effectiveness of our financial fitness program v the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system vi access to foreign markets together with foreign economic conditions including currency fluctuations importexport restrictions and foreign politics vii changes in availability and relative costs of labor and contract farmers and our ability to maintain good relationships with employees labor unions contract farmers and independent producers providing us livestock viii issues related to food safety including costs resulting from product recalls regulatory compliance and any related claims or litigation ix changes in consumer preference and diets and our ability to identify and react to consumer trends x effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs xi our ability to leverage brand value propositions xii risks associated with leverage including cost increases due to rising interest rates or changes in debt ratings or outlook xiii impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets xiv compliance with and changes to regulations and laws both domestic and foreign including changes in accounting standards tax laws environmental laws agricultural laws and occupational health and safety laws xv adverse results from litigation xvi cyber incidents security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology systems xvii our ability to make effective acquisitions or joint ventures and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into existing operations xviii risks associated with our commodity purchasing activities xix the effect of or changes in general economic conditions xx significant marketing plan changes by large customers or loss of one or more large customers xxi impacts on our operations caused by factors and forces beyond our control such as natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemics or extreme weather xxii failure to maximize or assert our intellectual property rights xxiii our participation in multiemployer pension plans xxiv the tyson limited partnership’s ability to exercise significant control over the company xxv effects related to changes in tax rates valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax laws and their interpretation xxvi volatility in capital markets or interest rates xxvii risks associated with our failure to integrate keystone foods’ operations or to realize the targeted cost savings revenues and other benefits of the acquisition and xxviii those factors listed under item 1a “risk factors” 




 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition as well as the selling prices for our products are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as beef pork poultry corn soybean packaging materials and energy and to a lesser extent cheese fruit seasoning blends flour corn syrup corn oils butter and sugar corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients for instance represented roughly 55 of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2019  

production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control such factors include among other things weather patterns throughout the world outbreaks of disease the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability the company’s objective is to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time however we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors in addition if we increase prices to offset higher costs we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes conversely decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices while we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices 

over time if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program then commodity and raw material price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability financial condition and results of operations 

the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

the food industry in general is intensely competitive we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach some of the factors on which we compete include pricing product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of our products including distribution channels used such as ecommerce and competing products customer service and credit terms 

from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and promotions and new product innovation such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases could harm our profit margins if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer alternatively if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes our revenues and market share could be adversely affected 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and the supply and demand for our products 

supply of and demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or livestock owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

the integration of recent acquisitions may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the acquisitions may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits including cost synergies 

the success of recent acquisitions including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration failure to effectively integrate the businesses could adversely impact the expected benefits of the acquisitions including cost synergies arising from supply chain efficiencies merchandising activities and overlapping general and administrative functions 

the integration of large businesses is complex and requires us to devote significant management attention and incur substantial costs to integrate these businesses and tyson’s business practices policies cultures and operations this diversion of our management’s attention from daytoday business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives could result in performance shortfalls which could adversely impact the combined company’s business operations and financial results the integration process could also result in the loss of key employees which could adversely impact the combined company’s future financial results 

furthermore during the integration planning process we may encounter additional challenges and difficulties including those related to without limitation managing a larger combined company streamlining supply chains consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating overlapping operations retaining our existing vendors and customers unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems language and translation difficulties and unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to recent acquisitions delays encountered in the integration could adversely impact the business financial condition and operations of the combined company 

we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from recent acquisitions and refine them our actual cost savings could differ materially from our current estimates actual cost savings the costs required to realize the cost savings and the source of the cost savings could differ materially from our estimates and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of cost savings on the schedule anticipated or at all or that these cost savings programs will not have other adverse effects on our business in light of these uncertainties you should not place undue reliance on our estimated cost savings 

finally we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or longterm strategic benefits of the recent acquisitions in a timely manner or at all or could incur higher transition costs than anticipated an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of our financial fitness program which may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 our board of directors approved a multiyear restructuring program the “financial fitness program” which is expected to contribute to the company’s overall strategy of financial fitness through increased operational effectiveness and overhead reduction for more information regarding this program refer to the heading “overview” set forth in part ii “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this report 

the success of the financial fitness program including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully implement the program in an efficient and effective manner the implementation of the financial fitness program may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the financial fitness program may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits if we are unable to implement the financial fitness program smoothly or successfully or we otherwise do not capture the anticipated savings our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted 

in addition we may incur higher costs associated with reductions in overhead than anticipated and the reduction in overhead could result in performance shortfalls the financial fitness program may become a distraction for our organization and may disrupt our ongoing business operations cause deterioration in employee morale disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations and result in negative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation if we are unable to successfully manage the negative consequences of the financial fitness program our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be adversely affected 

we may experience difficulties in implementing an enterprise resource planning system over the next few years 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of an enterprise resource planning “erp” system such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial management and personnel perspective the implementation of the erp system may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and there can be no assurance that this system will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations produce financial reports or otherwise operate our business as we implement our new erp system our exposure to system attacks may be elevated because we will be running old and new processes in parallel and must simultaneously protect both the new system and legacy systems if we are unable to implement the erp system smoothly or successfully or we otherwise do not capture anticipated benefits our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted additionally our implementation of the erp system involves greater utilization of thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations problems faced by us or our thirdparty “cloud” computing providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods 

we are subject to risks associated with our international activities which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign locations as well as our operations and assets in such locations 

in fiscal 2019  we sold products to customers in approximately 145 countries major sales markets include australia canada central america china the european union japan malaysia mexico chile the middle east the netherlands south korea taiwan and thailand our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2019 totaled 54 billion  of which 41 billion related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 1107 million of longlived assets located in foreign locations primarily brazil china the european union and new zealand at the end of fiscal 2019  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 141000 employees approximately 39000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

if we are unable to attract hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce it could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our continued growth requires us to attract hire retain and develop key employees including our executive officers and senior management team and maintain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to attract and hire highly skilled employees and our own employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies competition could cause us to lose talented employees and unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees 

we depend on contract farmers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract farmers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with farmers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could adversely affect our financial results and damage our reputation 

our products may be subject to contamination by foreign materials or diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the furtherprocessing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results in addition we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil become contaminated are tampered with or are mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers 

failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results 

our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences purchasing behaviors and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want in the channels where they shop we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify develop manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets such as adapting to emerging ecommerce channels our financial results and our competitive position will suffer in addition our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights which could negatively impact our results of operations 

we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments including advertising consumer promotions and trade spend due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising promotions and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices 

our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image 

we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image if we do not maintain or extend our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products especially during economic downturn may adversely affect our profitability 

in many product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows or if there is a perception of such a narrowing consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us in addition in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more lowerpriced private label or other economy brands to the extent this occurs we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition in times of economic uncertainty consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers which in turn reduces our product sales 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates ebitda multiples and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using an income approach the income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates amongst other assumptions disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future which could be substantial 

as of september 28 2019  we had 149 billion of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which represented approximately 45 of total assets 

new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products see “environmental regulation and food safety” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k for more information changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us including the united kingdoms potential exit from the european union could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected for example increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices 

increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us we use natural gas diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures 

legal claims class action lawsuits other regulatory enforcement actions or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

we operate in a highlyregulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those contained in item 3 legal proceedings and part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies in this annual report on form 10k could subject us to civil and criminal penalties including debarment from governmental contracts that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results 

the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation proceedings and investigations 

our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment compliance with these laws and regulations and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations is material to our business new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation assessment or expenditures in addition some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and over time we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities andor waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses the occurrence of any of these events the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial results 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information technology systems against or effectively respond to cyberattacks other cyber incidents or security breaches or if our information technology systems are otherwise disrupted 

information technology is an important part of our business operations and we increasingly rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements in addition we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities personnel customers and suppliers like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses cyberattacks hackers unauthorized access attempts and other security issues attempted cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise 

we have implemented and continue to evaluate security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks but these measures may not be adequate any significant failure of our systems including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended or our failure to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents could cause transaction errors processing inefficiencies loss of customers and sales have negative consequences on our employees and our business partners have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation and expose us to liability litigation and regulatory enforcement actions in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our business partners customers consumers or suppliers finally the disclosure of nonpublic information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image similar risks exist with respect to the thirdparty vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions including health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions and systems managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions or divestitures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties including 

 we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

additionally from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that are not hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 



 the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart inc which accounted for 169 of our sales in fiscal 2019  our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts and if they do sign contracts they generally are limited in scope and duration there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past alternative retail channels such as convenience stores dollar stores drug stores club stores and internetbased retailers have increased their market share 

this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be adversely impacted many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to or adverse change to trade terms with a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages decrease in availability of water damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels or unfavorably impact the demand for or our consumers’ ability to purchase our products among other things any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our trade secrets patents and copyrights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions 

we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

participation in multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business 

we participate in several “multiemployer” pension plans that provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by collective bargaining agreements these plans are typically administered by boards of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives we are required to make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in these plans then applicable law could require us to make additional lumpsum contributions to the plans and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plans funding of vested benefits two of the multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal was to occur with respect to the multiemployer plans the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 

tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control 

as of september 28 2019  tyson limited partnership the tlp owns 99985 of the outstanding shares of the companys class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and the tlp and members of the tyson family own in the aggregate 215 of the outstanding shares of the companys class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them collectively control of approximately 7097 of the total voting power of the companys outstanding voting stock at this time the tlp does not have a managing general partner as such the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners as of september 28 2019  mr john tyson chairman of the board of directors has 3333 of the general partner percentage interests and ms barbara tyson a director of the company has 11115 general partner percentage interests the remaining general partnership interests are held by the donald j tyson revocable trust 4444 and harry c erwin iii 11115 as a result of these holdings positions and directorships the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tlps significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we are eligible for “controlled company” exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties which could adversely affect our financial results 

volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states the difference between plan obligations and assets which signifies the funded status of the plans is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements as of september 28 2019  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of  240 million  as compared to an underfunded position of  162 million at the end of fiscal 2018  changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities the repurchases of senior notes and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions 



 



 





 capital resources 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed capacity of 175 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs and to backstop our commercial paper program as of september 28 2019  we had 70 million in borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility which left 168 billion available for borrowing before deducting amounts to backstop our commercial paper program our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 39 banks with commitments ranging from 03 million to 123 million per bank the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements 

commercial paper program 

our commercial paper program provides a lowcost source of borrowing to fund general corporate purposes including working capital requirements the maximum borrowing capacity under the commercial paper program is 1 billion  the maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance as of september 28 2019  1 billion was outstanding under this program with maturities less than 25 days 

capitalization 

to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our longterm financing decisions at september 28 2019  and september 29 2018  the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 29x and 24x respectively refer to part ii item 6 selected financial data for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures the increase in this ratio for fiscal 2019 is due to an increase in net debt of 1845 million 

credit ratings 

revolving credit facility 

standard  poors rating services a standard  poors financial services llc business sp corporate credit rating is bbb moody’s investor service incs moodys applicable rating is baa2 fitch ratings a wholly owned subsidiary of fimlac sa fitch applicable rating is bbb the below table outlines the fees paid on the unused portion of the facility facility fee rate and letter of credit fees and borrowings undrawn letter of credit fee and borrowing spread that corresponds to the applicable ratings levels from sp moodys and fitch 



in the event the rating levels are split the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level in effect for two of the rating agencies or if all three rating agencies have different rating levels the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level that is between the rating levels of the other two rating agencies 

debt covenants 

our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debttocapitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september 28 2019  

pension plans 

as further described in part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pensions and other postretirement benefits the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of  240 million at the end of fiscal 2019 as compared to an underfunded position of 162 million at the end of fiscal 2018  we expect to contribute approximately 33 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2020 as compared to approximately 13 million in fiscal 2019  the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements as a result the actual funding in fiscal 2020 may be different from the estimate 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties including leases debt and livestock grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of september 28 2019  

 in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 149 million and related interest and penalties of 46 million at september 28 2019  recorded as liabilities 

the potential maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at september 28 2019  based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 300 million  after analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions we had no allowance for these programs estimated uncollectible receivables at september 28 2019  

recently issuedadopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to the discussion under part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of significant accounting policies and note 2 changes in accounting principles 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 




















 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will be offset either against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities related to interest rates are recorded in interest expense changes in the market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities related to foreign exchange contracts are recorded in other net 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 28 2019 and september 29 2018  on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis included hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 



interest rate risk at september 28 2019  we had variable rate debt of 1875 million with a weighted average interest rate of 25 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at september 28 2019  and september 29 2018  would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at september 28 2019  we had fixedrate debt of 10057 million with a weighted average interest rate of 442 market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 184 million at september 28 2019  and 207 million at september 29 2018  the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

we have 400 million total notional amount of interest rate swaps at september 28 2019 as part of our risk management activities to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our pension and postretirement benefit obligations changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pensions and other postretirement benefits for additional information 

foreign currency risk we have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances as well as revenues and expenses the primary currencies we have exposure to are the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the thai baht the malaysian ringgit the european euro the japanese yen the new zealand dollar the australian dollar and the mexican peso we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at september 28 2019 and september 29 2018  related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have a 15 million and 9 million impact respectively on pretax income 

concentrations of credit risk our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at september 28 2019 and september 29 2018  162 and 186  respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart inc no other single customer or customer group represented 10 or greater of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

beef  the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities although we generally expect adequate supply of live cattle in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

pork  the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ hog buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the supply of live hogs is adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a small number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of market hogs and live swine for our own processing needs although we generally expect adequate supply of live hogs in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

chicken  the primary raw materials used in our domestic chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants where they are harvested and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2018  corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 56  of our cost of growing a live chicken domestically in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future 

while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

prepared foods  the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including beef pork chicken turkey corn flour vegetables bread breading cheese eggs seasonings and other cooking ingredients some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for beef chicken and certain prepared foods products such as hot dogs and smoked sausage generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and certain other prepared foods products such as prepared meals meat dishes appetizers and breakfast sausage generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart inc accounted for 173  of our fiscal 2018  consolidated sales sales to walmart inc were included in all of our segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2018  consolidated sales 

competition 

our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers additionally our food products compete in markets around the world 

we seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy which includes 

 past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy as supported by our distribution systems the principal competitive elements are price product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of products customer service and credit terms

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing beef pork chicken turkey and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment 

we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress the united states environmental protection agency and some states continue to consider various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time what options if any will be finalized and whether such options would have a direct impact on the company due to continuing uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our beef pork chicken and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the united states food and drug administration fda we are also participants in the usdas haccp program or fdas harpc program as applicable and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 additionally our foreign operations are subject to various other food safety and quality assurance oversight and review

we have the ability to produce and ship fresh frozen and refrigerated products worldwide domestically our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our owned or leased cold storage warehouses public cold storage facilities and our transportation system our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate partialtruckload orders into full truckloads thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service in addition we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental united states internationally we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations 

patents and trademarks 

we have filed a number of patent applications relating to our processes and products that either have been approved or are in the process of review because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our products we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts and have registered and applied for the registration of a number of trademarks we also have developed nonpublic proprietary information regarding our production processes and other productrelated matters we utilize internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information and where appropriate seek patent andor other protection for the technology we utilize

cautionary statements relevant to forwardlooking information for the purpose of “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

certain information in this report constitutes forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to current views and estimates of our outlook for fiscal 2019 other future economic circumstances industry conditions in domestic and international markets our performance and financial results eg debt levels return on invested capital valueadded product growth capital expenditures tax rates access to foreign markets and dividend policy these forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and experiences to differ materially from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements we wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date made we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

among the factors that may cause actual results and experiences to differ from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements are the following i fluctuations in the cost and availability of inputs and raw materials such as live cattle live swine feed grains including corn and soybean meal and energy ii market conditions for finished products including competition from other global and domestic food processors supply and pricing of competing products and alternative proteins and demand for alternative proteins iii outbreak of a livestock disease such as avian influenza ai or bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse which could have an adverse effect on livestock we own the availability of livestock we purchase consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to access certain domestic and foreign markets iv the integration of acquisitions v the effectiveness of our financial fitness program vi the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system vii access to foreign markets together with foreign economic conditions including currency fluctuations importexport restrictions and foreign politics viii changes in availability and relative costs of labor and contract growers and our ability to maintain good relationships with employees labor unions contract growers and independent producers providing us livestock ix issues related to food safety including costs resulting from product recalls regulatory compliance and any related claims or litigation x changes in consumer preference and diets and our ability to identify and react to consumer trends xi effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs xii our ability to leverage brand value propositions xiii risks associated with leverage including cost increases due to rising interest rates or changes in debt ratings or outlook xiv impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets xv compliance with and changes to regulations and laws both domestic and foreign including changes in accounting standards tax laws environmental laws agricultural laws and occupational health and safety laws xvi adverse results from litigation xvii cyber incidents security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology systems xviii our ability to make effective acquisitions or joint ventures and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into existing operations xix risks associated with our commodity purchasing activities xx the effect of or changes in general economic conditions xxi significant marketing plan changes by large customers or loss of one or more large customers xxii impacts on our operations caused by factors and forces beyond our control such as natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemics or extreme weather xxiii failure to maximize or assert our intellectual property rights xxiv our participation in a multiemployer pension plan xxv the tyson limited partnership’s ability to exercise significant control over the company xxvi effects related to changes in tax rates valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax laws and their interpretation xxvii volatility in capital markets or interest rates xxviii impacts or disruptions associated with the announcement and pendency of the acquisition of keystone foods xxix the successful acquisition of keystone foods xxx risks associated with our failure to integrate keystone foods’ operations or to realize the targeted cost savings revenues and other benefits of the acquisition and xxxi those factors listed under item 1a “risk factors” 




 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition as well as the selling prices for our products are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as beef pork poultry corn soybean packaging materials and energy and to a lesser extent cheese fruit seasoning blends flour corn syrup corn oils butter and sugar corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients for instance represented roughly 56  of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2018  

production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control such factors include among other things weather patterns throughout the world outbreaks of disease the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability the company’s objective is to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time however we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors in addition if we increase prices to offset higher costs we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes conversely decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices while we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices 

over time if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program then commodity and raw material price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability financial condition and results of operations 

the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

the food industry in general is intensely competitive we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach some of the factors on which we compete include pricing product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of our products including distribution channels used such as ecommerce and competing products customer service and credit terms 

from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and promotions and new product innovation such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases could harm our profit margins if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer alternatively if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes our revenues and market share could be adversely affected 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and the supply and demand for our products 

supply of and demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or livestock owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

the integration of recent acquisitions may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the acquisition may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits including cost synergies 

the success of recent acquisitions including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration failure to effectively integrate the businesses could adversely impact the expected benefits of the acquisitions including cost synergies arising from supply chain efficiencies merchandising activities and overlapping general and administrative functions 

the integration of large companies is complex and we will be required to devote significant management attention and incur substantial costs to integrate these businesses and tyson’s business practices policies cultures and operations this diversion of our management’s attention from daytoday business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives could result in performance shortfalls which could adversely impact the combined company’s business operations and financial results the integration process could also result in the loss of key employees which could adversely impact the combined company’s future financial results 

furthermore during the integration planning process we may encounter additional challenges and difficulties including those related to without limitation managing a larger combined company streamlining supply chains consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating overlapping operations retaining our existing vendors and customers unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems and unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to recent acquisitions delays encountered in the integration could adversely impact the business financial condition and operations of the combined company 

we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from recent acquisitions and refine them our actual cost savings could differ materially from our current estimates actual cost savings the costs required to realize the cost savings and the source of the cost savings could differ materially from our estimates and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of cost savings on the schedule anticipated or at all or that these cost savings programs will not have other adverse effects on our business in light of these uncertainties you should not place undue reliance on our estimated cost savings 

finally we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or longterm strategic benefits of the recent acquisitions in a timely manner or at all or could incur higher transition costs than anticipated an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of our financial fitness program which may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 our board of directors approved a multiyear restructuring program the “financial fitness program” which is expected to contribute to the company’s overall strategy of financial fitness through increased operational effectiveness and overhead reduction for more information regarding this program refer to the heading “overview” set forth in part ii “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this report 

the success of the financial fitness program including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully implement the program in an efficient and effective manner the implementation of the financial fitness program may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the financial fitness program may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits if we are unable to implement the financial fitness program smoothly or successfully or we otherwise do not capture the anticipated savings our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted 

in addition we may incur higher costs associated with reductions in overhead than anticipated and the reduction in overhead could result in performance shortfalls the financial fitness program may become a distraction for our organization and may disrupt our ongoing business operations cause deterioration in employee morale disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations and result in negative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation if we are unable to successfully manage the negative consequences of the financial fitness program our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be adversely affected 

we may experience difficulties in implementing an enterprise resource planning system over the next few years 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of an enterprise resource planning “erp” system such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial management and personnel perspective the implementation of the erp system may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and there can be no assurance that this system will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations produce financial reports or otherwise operate our business as we implement our new erp system our exposure to system attacks may be elevated because we will be running old and new processes in parallel and must simultaneously protect both the new system and legacy systems if we are unable to implement the erp system smoothly or successfully or we otherwise do not capture anticipated benefits our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted additionally our implementation of the erp system may involve greater utilization of thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations problems faced by us or our thirdparty “cloud” computing providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods 

we are subject to risks associated with our international activities which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2018  we sold products to approximately 125  countries major sales markets include canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east south korea and taiwan our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2018  totaled 48 billion of which 42 billion  related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 212 million  of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily brazil china european union and new zealand at the end of fiscal 2018  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 121000  employees approximately 33000  of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

if we are unable to attract hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce it could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our continued growth requires us to attract hire retain and develop key employees including our executive officers and senior management team and maintain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to attract and hire highly skilled employees and our own employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies competition could cause us to lose talented employees and unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees 

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could adversely affect our financial results and damage our reputation 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the furtherprocessing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results in addition we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil become contaminated are tampered with or are mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers 

failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results 

our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences purchasing behaviors and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want in the channels where they shop we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify develop manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets such as adapting to emerging ecommerce channels our financial results and our competitive position will suffer in addition our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights which could negatively impact our results of operations 

we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments including advertising consumer promotions and trade spend due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising promotions and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices 

our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image 

we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image if we do not maintain or extend our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products especially during economic downturn may adversely affect our profitability 

in many product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows or if there is a perception of such a narrowing consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us in addition in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more lowerpriced private label or other economy brands to the extent this occurs we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition in times of economic uncertainty consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers which in turn reduces our product sales 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates ebitda multiples and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using an income approach the income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of september 29 2018  we had 138 billion  of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which represented approximately 47  of total assets 

new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products see “environmental regulation and food safety” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected for example increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices 

increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us we use natural gas diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures 

legal claims class action lawsuits other regulatory enforcement actions or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

we operate in a highlyregulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those contained in item 3 legal proceedings and part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies in this annual report on form 10k could subject us to civil and criminal penalties including debarment from governmental contracts that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results 

the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation proceedings and investigations 

our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment compliance with these laws and regulations and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations is material to our business new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation assessment or expenditures in addition some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and over time we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities andor waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses the occurrence of any of these events the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial results 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information technology systems against or effectively respond to cyberattacks other cyber incidents or security breaches or if our information technology systems are otherwise disrupted 

information technology is an important part of our business operations and we increasingly rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements in addition we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities personnel customers and suppliers like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses cyberattacks hackers unauthorized access attempts and other security issues attempted cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise 

we have implemented and continue to evaluate security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks but these measures may not be adequate any significant failure of our systems including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended or our failure to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents could cause transaction errors processing inefficiencies loss of customers and sales have negative consequences on our employees and our business partners have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation and expose us to liability litigation and regulatory enforcement actions in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our business partners customers consumers or suppliers finally the disclosure of nonpublic information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image similar risks exist with respect to the thirdparty vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions including health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions and systems managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions or divestitures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties including 

 we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results in august 2018 the company announced it had reached a definitive agreement to buy the keystone foods business “keystone” from marfrig global foods for 216 billion in cash the acquisition of keystone a major supplier to the growing global foodservice industry is our latest investment in furtherance of our growth strategy and expansion of our valueadded protein capabilities the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter or early second quarter of fiscal 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals however there can be no assurance that the acquisition will close at such time 

additionally from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that are not hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 



the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart inc which accounted for 173  of our sales in fiscal 2018  our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts and if they do sign contracts they generally are limited in scope and duration there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past alternative retail channels such as convenience stores dollar stores drug stores club stores and internetbased retailers   have increased their market share 

this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be adversely impacted many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to or adverse change to trade terms with a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages decrease in availability of water damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels or unfavorably impact the demand for or our consumers’ ability to purchase our products among other things any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our trade secrets patents and copyrights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions 

we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

participation in a multiemployer pension plan could adversely affect our business 

through our wholly owned subsidiary hillshire brands we participate in a “multiemployer” pension plan administered by a labor union representing some of its employees we are required to make periodic contributions to this plan to allow it to meet its pension benefit obligations to its participants our required contributions to this fund could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to this fund inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plans funding of vested benefits the multiemployer plan in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal was to occur with respect to the multiemployer plan the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 

tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control 

as of september 29 2018  tyson limited partnership the tlp owns 99985  of the outstanding shares of the companys class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and the tlp and members of the tyson family own in the aggregate 209  of the outstanding shares of the companys class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them collectively control of approximately 7096  of the total voting power of the companys outstanding voting stock at this time the tlp does not have a managing general partner as such the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners as of september 29 2018  mr john tyson chairman of the board of directors has 3333 of the general partner percentage interests and ms barbara tyson a director of the company has 11115 general partner percentage interests the remaining general partnership interests are held by the donald j tyson revocable trust 4444 and harry c erwin iii 11115 as a result of these holdings positions and directorships the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tlps significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we are eligible for “controlled company” exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties which could adversely affect our financial results 

volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states the difference between plan obligations and assets which signifies the funded status of the plans is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements as of september 29 2018  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of  162 million  as compared to an underfunded position of  195 million  at the end of fiscal 2017  changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements 

the announcement and pendency of the keystone acquisition could impact or cause disruptions in our and keystone’s businesses 

specifically 

 in connection with the keystone acquisition we could also encounter additional transaction and integrationrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the keystone acquisition as described in more detail below 

the keystone acquisition may not be successful 

we recently announced our entry into a share purchase agreement to acquire keystone risks associated with the keystone acquisition include the risk that the transaction may not be consummated the risk that regulatory approval that may be required for the transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to certain conditions that are not anticipated litigation risk associated with claims or potential claims brought by shareholders of keystone to enjoin the transaction or seek monetary damages and risks associated with our ability to issue debt to fund a portion of the purchase price 

if the keystone acquisition is consummated we may be unable to successfully integrate keystone’s operations or to realize targeted cost savings revenues and other benefits of the keystone acquisition 

we entered into the share purchase agreement for keystone because we believe that the keystone acquisition will be beneficial to us and our stockholders achieving the targeted benefits of the keystone acquisition will depend in part upon whether we can integrate keystone’s businesses in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration we and keystone operate numerous systems including those involving management information purchasing accounting and finance sales billing employee benefits payroll and regulatory compliance moreover the integration of our respective operations will require the dedication of significant management resources which is likely to distract management’s attention from daytoday operations employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt our business and result in undesired employee attrition an inability of management to successfully integrate the operations of the two companies could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations and financial condition of the combined businesses 

in addition we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from the keystone acquisition and refine them so that our actual costsavings could differ materially from our current estimates actual costsavings the costs required to realize the cost savings and the source of the costsavings could differ materially from our estimates and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of costsavings on the schedule anticipated or at all or that these costsavings programs will not have other adverse effects on our business in light of these uncertainties you should not place undue reliance on our estimated costsavings 

finally we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or longterm strategic benefits of the keystone acquisition or could incur higher transition costs an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the keystone acquisition as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we will incur significant transaction and acquisitionrelated costs in connection with the keystone acquisition 

we expect to incur significant costs associated with the keystone acquisition and combining the operations of the two companies including costs to achieve targeted costsavings the substantial majority of the expenses resulting from the keystone acquisition will be composed of transaction costs related to the keystone acquisition systems consolidation costs and business integration and employmentrelated costs including costs for severance retention and other restructuring we may also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset incremental transaction and acquisitionrelated costs over time this net benefit 

may not be achieved in the near term or at all

2018  2017  2016  – interest income remained relatively flat as lower deposit levels offset higher interest rates 



2018  2017  2016   –

our effective income tax rate was 103 for fiscal 2018 compared to 323 for fiscal 2017 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 reflects impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act signed into law on december 22 2017 these impacts include a 1004 million benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred taxes existing at the date of enactment which reduced the fiscal year effective tax rate by 366 as well as a 245 statutory federal income tax rate for fiscal 2018 compared to the 35 statutory federal income tax rate effective for the prior year additionally current year favorable timing differences currently deductible at the 245 blended tax rate but reversing in future years at 21 reduced the fiscal 2018 rate 13 the nondeductible impairment and sale of certain assets in our nonprotein businesses increased the fiscal 2018 rate 31 

the fiscal 2018 effective tax rate also includes a 17 benefit related to domestic production activity deduction which is less than the 31 benefit in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the lower enacted federal tax rate the fiscal 2018 effective tax rate includes 33 expense for state taxes net of federal tax benefit compared to 23 in fiscal 2017 this increase is also due in part to the lower enacted federal tax rate 

the fiscal 2017 effective tax rate was 323 compared to 318 in fiscal 2016 this change was due in part to 17 benefit for unrecognized tax benefits activity in fiscal 2016 that didn’t recur in fiscal 2017 partially offset by more favorable domestic production activity deduction and state income taxes in 2017 

we currently expect an annual effective tax rate of approximately 235 in 2019 for further description of drivers for these rates refer to part i item 1 notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements note 9 income taxes

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities the repurchases of senior notes repayment of term loans and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions 





 







 

 capital resources 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed capacity of 175 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs and to backstop our commercial paper program 

as of september 29 2018  we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility which left 175 billion available for borrowing before deducting amounts to backstop our commercial paper program our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 39 banks with commitments ranging from 03 million to 123 million per bank the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements 

commercial paper program 

our commercial paper program provides a lowcost source of borrowing to fund general corporate purposes including working capital requirements the maximum borrowing capacity under the commercial paper program is 1 billion  the maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance as of september 29 2018  605 million  was outstanding under this program with maturities less than 25  days 

capitalization 

to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our longterm financing decisions at september 29 2018  and september 30 2017  the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 24x  and 27x respectively refer to part ii item 6 selected financial data for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures the decrease in this ratio for fiscal 2018  is due to a decrease in net debt of 280 million and an increase in ebitda of 373 million 

credit ratings 

revolving credit facility 

standard  poors rating services a standard  poors financial services llc business sp corporate credit rating for tyson foods inc is bbb moody’s investor service incs moodys senior unsecured longterm debt rating for tyson foods inc is baa2 fitch ratings a wholly owned subsidiary of fimlac sa fitch issuer default rating for tyson foods inc is bbb the below table outlines the fees paid on the unused portion of the facility facility fee rate and letter of credit fees undrawn letter of credit fee and borrowing spread depending on the rating levels of tyson foods inc from sp moodys and fitch 



in the event the rating levels are split the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level in effect for two of the rating agencies or if all three rating agencies have different rating levels the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level that is between the rating levels of the other two rating agencies 

debt covenants 

our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debttocapitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september 29 2018  

pension plans 

as further described in part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pensions and other postretirement benefits the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of  162 million  at the end of fiscal 2018  as compared to an underfunded position of 195 million  at the end of fiscal 2017  

we expect to contribute approximately 15 million  of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2019  as compared to approximately 29 million  in fiscal 2018  and 53 million  in fiscal 2017  the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements as a result the actual funding in fiscal 2019  may be different from the estimate 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties including leases and grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of september 29 2018  

 in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 288 million and related interest and penalties of 73 million at september 29 2018  recorded as liabilities 

the potential maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at september 29 2018  based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 300 million  after analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions we had no  allowance for these programs estimated uncollectible receivables at september 29 2018  

recently issuedadopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to the discussion under part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of significant accounting policies and note 2 changes in accounting principles 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 












 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities related to interest rates are recorded in interest expense 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk  we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 29 2018  and september 30 2017  on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis included hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 



interest rate risk  at september 29 2018  we had variable rate debt of  1655 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 26  a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at september 29 2018  and september 30 2017  would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at september 29 2018  we had fixedrate debt of  8218 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 41  market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately  207 million  at september 29 2018  and 150 million at september 30 2017  the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

in fiscal 2018 as part of our risk management activities we executed derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates at september 29 2018  the total notional amount of interest rate swaps remaining outstanding was 400 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our pension and postretirement benefit obligations changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pensions and other postretirement benefits for additional information 

foreign currency risk  we have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currencies we have exposure to are the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro the japanese yen and the mexican peso we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at september 29 2018  and september 30 2017  related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have a 9 million and 7 million impact respectively on pretax income 

concentrations of credit risk  our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at september 29 2018  and september 30 2017  186  of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart inc no other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

beef  the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities although we generally expect adequate supply of live cattle in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

pork  the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ hog buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the supply of live hogs is adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a small number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of market hogs and live swine for our own processing needs 

chicken  the primary raw materials used in our domestic chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants where they are harvested and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2017  corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 55  of our cost of growing a live chicken domestically in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase icepacked or deboned chicken including no antibiotics ever sometimes referred to as nae certified chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

prepared foods  the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including beef pork chicken turkey corn flour vegetables bread breading cheese eggs seasonings and other cooking ingredients some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for beef chicken and certain prepared foods products such as hot dogs and smoked sausage generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and certain other prepared foods products such as prepared meals meat dishes appetizers frozen pies and breakfast sausage generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for 173  of our fiscal 2017  consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in all of our segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2017  consolidated sales

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing beef pork chicken turkey and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress the united states environmental protection agency and some states continue to consider various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time what options if any will be finalized and whether such options would have a direct impact on the company due to continuing uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our beef pork chicken and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the united states food and drug administration we are also participants in the united states hazard analysis critical control point program and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 additionally our foreign operations are subject to various other food safety and quality assurance oversight and review

cautionary statements relevant to forwardlooking information for the purpose of “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

certain information in this report constitutes forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to current views and estimates of our outlook for fiscal 2018 other future economic circumstances industry conditions in domestic and international markets our performance and financial results eg debt levels return on invested capital valueadded product growth capital expenditures tax rates access to foreign markets and dividend policy these forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and experiences to differ materially from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements we wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date made we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

among the factors that may cause actual results and experiences to differ from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements are the following i fluctuations in the cost and availability of inputs and raw materials such as live cattle live swine feed grains including corn and soybean meal and energy ii market conditions for finished products including competition from other global and domestic food processors supply and pricing of competing products and alternative proteins and demand for alternative proteins iii outbreak of a livestock disease such as avian influenza ai or bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse which could have an adverse effect on livestock we own the availability of livestock we purchase consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to access certain domestic and foreign markets iv the integration of advancepierre foods holdings inc v the effectiveness of our financial fitness program vi the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system vii access to foreign markets together with foreign economic conditions including currency fluctuations importexport restrictions and foreign politics viii changes in availability and relative costs of labor and contract growers and our ability to maintain good relationships with employees labor unions contract growers and independent producers providing us livestock ix issues related to food safety including costs resulting from product recalls regulatory compliance and any related claims or litigation x changes in consumer preference and diets and our ability to identify and react to consumer trends xi effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs xii our ability to leverage brand value propositions xiii risks associated with leverage including cost increases due to rising interest rates or changes in debt ratings or outlook xiv impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets xv compliance with and changes to regulations and laws both domestic and foreign including changes in accounting standards tax laws environmental laws agricultural laws and occupational health and safety laws xvi adverse results from litigation xvii cyber incidents security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology systems xviii our ability to make effective acquisitions or joint ventures and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into existing operations xix risks associated with our commodity purchasing activities xx the effect of or changes in general economic conditions xxi significant marketing plan changes by large customers or loss of one or more large customers xxii impacts on our operations caused by factors and forces beyond our control such as natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemics or extreme weather xxiii failure to maximize or assert our intellectual property rights xxiv our participation in a multiemployer pension plan xxv the tyson limited partnership’s ability to exercise significant control over the company xxvi effects related to changes in tax rates valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax laws and their interpretation xxvii volatility in capital markets or interest rates and xxviii those factors listed under item 1a “risk factors” 




 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition as well as the selling prices for our products are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as beef pork poultry corn soybean packaging materials and energy and to a lesser extent cheese fruit seasoning blends flour corn syrup corn oils butter and sugar corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients for instance represented roughly 55  of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2017  production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control such factors include among other things weather patterns throughout the world outbreaks of disease the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability the company’s objective is to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time however we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors in addition if we increase prices to offset higher costs we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes conversely decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices while we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices 

over time if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program then commodity and raw material price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability financial condition and results of operations 

the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

the food industry in general is intensely competitive we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach some of the factors on which we compete include pricing product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of our products including distribution channels used such as ecommerce and competing products customer service and credit terms 

from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and promotions and new product innovation such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases could harm our profit margins if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer alternatively if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes our revenues and market share could be adversely affected 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and the supply and demand for our products 

supply of and demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or livestock owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

the integration of advancepierre may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the acquisition may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits including cost synergies 

the success of the acquisition of advancepierre including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate advancepierre’s businesses in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration failure to effectively integrate the businesses could adversely impact the expected benefits of the acquisition including cost synergies arising from supply chain efficiencies merchandising activities and overlapping general and administrative functions 

the integration of two large companies is complex and we will be required to devote significant management attention and incur substantial costs to integrate advancepierres and tyson’s business practices policies cultures and operations this diversion of our management’s attention from daytoday business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives could result in performance shortfalls which could adversely impact the combined company’s business operations and financial results the integration process could also result in the loss of key employees which could adversely impact the combined company’s future financial results 

furthermore during the integration planning process we may encounter additional challenges and difficulties including those related to without limitation managing a larger combined company streamlining supply chains consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating overlapping operations retaining our existing vendors and customers unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems and unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the acquisition of advancepierre delays encountered in the integration could adversely impact the business financial condition and operations of the combined company 

we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from the advancepierre acquisition and refine them our actual cost savings could differ materially from our current estimates actual cost savings the costs required to realize the cost savings and the source of the cost savings could differ materially from our estimates and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of cost savings on the schedule anticipated or at all or that these cost savings programs will not have other adverse effects on our business in light of these uncertainties you should not place undue reliance on our estimated cost savings 

finally we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or longterm strategic benefits of the advancepierre acquisition in a timely manner or at all or could incur higher transition costs than anticipated an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the advancepierre acquisition as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of our financial fitness program which may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 our board of directors approved a multiyear restructuring program the “financial fitness program” which is expected to contribute to the company’s overall strategy of financial fitness through increased operational effectiveness and overhead reduction for more information regarding this program refer to the heading “overview” set forth in part ii “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this report 

the success of the financial fitness program including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully implement the program in an efficient and effective manner the implementation of the financial fitness program may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the financial fitness program may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits if we are unable to implement the financial fitness program smoothly or successfully or we otherwise do not capture the anticipated savings our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted 

in addition we may incur higher costs associated with reductions in overhead than anticipated and the reduction in overhead could result in performance shortfalls the financial fitness program may become a distraction for our organization and may disrupt our ongoing business operations cause deterioration in employee morale disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations and result in negative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation if we are unable to successfully manage the negative consequences of the financial fitness program our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be adversely affected 

we may experience difficulties in implementing an enterprise resource planning system over the next few years 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of an enterprise resource planning “erp” system such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial management and personnel perspective the implementation of the erp system may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and there can be no assurance that this system will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations produce financial reports or otherwise operate our business as we implement our new erp system our exposure to system attacks may be elevated because we will be running old and new processes in parallel and must simultaneously protect both the new system and legacy systems if we are unable to implement the erp system smoothly or successfully or we otherwise do not capture anticipated benefits our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted additionally our implementation of the erp system may involve greater utilization of thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations problems faced by us or our thirdparty “cloud” computing providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition for future periods 

we are subject to risks associated with our international activities which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2017  we sold products to approximately 117  countries major sales markets include canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east south korea and taiwan our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2017  totaled 45 billion of which 39 billion  related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 217 million  of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily brazil china european union and india at the end of fiscal 2017  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 



 negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 122000  employees approximately 35000  of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

if we are unable to attract hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce it could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our continued growth requires us to attract hire retain and develop key employees including our executive officers and senior management team and maintain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to attract and hire highly skilled employees and our own employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies competition could cause us to lose talented employees and unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees 

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could adversely affect our financial results and damage our reputation 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the furtherprocessing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results in addition we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil become contaminated are tampered with or are mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers 

failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results 

our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences purchasing behaviors and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want in the channels where they shop we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify develop manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets such as adapting to emerging ecommerce channels our financial results and our competitive position will suffer in addition our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights which could negatively impact our results of operations 

we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments including advertising consumer promotions and trade spend due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising promotions and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices 

our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image 

we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image if we do not maintain or extend our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products especially during economic downturn may adversely affect our profitability 

in many product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows or if there is a perception of such a narrowing consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us in addition in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more lowerpriced private label or other economy brands to the extent this occurs we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition in times of economic uncertainty consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers which in turn reduces our product sales 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 



our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates ebitda multiples and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using an income approach the income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of september 30 2017  we had  134 billion  of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which represented approximately 48  of total assets 

new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products see “environmental regulation and food safety” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected for example increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices 

increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us we use natural gas diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures 

legal claims class action lawsuits other regulatory enforcement actions or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

we operate in a highlyregulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those contained in item 3 legal proceedings and part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies in this annual report on form 10k could subject us to civil and criminal penalties including debarment from governmental contracts that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results 

the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation proceedings and investigations 

our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment compliance with these laws and regulations and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations is material to our business new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation assessment or expenditures in addition some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and over time we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities andor waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses the occurrence of any of these events the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial results 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information technology systems against or effectively respond to cyberattacks other cyber incidents or security breaches or if our information technology systems are otherwise disrupted 

information technology is an important part of our business operations and we increasingly rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements in addition we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities personnel customers and suppliers like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses cyberattacks hackers unauthorized access attempts and other security issues attempted cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise 

we have implemented and continue to evaluate security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks but these measures may not be adequate any significant failure of our systems including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended or our failure to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents could cause transaction errors processing inefficiencies loss of customers and sales have negative consequences on our employees and our business partners have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation and expose us to liability litigation and regulatory enforcement actions in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our business partners customers consumers or suppliers finally the disclosure of nonpublic information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image similar risks exist with respect to the thirdparty vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions including health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions and systems managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions or divestitures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties including 

 we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

additionally from time to time we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability and margins moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability our divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems possible need for providing transition services to buyers adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations on april 24 2017 we announced our intent to sell three nonprotein businesses sara lee® frozen bakery kettle and van’s® which are all a part of our prepared foods segment as part of our strategic focus on proteinpacked brands we anticipate we will close the transactions by the end of calendar 2017 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

 the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for 173  of our sales in fiscal 2017  our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts and if they do sign contracts they generally are limited in scope and duration there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past alternative retail channels such as convenience stores dollar stores drug stores club stores and internetbased retailers   have increased their market share this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be adversely impacted many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to or adverse change to trade terms with a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages decrease in availability of water damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels or unfavorably impact the demand for or our consumers’ ability to purchase our products among other things any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our trade secrets patents and copyrights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions 

we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

participation in a multiemployer pension plan could adversely affect our business 

through our wholly owned subsidiary hillshire brands we participate in a “multiemployer” pension plan administered by a labor union representing some of its employees we are required to make periodic contributions to this plan to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to this fund could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to this fund inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plans funding of vested benefits the multiemployer plan in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal was to occur with respect to the multiemployer plan the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 

tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control 

as of september 30 2017  tyson limited partnership the tlp owns 99985  of the outstanding shares of the companys class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and the tlp and members of the tyson family own in the aggregate 207  of the outstanding shares of the companys class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them collectively control of approximately 7078  of the total voting power of the companys outstanding voting stock at this time the tlp does not have a managing general partner as such the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners as of september 30 2017  mr john tyson chairman of the board of directors has 3333 of the general partner percentage interests and ms barbara tyson a director of the company has 11115 general partner percentage interests the remaining general partnership interests are held by the donald j tyson revocable trust 4444 and harry c erwin iii 11115 as a result of these holdings positions and directorships the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tlps significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we are eligible for “controlled company” exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties which could adversely affect our financial results 

volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states the difference between plan obligations and assets which signifies the funded status of the plans is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements as of september 30 2017  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of  195 million  as compared to an underfunded position of  336 million  at the end of fiscal 2016  changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities the repurchases of senior notes repayment of term loans and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions

we expect to contribute approximately 38 million  of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2018 as compared to approximately 53 million  in fiscal 2017 and 64 million  in fiscal 2016 the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements as a result the actual funding in fiscal 2018 may be different from the estimate

refer to the discussion under part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of significant accounting policies and note 2 changes in accounting principles 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

  











impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

description  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary if it is determined based on qualitative factors the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macroeconomic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test 

in january 2017 the fasb issued updated guidance simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment the guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill we early adopted this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 however the adoption did not have an impact to our fiscal 2017 goodwill impairment assessment for further description of this new guidance refer to part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 2 changes in accounting principles 

for indefinite life intangible assets a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired similar to goodwill we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2017 impairment test 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

judgments and uncertainties  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of various valuation techniques including an income approach discounted cash flow analysis and market approaches ebitda multiples of comparable publiclytraded companies and precedent transactions our primary technique is discounted cash flow analysis these approaches use significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy and requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates 

we include assumptions about sales operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets business plans and economic projections and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units industries 

our prepared foods reporting unit which is our prepared foods operating segment had goodwill at september 30 2017 totaling 3678 million we generally assumed operating margins in future years would be in our normalized range of 10 to 12 as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year we would have failed the quantitative step of the annual impairment test which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss the current year prepared foods reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to unusual items in fiscal 2017 including 213 million of charges related to an acquisition impairment of our san diego operation impairment associated with the expected sale of a nonprotein business and restructuring and related charges additionally we are in the process of divesting three nonprotein businesses and integrating advancepierre’s prepared operations into the prepared foods reporting unit as well as executing our financial fitness program which should collectively improve operating results in future periods to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2017 the prepared foods reporting unit’s projected operating margins utilizing the discounted cash flow valuation technique had to average 66 breakeven we exceeded the breakeven operating margin level for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 as well as each of the previous two fiscal years and expect to well exceed it in fiscal 2018 and in future years 

the fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings valuation approaches which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years 

during fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the goodwill impairment analysis in fiscal 2015 we recorded a 23 million full impairment of an immaterial reporting unit’s goodwill 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates market ebitda comparables and credit ratings while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value it could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill 

all of our material reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of impairment 

the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to 67 in fiscal 2017 from 62 in fiscal 2016 discount rates continue to be low compared to historical levels a 54 increase in the discount rate would have caused the carrying value of our prepared foods reporting unit with 3678 million of goodwill at september 30 2017 to exceed its discounted cash flows fair value 

our fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge all indefinite life intangible assets’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material indefinite life intangible assets at significant risk of impairment 

the discount rate used in our annual indefinite life intangible assets impairment test was 79 in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 a 20 increase in the discount rate would have caused the carrying value of one intangible asset which has a carrying value of 533 million to exceed fair value 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk  we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 30 2017  and october 1 2016  on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis included hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 



interest rate risk  at september 30 2017  we had variable rate debt of 2756 million with a weighted average interest rate of 19  a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at september 30 2017  and october 1 2016  would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at september 30 2017  we had fixedrate debt of  7447 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 41  market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately  150 million  at september 30 2017  and 71 million at october 1 2016  the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

we have interest rate risk associated with our pension and postretirement benefit obligations changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pensions and other postretirement benefits for additional information 

foreign currency risk  we have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currencies we have exposure to are the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro the japanese yen and the mexican peso we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at september 30 2017  and october 1 2016  related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have a 7 million and 3 million impact respectively on pretax income 

concentrations of credit risk  our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at september 30 2017  and october 1 2016  186  and 189  respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart stores inc no other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

chicken  the primary raw materials used in our domestic chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants where they are slaughtered and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2016  corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 57  of our cost of growing a live chicken domestically in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

beef  the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities although we generally expect adequate supply of live cattle in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

pork  the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ hog buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the supply of live hogs is adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a small number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of market hogs and live swine for our own processing needs 

prepared foods  the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including chicken beef pork turkey corn flour vegetables and other cooking ingredients some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for chicken beef and certain prepared foods products such as hot dogs and smoked sausage generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and certain other prepared foods products such as prepared meals meat dishes appetizers frozen pies and breakfast sausage generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for 175  of our fiscal 2016  consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in all of our segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2016  consolidated sales

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing chicken beef pork turkey and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress the united states environmental protection agency and some states continue to consider various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time what options if any will be finalized and whether such options would have a direct impact on the company due to continuing uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our chicken beef pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the united states food and drug administration we are also participants in the united states hazard analysis critical control point program and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 additionally our foreign operations are subject to various other food safety and quality assurance oversight and review

 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the integration of the hillshire brands company may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the acquisition may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits including cost synergies  

the success of the acquisition of hillshire brands including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate hillshire brands’ businesses in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration failure to effectively integrate the businesses could adversely impact the expected benefits of the acquisition including cost synergies stemming from supply chain efficiencies merchandising activities and overlapping general and administrative functions 

the integration of two large companies is complex and we will be required to devote significant management attention and incur substantial costs to integrate hillshire brands’ and tyson’s business practices policies cultures and operations this diversion of our management’s attention from daytoday business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives could result in performance shortfalls which could adversely impact the combined company’s business operations and financial results the integration process could also result in the loss of key employees which could adversely impact the combined company’s future financial results 

furthermore during the integration planning process we may encounter additional challenges and difficulties including those related to without limitation managing a larger combined company streamlining supply chains consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating overlapping operations retaining our existing vendors and customers unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems and unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the acquisition of hillshire brands’ business delays encountered in the integration could adversely impact the business financial condition and operations of the combined company 

we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from the hillshire brands acquisition and refine them our actual cost savings could differ materially from our current estimates actual cost savings the costs required to realize the cost savings and the source of the cost savings could differ materially from our estimates and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of cost savings on the schedule anticipated or at all or that these cost savings programs will not have other adverse effects on our business in light of these uncertainties you should not place undue reliance on our estimated cost savings 

finally we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or longterm strategic benefits of the hillshire brands acquisition or could incur higher transition costs an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the hillshire brands acquisition as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition as well as the selling prices for our products are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as pork beef poultry corn soybean packaging materials and energy and to a lesser extent cheese fruit seasoning blends flour corn syrup corn oils butter and sugar corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients for instance represented roughly 57  of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2016  production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control such factors include among other things weather patterns throughout the world outbreaks of disease the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability the company’s objective is to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time however we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors in addition if we increase prices to offset higher costs we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes conversely decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices while we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices 

over time if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program then commodity and raw material price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability financial condition and results of operations 

the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

the food industry in general is intensely competitive we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach some of the factors on which we compete include pricing product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of our products and competing products customer service and credit terms 

from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and promotions and new product innovation such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases could harm our profit margins if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer alternatively if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes our revenues and market share would be adversely affected 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 

demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or livestock owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

we are subject to risks associated with our international activities which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2016  we sold products to approximately 115  countries major sales markets include canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east south korea and taiwan our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2016  totaled 41 billion of which 35 billion  related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 204 million  of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily brazil china and india at the end of fiscal 2016  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 114000  employees approximately 33000  of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

if we are unable to attract hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce it could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our continued growth requires us to attract hire retain and develop key employees including our executive officers and senior management team and maintain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to attract and hire highly skilled employees and our own employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies competition could cause us to lose talented employees and unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees 

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the furtherprocessing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil become contaminated are tampered with or are mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers 

failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results 

our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify develop manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets our financial results and our competitive position will suffer in addition our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights which could negatively impact our results of operations 

we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments including advertising consumer promotions and trade spend due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising promotions and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices 

our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image 

we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image if we do not maintain or extend our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products especially during economic downturn may adversely affect our profitability 

in many product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows or if there is a perception of such a narrowing consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us in addition in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more lowerpriced private label or other economy brands to the extent this occurs we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition in times of economic uncertainty consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers which in turn reduces our product sales 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of october 1 2016  we had  107 billion  of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which represented approximately 48  of total assets 

new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products see “environmental regulation and food safety” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected for example increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices 

increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us we use natural gas diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures 

legal claims class action lawsuits other regulatory enforcement actions or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations including those contained in item 3 legal proceedings and part ii item 8 and notes to consolidated financial statements note 19 commitments and contingencies in this annual report on form 10k could subject us to civil and criminal penalties including debarment from governmental contracts that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results 

the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation proceedings and investigations 

our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment compliance with these laws and regulations and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations is material to our business new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation assessment or expenditures in addition some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and over time we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities andor waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses the occurrence of any of these events the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial results 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information technology systems against or effectively respond to cyberattacks other cyber incidents or security breaches or if our information technology systems are otherwise disrupted 

information technology is an important part of our business operations and we increasingly rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements in addition we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities personnel customers and suppliers like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses cyberattacks hackers unauthorized access attempts and other security issues attempted cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise 

we have implemented and continue to evaluate security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks but these measures may not be adequate any significant failure of our systems including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended or our failure to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents could cause transaction errors processing inefficiencies loss of customers and sales have negative consequences on our employees and our business partners have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation and expose us to liability litigation and regulatory enforcement actions in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our business partners customers consumers or suppliers finally the disclosure of nonpublic information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image similar risks exist with respect to the thirdparty vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions including health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions and systems managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions or divestitures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties including 

 we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

 the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for 175  of our sales in fiscal 2016  our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts and if they do sign contracts they generally are limited in scope and duration there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to or adverse change to trade terms with a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages decrease in availability of water damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our trade secrets patents and copyrights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions 

we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control 

as of october 1 2016  tyson limited partnership the tlp owns 99985  of the outstanding shares of the companys class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and the tlp and members of the tyson family own in the aggregate 206  of the outstanding shares of the companys class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them collectively control of approximately 7118  of the total voting power of the companys outstanding voting stock at this time the tlp does not have a managing general partner as such the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners as of october 1 2016  mr john tyson chairman of the board of directors has 3333  of the general partner percentage interests and ms barbara tyson a director of the company has 11115  general partner percentage interests the remaining general partnership interests are held by the tyson partnership interest trust  4444  and harry c erwin iii  11115  as a result of these holdings positions and directorships the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tlps significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we are eligible for “controlled company” exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties which could adversely affect our financial results 

we could incur substantial tax liabilities as a result of the demb master blenders 1753 nv “demb” spinoff 

on june 28 2012 hillshire brands divested its international coffee and tea business segment through the spinoff of demb the “spinoff” hillshire brands intended for the spinoff and certain related transactions to qualify as taxfree under sections 355 368a1d and 361 and related provisions of the united states internal revenue code which we refer to as the code and hillshire brands received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the spinoff and certain related transactions including a debt exchange will qualify as taxfree to hillshire brands and its stockholders for united states federal income tax purposes although a private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs if the factual representations or assumptions made in the private letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any material forwardlooking covenants or undertakings are not complied with then hillshire brands would not be able to rely on the ruling in addition the ruling is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if the applicable law changes with retroactive effect as a matter of practice the irs does not rule on every requirement for a taxfree spinoff or taxfree debtfordebt exchange and the parties relied solely on the opinion of counsel for comfort that such additional requirements should be satisfied the opinion of counsel relies on among other things the continuing validity of the ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by hillshire brands and demb which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion 

the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail accordingly even though hillshire brands obtained a ruling and a “should” opinion of counsel the irs could assert that hillshire brands has not satisfied the requirements for taxfree treatment and such assertion if successful could result in significant united states federal income tax liabilities for us 

events subsequent to the spinoff could cause the spinoff to become taxable under the terms of the tax sharing agreement hillshire brands entered into with demb in connection with the spinoff demb will generally be required to indemnify hillshire brands for 100 of any taxes imposed on demb and its subsidiaries or hillshire brands and its subsidiaries in the event that the spinoff and certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment as a result of an acquisition of demb including the acquisition of demb by ja benckiser or actions or omissions including breaches of certain representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement by demb or any of its affiliates however if the spinoff or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment because of actions or omissions by hillshire brands or any of its affiliates hillshire brands would be responsible for all such taxes in addition hillshire brands would be responsible for 50 of any taxes resulting from the failure of the spinoff and certain related transactions to qualify as taxfree which failure is not due to actions or omissions including breaches of certain representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement by hillshire brands demb or any of hillshire brands’ or dembs respective subsidiaries there can be no assurance that the tax sharing agreement will be sufficient to protect hillshire brands against any tax liabilities that may arise or that demb will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations hillshire brands’ inability to enforce the indemnification provisions of the tax sharing agreement or obtain indemnification payments in a timely manner could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

participation in a multiemployer pension plan could adversely affect our business 

through our wholly owned subsidiary hillshire brands we participate in a “multiemployer” pension plan administered by a labor union representing some of its employees we are required to make periodic contributions to this plan to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to this fund could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to this fund inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plans funding of vested benefits the multiemployer plan in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal was to occur with respect to the multiemployer plan the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 

volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states the difference between plan obligations and assets which signifies the funded status of the plans is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements as of october 1 2016  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of  336 million  as compared to an underfunded position of  410 million  at the end of fiscal 2015  changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities the repurchases of senior notes repayment of term loans and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions 



 

 



 



capital resources 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed capacity of 125 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs letters of credit and a source of financing for growth opportunities as of october 1 2016  we had 300 million borrowed and 7 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility none of which were drawn upon which left 943 million available for borrowing our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 42 banks with commitments ranging from 03 million to 85 million per bank the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements 

capitalization 

to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our longterm financing decisions at october 1 2016  and october 3 2015  the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 17x and 21x respectively refer to part ii item 6 selected financial data for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures the decrease in this ratio for fiscal 2016 is primarily due to increased ebitda of 632 million

debt covenants 

our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debttocapitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october 1 2016  

pension plans 

as further described in part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 14 pensions and other postretirement benefits the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of  336 million  at the end of fiscal 2016 as compared to an underfunded position of  410 million  at the end of fiscal 2015 

we expect to contribute approximately 40 million  of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2017 as compared to approximately 64 million  in fiscal 2016 and 14 million  in fiscal 2015 the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements as a result the actual funding in fiscal 2017 may be different from the estimate 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties including leases and grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 19 commitments and contingencies for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 1 2016  

  

 in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 283 million and related interest and penalties of 52 million  at october 1 2016  recorded as liabilities 

the maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at october 1 2016  based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 380 million  or approximately 378 million remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash flow assistance related receivables 

recently issuedadopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to the discussion under part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of significant accounting policies and note 2 changes in accounting principles 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

  









impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

description  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary if it is determined based on qualitative factors the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than carrying amount or if significant changes to macroeconomic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a twostep process the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the quantitative impairment test is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize if any 

the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount then goodwill is not considered impaired however if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination ie the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay for the same business 

for indefinite life intangible assets a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired similar to goodwill we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we elected to forgo the qualitative assessments on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2016 impairment test 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

judgments and uncertainties  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using various valuation techniques with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates 

we include assumptions about sales operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets business plans and economic projections and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units industries 

the fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings valuation approaches which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years 

during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis and therefore the second step was not necessary in fiscal 2015 we recorded a 23 million full impairment of an immaterial reporting unit’s goodwill 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates and credit ratings while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value we may be required to perform the second step which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill 

all of our material reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test 

the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test decreased to 62 in fiscal 2016 from 68 in fiscal 2015 discount rates continue to be low compared to historical levels a 38 increase in the discount rate would have caused our prepared foods reporting unit with 4005 million of goodwill at october 1 2016 to fail the first step of the goodwill impairment step and may have resulted in a material impairment upon completion of the second step 

we did not have material indefinite life intangible assets prior to the acquisition of hillshire brands in august 2014 our fiscal 2016 and 2015 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analyses did not result in an impairment charge all indefinite life intangible assets’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material indefinite life intangible assets at significant risk of impairment 

the discount rate used in our annual indefinite life intangible assets impairment test was 79 in fiscal 2016 and 80 in fiscal 2015 a 20 increase in the discount rate would have caused the carrying value of two intangible assets which have a combined carrying value of 2476 million to exceed fair value 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk  we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of october 1 2016  and october 3 2015  on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis included hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 



interest rate risk  at october 1 2016  we had variable rate debt of  1357 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 18  a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at october 1 2016  and october 3 2015  would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at october 1 2016  we had fixedrate debt of 4922 million with a weighted average interest rate of 43  market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately  71 million  at october 1 2016  and 87 million at october 3 2015  the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

we have interest rate risk associated with our pension and postretirement benefit obligations changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 14 pensions and other postretirement benefits for additional information 

foreign currency risk  we have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currencies we have exposure to are the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro the japanese yen and the mexican peso we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at october 1 2016  and october 3 2015  related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have a 3 million impact on pretax income 

concentrations of credit risk  our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at october 1 2016  and october 3 2015  189  and 200  respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart stores inc no other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

chicken  the primary raw materials used in our domestic chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants where they are slaughtered and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate our own feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2015  corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 64  of our cost of growing a live chicken domestically in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase live icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

beef  the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities although we generally expect adequate supply of live cattle in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

pork  the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ hog buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the supply of live hogs is adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a small number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of market hogs and live swine for our own processing needs 

prepared foods  the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including chicken beef pork turkey corn flour vegetables and other cooking ingredients some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for chicken beef and certain prepared foods products such as hot dogs and smoked sausage generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and certain other prepared foods products such as prepared meals meat dishes appetizers frozen pies and breakfast sausage generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for 168  of our fiscal 2015  consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in all of our segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2015  consolidated sales 

competition 

our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers additionally our food products compete in markets around the world 

we seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy which includes 

 past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy as supported by our distribution systems the principal competitive elements are price product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of products customer service and credit terms

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing chicken beef pork turkey and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress the united states environmental protection agency and some states continue to consider various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time what options if any will be finalized and whether such options would have a direct impact on the company due to continuing uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our chicken beef pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the united states department of agriculture usda and the united states food and drug administration fda we are also participants in the united states hazard analysis critical control point haccp program and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 additionally our foreign operations are subject to various other food safety and quality assurance oversight and review

 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the integration of the hillshire brands company may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the acquisition may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits including cost synergies  

the success of the acquisition of hillshire brands including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate hillshire brands’ businesses in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration failure to effectively integrate the businesses could adversely impact the expected benefits of the acquisition including cost synergies stemming from supply chain efficiencies merchandising activities and overlapping general and administrative functions 

the integration of two large companies is complex and we will be required to devote significant management attention and incur substantial costs to integrate hillshire brands’ and tyson’s business practices policies cultures and operations this diversion of our management’s attention from daytoday business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives could result in performance shortfalls which could adversely impact the combined company’s business operations and financial results the integration process could also result in the loss of key employees which could adversely impact the combined company’s future financial results 

furthermore during the integration planning process we may encounter additional challenges and difficulties including those related to without limitation managing a larger combined company streamlining supply chains consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating overlapping operations retaining our existing vendors and customers unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems and unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the acquisition of hillshire brands’ business delays encountered in the integration could adversely impact the business financial condition and operations of the combined company 

we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from the hillshire brands acquisition and refine them our actual costsavings could differ materially from our current estimates actual costsavings the costs required to realize the costsavings and the source of the costsavings could differ materially from our estimates and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of costsavings on the schedule anticipated or at all or that these costsavings programs will not have other adverse effects on our business in light of these uncertainties you should not place undue reliance on our estimated costsavings 

finally we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or longterm strategic benefits of the hillshire brands acquisition or could incur higher transition costs an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the hillshire brands acquisition as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition as well as the selling prices for our products are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as pork beef poultry corn soybean packaging materials and energy and to a lesser extent cheese fruit seasoning blends flour corn syrup corn oils butter and sugar corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients for instance represented roughly 64  of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2015  production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control such factors include among other things weather patterns throughout the world outbreaks of disease the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability the company’s objective is to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time however we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors in addition if we increase prices to offset higher costs we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes conversely decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices while we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices 

over time if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program then commodity and raw material price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability financial condition and results of operations 

the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

the food industry in general is intensely competitive we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach some of the factors on which we compete include pricing product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of our products and competing products customer service and credit terms 

from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and promotions and new product innovation such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases could harm our profit margins if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer alternatively if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes our revenues and market share would be adversely affected 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 

demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

we are subject to risks associated with our international activities which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2015  we sold products to approximately 130  countries major sales markets include brazil canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east south korea and taiwan our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2015  totaled 52 billion of which 41 billion  related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 191 million  of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily brazil china and india at the end of fiscal 2015  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 113000  employees approximately 36000  of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the furtherprocessing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil become contaminated are tampered with or are mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers 

failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results 

our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify develop manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets our financial results and our competitive position will suffer in addition our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights which could negatively impact our results of operations 

we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments including advertising consumer promotions and trade spend due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising promotions and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices 

our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image 

we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image if we do not maintain or extend our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products especially during economic downturn may adversely affect our profitability 

in many product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows or if there is a perception of such a narrowing consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us in addition in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more lowerpriced private label or other economy brands to the extent this occurs we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition in times of economic uncertainty consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers which in turn reduces our product sales 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of october 3 2015  we had  107 billion  of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which represented approximately 47  of total assets 

new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products see “environmental regulation and food safety” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected for example increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices 

increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us we use natural gas diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures 

legal claims other regulatory enforcement actions or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results 

the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation proceedings and investigations 

our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment compliance with these laws and regulations and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations is material to our business new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation assessment or expenditures in addition some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and over time we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities andor waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses the occurrence of any of these events the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial results 

failures or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

information technology is an important part of our business operations and we increasingly rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements in addition we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities personnel customers and suppliers like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions including during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses cyberattacks hackers unauthorized access attempts and other security issues we have implemented technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks but these measures may not be adequate any significant failure of our systems including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended could cause transaction errors processing inefficiencies loss of customers and sales have negative consequences on our employees and our business partners and have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers consumers or suppliers in addition the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions or divestitures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties including 

 we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

 the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for 168  of our sales in fiscal 2015  our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts and if they do sign contracts they generally are limited in scope and duration there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to or adverse change to trade terms with a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our trade secrets patents and copyrights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions 

we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control 

as of october 3 2015  tyson limited partnership the tlp owns 99985  of the outstanding shares of the companys class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and the tlp and members of the tyson family own in the aggregate 179  of the outstanding shares of the companys class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them collectively control of approximately 7064  of the total voting power of the companys outstanding voting stock at this time the tlp does not have a managing general partner as such the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners as of october 3 2015  mr john tyson chairman of the board of directors has 3333  of the general partner percentage interests and ms barbara tyson a director of the company has 11115  general partner percentage interests the remaining general partnership interests are held by the tyson partnership interest trust  4444  and harry c erwin iii  11115  as a result of these holdings positions and directorships the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tlps significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we are eligible for “controlled company” exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties which could adversely affect our financial results 

we could incur substantial tax liabilities as a result of the demb master blenders 1753 nv “demb” spinoff 

on june 28 2012 hillshire brands divested its international coffee and tea business segment through the spinoff of demb the “spinoff” hillshire brands intended for the spinoff and certain related transactions to qualify as taxfree under sections 355 368a1d and 361 and related provisions of the united states internal revenue code which we refer to as the code and hillshire brands received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the spinoff and certain related transactions including a debt exchange will qualify as taxfree to hillshire brands and its stockholders for united states federal income tax purposes although a private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs if the factual representations or assumptions made in the private letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any material forwardlooking covenants or undertakings are not complied with then hillshire brands would not be able to rely on the ruling in addition the ruling is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if the applicable law changes with retroactive effect as a matter of practice the irs does not rule on every requirement for a taxfree spinoff or taxfree debtfordebt exchange and the parties relied solely on the opinion of counsel for comfort that such additional requirements should be satisfied the opinion of counsel relies on among other things the continuing validity of the ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by hillshire brands and demb which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail accordingly even though hillshire brands obtained a ruling and a “should” opinion of counsel the irs could assert that hillshire brands has not satisfied the requirements for taxfree treatment and such assertion if successful could result in significant united states federal income tax liabilities for us 

events subsequent to the spinoff could cause the spinoff to become taxable under the terms of the tax sharing agreement hillshire brands entered into with demb in connection with the spinoff demb will generally be required to indemnify hillshire brands for 100 of any taxes imposed on demb and its subsidiaries or hillshire brands and its subsidiaries in the event that the spinoff and certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment as a result of an acquisition of demb including the acquisition of demb by ja benckiser or actions or omissions including breaches of certain representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement by demb or any of its affiliates however if the spinoff or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment because of actions or omissions by hillshire brands or any of its affiliates hillshire brands would be responsible for all such taxes in addition hillshire brands would be responsible for 50 of any taxes resulting from the failure of the spinoff and certain related transactions to qualify as taxfree which failure is not due to actions or omissions including breaches of certain representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement by hillshire brands demb or any of hillshire brands’ or dembs respective subsidiaries there can be no assurance that the tax sharing agreement will be sufficient to protect hillshire brands against any tax liabilities that may arise or that demb will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations hillshire brands’ inability to enforce the indemnification provisions of the tax sharing agreement or obtain indemnification payments in a timely manner could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

participation in a multiemployer pension plan could adversely affect our business 

through our wholly owned subsidiary hillshire brands we participate in a “multiemployer” pension plan administered by a labor union representing some of its employees we are required to make periodic contributions to this plan to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to this fund could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to this fund inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plans funding of vested benefits the multiemployer plan in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal was to occur with respect to the multiemployer plan the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 

volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states the difference between plan obligations and assets which signifies the funded status of the plans is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements as of october 3 2015 the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of  410 million  as compared to an underfunded position of  381 million  at the end of fiscal 2014 changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities the repurchases of senior notes repayment of term loans and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions

capital resources 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed capacity of 125 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs letters of credit and a source of financing for growth opportunities as of october 3 2015  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 6 million issued under this facility none of which were drawn upon which left 1244 million available for borrowing our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 42 banks with commitments ranging from 03 million to 85 million per bank the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements 

capitalization 

to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our longterm financing decisions at october 3 2015  and september 27 2014  the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 21x and 41x respectively refer to part ii item 6 selected financial data for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures the decrease in this ratio for fiscal 2015 is due to increased ebitda and the approximate 17 billion net debt reduction during fiscal 2015 

credit ratings 

2016 notes 

on february 11 2013 standard  poors ratings services sp upgraded the credit rating of the 2016 notes from bbb to bbb this upgrade did not impact the interest rate on the 2016 notes 

on june 7 2012 moodys investors service inc moodys upgraded the credit rating of the 2016 notes from ba1 to baa3 this upgrade decreased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 685 to 660 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due october 1 2012 

a onenotch downgrade by moodys would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 025 a twonotch downgrade from sp would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 025 

revolving credit facility 

sp’s corporate credit rating for tyson foods inc is bbb moody’s senior unsecured subsidiary guaranteed longterm debt rating for tyson foods inc is baa3 fitch ratings fitch issuer default rating for tyson foods inc is bbb the below table outlines the fees paid on the unused portion of the facility facility fee rate and letter of credit fees undrawn letter of credit fee and borrowing spread depending on the rating levels of tyson foods inc from sp moodys and fitch 



in the event the rating levels are split the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level in effect for two of the rating agencies or if all three rating agencies have different rating levels the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level that is between the rating levels of the other two rating agencies 

debt covenants 

our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debttocapitalization ratios 

our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october 3 2015  

pension plans 

as further described in part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pension and other postretirement benefits the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of  410 million  at the end of fiscal 2015 as compared to an underfunded position of  381 million  at the end of fiscal 2014 

we expect to contribute approximately 63 million  of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately 14 million  in fiscal 2015 and 9 million  in fiscal 2014 the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements as a result the actual funding in fiscal 2016 may be different from the estimate 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties including leases and grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 3 2015  

  

 in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 284 million and related interest and penalties of 46 million  at october 3 2015  recorded as liabilities 

the maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at october 3 2015  based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 310 million  there were no receivables under these programs at october 3 2015

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

  









impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

description  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary if it is determined based on qualitative factors the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than carrying amount or if significant changes to macroeconomic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a twostep process the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the quantitative impairment test is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize if any 

the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount then goodwill is not considered impaired however if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination ie the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay for the same business 

for indefinite life intangible assets a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired similar to goodwill we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we elected to forgo the qualitative assessments on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2015 impairment test 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

judgments and uncertainties  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using various valuation techniques with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates 

we include assumptions about sales operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets business plans and economic projections and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units industries for the fiscal 2015 impairment test of material reporting units our beef and prepared foods reporting units utilized operating margins in future years in excess of the operating margin realized in the most recent year 

our beef reporting unit which is our beef operating segment had goodwill at october 3 2015 totaling 676 million we generally assumed operating margins in future years would be in our normalized range of 15 to 3 as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year we would have failed the first step of the annual impairment test which would have required the second step to be performed and may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss the current year beef reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to unusual items in fiscal 2015 including unfavorable market conditions associated with a temporary decline in supply which drove up live cattle prices export market disruptions and losses from marktomarket open derivative positions and lowerofcostormarket inventory adjustments due to a large and rapid decline in live cattle futures in september of fiscal 2015 to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2015 the beef reporting unit’s projected operating margins had to average 12 breakeven although the beef reporting unit’s actual performance in fiscal 2015 was below this amount it has performed above the 12 breakeven operating margin level in each of the previous six years and is expected to perform at or above this level in fiscal 2016 valuing the beef reporting unit utilizing projected operating margins averaging less than 12 breakeven or a 62 increase in the discount rate used in fiscal 2015 would have caused the carrying value of the beef reporting unit to be in excess of fair value which would have required the second step to be performed 

our prepared foods reporting unit which is our prepared foods operating segment had goodwill at october 3 2015 totaling 4005 million we generally assumed operating margins in future years would be in our expected range of 10 to 12 as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year we would have failed the first step of the annual impairment test which would have required the second step to be performed and may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss the current year prepared foods reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction as we are still integrating hillshire brands into the reporting unit including capturing the full benefit of the expected synergies as we proceed with the integration of hillshire brands we realized synergies of 322 million in fiscal 2015 and expect to realize more than 500 million in fiscal 2016 and 700 million in fiscal 2017 of which the majority of these benefits will be realized in the prepared foods segment to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2015 the prepared foods reporting unit’s projected operating margins had to average 77 breakeven we exceeded the breakeven operating margin level for the second half of fiscal 2015 and expect to exceed it in fiscal 2016 

the fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings valuation approaches which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years 

during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis and therefore the second step was not necessary in fiscal 2015 we recorded a 23 million full impairment of an immaterial reporting unit’s goodwill 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates and credit ratings while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value we may be required to perform the second step which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill 

all of our material reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test 

the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test decreased to 68 in fiscal 2015 from 79 in fiscal 2014 discount rates continue to be low compared to historical levels a 35 increase in the discount rate would have caused our prepared foods reporting unit with 4005 million of goodwill at october 3 2015 to fail the first step of the goodwill impairment step and may have resulted in a material impairment upon completion of the second step 

we did not have material indefinite life intangible assets prior to the acquisition of hillshire brands in august 2014 our fiscal 2015 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge a 35 decrease in the fair value of an indefinite life intangible with a carrying value of 301 million and a 165 decrease in the fair value of an indefinite life intangible with a carrying value of 2175 million would have caused their carrying value to exceed fair value all other indefinite life intangible assets’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 

the discount rate used in our annual indefinite life intangible assets impairment test was 80 in fiscal 2015 a 20 increase in the discount rate would have caused the carrying value of three intangible assets which have a combined carrying value of 3008 million to exceed fair value 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk  we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of october 3 2015  and september 27 2014  on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis included hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 



interest rate risk  at october 3 2015  we had variable rate debt of  1057 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 15  a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at october 3 2015  and september 27 2014  would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at october 3 2015  we had fixedrate debt of  5668 million  with a weighted average interest rate of 44  market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately  87 million  at october 3 2015  and 109 million at september 27 2014  the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

we have interest rate risk associated with our pension and postretirement benefit obligations changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pensions and other postretirement benefits for additional information 

foreign currency risk  we have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currencies we have exposure to are the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro the japanese yen and the mexican peso we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at october 3 2015  and september 27 2014  related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have a 3 million and 9 million impact respectively on pretax income 

concentrations of credit risk  our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at october 3 2015  and september 27 2014  200  and 186  respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart stores inc no other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

chicken  the primary raw materials used in our domestic chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants where they are slaughtered and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate our own feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2014  corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 68  of our cost of growing a live chicken domestically in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase live icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

beef  the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities although we generally expect adequate supply of live cattle in the regions we operate there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand 

pork  the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ hog buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the supply of live hogs is adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a small number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of market hogs and live swine for our own processing needs 

prepared foods  the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including chicken beef pork turkey corn flour vegetables and other cooking ingredients some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

international  the primary raw materials used in our international chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers and companyowned farms pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to independent and companyowned hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers or employees care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants where they are slaughtered and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate our own feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds and procure outside feed at times to meet our production needs in fiscal 2014 corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing approximately twothirds of our cost of growing a live chicken in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future we also purchase live icepacked or fresh chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

seasonal demand 

demand for chicken beef and certain prepared foods products such as hot dogs and smoked sausage generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and certain other prepared foods products such as prepared meals meat dishes appetizers frozen pies and breakfast sausage generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for 146  of our fiscal 2014  consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in all of our segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2014  consolidated sales 

competition 

our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers additionally our food products compete in markets around the world 

we seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy which includes 

 past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy as supported by our distribution systems the principal competitive elements are price product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of products customer service and credit terms 

foreign operations 

we sold products in approximately 130  countries in fiscal 2014  major sales markets include brazil canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east south korea taiwan and vietnam 

we have the following foreign operations 

 we continue to evaluate growth opportunities in foreign countries additional information regarding export sales longlived assets located in foreign countries and income loss from foreign operations is set forth in part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 17 segment reporting and note 9 income taxes 

research and development

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing chicken beef pork turkey and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress and the united states environmental protection agency are considering various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time when or if such options will be finalized or what the final form may be due to the uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our chicken beef pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the united states department of agriculture usda and the united states food and drug administration fda we are also participants in the united states hazard analysis critical control point haccp program and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 additionally our international operation is subject to various other food safety and quality assurance oversight and review

our principal marketing objective is to be the primary provider of chicken beef pork and prepared foods products for our customers and consumers we build the tyson® jimmy dean® hillshire farm® sara lee® frozen bakery ball park® wright® aidells® and state fair® brands while supporting strong regional and emerging brands primarily through welldefined productspecific advertising marketing and public relations efforts focused toward key consumer targets with specific needs we identify distinct markets and business opportunities through continuous consumer and market research these efforts are designed to present key products as everyday solutions to relevant consumer problems thereby becoming part of regular eating routines we utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products 

we have the ability to produce and ship fresh frozen and refrigerated products worldwide domestically our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our owned or leased cold storage warehouses public cold storage facilities and our transportation system our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate partialtruckload orders into full truckloads thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service in addition we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental united states internationally we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations 

patents and trademarks 

we have filed a number of patents and trademarks relating to our processes and products that either have been approved or are in the process of application because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our products we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts we also have developed nonpublic proprietary information regarding our production processes and other productrelated matters we utilize internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information and where appropriate seek patent andor trademark protection for the technology we utilize 

industry practices 

our agreements with customers are generally shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practices and fluctuations in supply demand and price for such products in certain instances where we are selling further processed products to large customers we may enter into written agreements whereby we will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer with pricing terms that are either fixed or variable

cautionary statements relevant to forwardlooking information for the purpose of “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

certain information in this report constitutes forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to current views and estimates of our outlook for fiscal 2015 other future economic circumstances industry conditions in domestic and international markets our performance and financial results eg debt levels return on invested capital valueadded product growth capital expenditures tax rates access to foreign markets and dividend policy these forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and experiences to differ materially from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements we wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date made we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the integration of the hillshire brands company may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the acquisition may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits including cost synergies  

the success of the acquisition of hillshire brands including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate hillshire brands’ businesses in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration failure to effectively integrate the businesses could adversely impact the expected benefits of the acquisition including cost synergies stemming from supply chain efficiencies merchandising activities and overlapping general and administrative functions 

the integration of two large companies is complex and we will be required to devote significant management attention and incur substantial costs to integrate hillshire brands’ and tyson’s business practices policies cultures and operations this diversion of our management’s attention from daytoday business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives could result in performance shortfalls which could adversely impact the combined company’s business operations and financial results the integration process could also result in the loss of key employees which could adversely impact the combined company’s future financial results 

furthermore during the integration planning process we may encounter additional challenges and difficulties including those related to without limitation managing a larger combined company streamlining supply chains consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating overlapping operations retaining our existing vendors and customers unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems and unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the acquisition of hillshire brands’ business delays encountered in the integration could adversely impact the business financial condition and operations of the combined company 

we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from the hillshire brands acquisition and refine them so that our actual costsavings could differ materially from our current estimates actual costsavings the costs required to realize the costsavings and the source of the costsavings could differ materially from our estimates and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of costsavings on the schedule anticipated or at all or that these costsavings programs will not have other adverse effects on our business in light of these uncertainties you should not place undue reliance on our estimated costsavings 

finally we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or longterm strategic benefits of the hillshire brands acquisition or could incur higher transition costs an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the hillshire brands acquisition as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition as well as the selling prices for our products are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as pork beef poultry corn soybean packaging materials and energy and to a lesser extent cheese fruit seasoning blends flour corn syrup corn oils butter and sugar corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients for instance represented roughly 68  of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2014  production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control such factors include among other things weather patterns throughout the world outbreaks of disease the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability the company’s objective is to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time however we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors in addition if we increase prices to offset higher costs we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes conversely decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices while we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices 

over time if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program then commodity and raw material price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability financial condition and results of operations 

the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

the food industry in general is intensely competitive we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach some of the factors on which we compete include pricing product safety and quality brand identification innovation breadth and depth of product offerings availability of our products and competing products customer service and credit terms 

from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and promotions and new product innovation such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases could harm our profit margins if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer alternatively if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes our revenues and market share would be adversely affected 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 

demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

we are subject to risks associated with our international activities which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2014  we sold products to approximately 130  countries major sales markets include brazil canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east south korea taiwan and vietnam our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2014  totaled 63 billion of which 47 billion  related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 324 million  of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily brazil china and india at the end of fiscal 2014  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 124000  employees approximately 42000  of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment therefore there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further processing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil become contaminated are tampered with or are mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers 

failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results 

our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify develop manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets our financial results and our competitive position will suffer in addition our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights which could negatively impact our results of operations 

we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments including advertising consumer promotions and trade spend due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising promotions and new product introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices 

our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared 

we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain or extend our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products especially during economic downturn may adversely affect our profitability 

in many product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows or if there is a perception of such a narrowing consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us in addition in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more lowerpriced private label or other economy brands to the extent this occurs we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition in times of economic uncertainty consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers which in turn reduces our product sales 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our senior notes and term loans also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relieffromroyalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under these valuation approaches we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of september 27 2014  we had  108 billion  of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which represented approximately 45  of total assets 

new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products see “environmental regulation and food safety” in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected for example increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices 

increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us we use natural gas diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures 

legal claims other regulatory enforcement actions or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results 

the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation proceedings and investigations 

our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment compliance with these laws and regulations and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations is material to our business new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation assessment or expenditures in addition some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and over time we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities andor waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses the occurrence of any of these events the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial results 

failures or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

information technology is an important part of our business operations and we increasingly rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements in addition we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities personnel customers and suppliers like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions including during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses cyberattacks hackers unauthorized access attempts and other security issues we have implemented technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks but these measures may not be adequate any significant failure of our systems including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended could cause transaction errors processing inefficiencies loss of customers and sales have negative consequences on our employees and our business partners and have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers consumers or suppliers in addition the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions or divestitures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties including 

 we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

 the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for 146  of our sales in fiscal 2014  our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts and if they do sign contracts they generally are limited in scope and duration there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past many of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to or adverse change to trade terms with a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our trade secrets patents and copyrights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control 

as of september 27 2014  tyson limited partnership the tlp owns 99985  of the outstanding shares of the companys class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and the tlp and members of the tyson family own in the aggregate 178  of the outstanding shares of the companys class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them collectively control of approximately 7014  of the total voting power of the companys outstanding voting stock at this time the tlp does not have a managing general partner as such the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners as of september 27 2014  mr john tyson chairman of the board of directors has 3333  of the general partner percentage interests and ms barbara tyson a director of the company has 11115  general partner percentage interests the remaining general partnership interests are held by the tyson partnership interest trust  4444  and harry c erwin iii  11115  as a result of these holdings positions and directorships the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tlps significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we are eligible for “controlled company” exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange 

we could incur substantial tax liabilities as a result of the demb master blenders 1753 nv “demb” spinoff 

on june 28 2012 hillshire brands divested its international coffee and tea business segment through the spinoff of demb the “spinoff” hillshire brands intended for the spinoff and certain related transactions to qualify as taxfree under sections 355 368a1d and 361 and related provisions of the us internal revenue code which we refer to as the code and hillshire brands received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the spinoff and certain related transactions including the debt exchange will qualify as taxfree to hillshire brands and its stockholders for us federal income tax purposes although a private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs if the factual representations or assumptions made in the private letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect or any material forwardlooking covenants or undertakings are not complied with then hillshire brands would not be able to rely on the ruling in addition the ruling is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if the applicable law changes with retroactive effect as a matter of practice the irs does not rule on every requirement for a taxfree spinoff or taxfree debtfordebt exchange and the parties relied solely on the opinion of counsel for comfort that such additional requirements should be satisfied the opinion of counsel relies on among other things the continuing validity of the ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by hillshire brands and demb which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail accordingly even though hillshire brands obtained a ruling and a “should” opinion of counsel the irs could assert that hillshire brands has not satisfied the requirements for taxfree treatment and such assertion if successful could result in significant us federal income tax liabilities for us 

events subsequent to the spinoff could cause the spinoff to become taxable under the terms of the tax sharing agreement hillshire brands entered into with demb in connection with the spinoff demb will generally be required to indemnify hillshire brands for 100 of any taxes imposed on demb and its subsidiaries or hillshire brands and its subsidiaries in the event that the spinoff and certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment as a result of an acquisition of demb including the acquisition of demb by ja benckiser or actions or omissions including breaches of certain representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement by demb or any of its affiliates however if the spinoff or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment because of actions or omissions by hillshire brands or any of its affiliates hillshire brands would be responsible for all such taxes in addition hillshire brands would be responsible for 50 of any taxes resulting from the failure of the spinoff and certain related transactions to qualify as taxfree which failure is not due to actions or omissions including breaches of certain representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement by hillshire brands demb or any of hillshire brands’ or dembs respective subsidiaries there can be no assurance that the tax sharing agreement will be sufficient to protect hillshire brands against any tax liabilities that may arise or that demb will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations hillshire brands’ inability to enforce the indemnification provisions of the tax sharing agreement or obtain indemnification payments in a timely manner could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

multiemployer pension plan could adversely affect our business 

through our wholly owned subsidiary hillshire brands we participate in a “multiemployer” pension plan administered by a labor union representing some of its employees we are required to make periodic contributions to this plan to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to this fund could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to this fund inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plans funding of vested benefits the multiemployer plan in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal was to occur with respect to the multiemployer plan the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 

volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states the difference between plan obligations and assets which signifies the funded status of the plans is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements as of september 27 2014 the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of  381 million  as compared to an underfunded position of  86 million  at the end of fiscal 2013 the increase in the underfunded position is due to the acquisition of hillshire brands changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities the repurchases of senior notes repayment of term loans and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions

 capital resources 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed capacity of 125 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs letters of credit and a source of financing for growth opportunities as of september 27 2014  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 41 million  issued under this facility none of which were drawn upon which left 1209 million  available for borrowing our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 42 banks with commitments ranging from 03 million to 85 million per bank the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements 

capitalization 

to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our longterm financing decisions at september 27 2014  and september 28 2013  the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 41x and 07x respectively refer to part ii item 6 selected financial data for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures the increase in this ratio for fiscal 2014 is due to the additional debt incurred related to the hillshire brands acquisition as previously described we incurred 2300 million in term loans 3243 million in senior unsecured notes and 205 million in the debt component of tangible equity units additionally as part of the transaction we assumed 868 million of senior notes and other debt from hillshire brands 

credit ratings 

2016 notes 

on february 11 2013 standard  poors ratings services sp upgraded the credit rating of the 2016 notes from bbb to bbb this upgrade did not impact the interest rate on the 2016 notes 

on june 7 2012 moodys investors service inc moodys upgraded the credit rating of the 2016 notes from ba1 to baa3 this upgrade decreased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 685 to 660 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due october 1 2012 

a onenotch downgrade by moodys would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 025 a twonotch downgrade from sp would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 025 

revolving credit facility 

sp’s corporate credit rating for tyson foods inc is bbb moody’s senior unsecured subsidiary guaranteed longterm debt rating for tyson foods inc is baa3 fitch ratings fitch issuer default rating for tyson foods inc is bbb the below table outlines the fees paid on the unused portion of the facility facility fee rate and letter of credit fees undrawn letter of credit fee and borrowing spread depending on the rating levels of tyson foods inc from sp moodys and fitch 



in the event the rating levels are split the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level in effect for two of the rating agencies or if all three rating agencies have different rating levels the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level that is between the rating levels of the other two rating agencies 

debt covenants 

our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our senior notes and term loans also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september 27 2014  

pension plans 

as further described in part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pension and other postretirement benefits the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of  381 million  at the end of fiscal 2014 as compared to an underfunded position of  86 million  at the end of fiscal 2013 the increase in the underfunded position is due to the acquisition of hillshire brands 

we expect to contribute approximately 14 million  of cash to our pension plans in 2015 as compared to approximately 9 million  in 2014 and 8 million  in 2013 the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors including minimum funding requirements as a result the actual funding in 2015 may be different from the estimate 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties including leases and grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of september 27 2014  

  

 in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 206 million and related interest and penalties of 54 million  at september 27 2014  recorded as liabilities 

the maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at september 27 2014  based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 330 million  or approximately 326 million  remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash flow assistance related receivables 

recently issuedadopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to the discussion under part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of significant accounting policies for recently issued accounting pronouncements and note 2 changes in accounting principles for recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

  









impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets 

description  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary if it is determined based on qualitative factors the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than carrying amount or if significant changes to macroeconomic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a twostep process the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the quantitative impairment test is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize if any 

the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount then goodwill is not considered impaired however if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination ie the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay for the same business 

for other indefinite life intangible assets a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired similar to goodwill we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we elected to forgo the qualitative assessments on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2014 impairment test 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

judgments and uncertainties  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using various valuation techniques with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates 

we include assumptions about sales operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets business plans and economic projections and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units industries 

other indefinite life intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years other than the adoption of the new guidance allowing the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative impairment test 

the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test decreased to an average of 79 in fiscal 2014 from 84 in fiscal 2013 there were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions 

during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis and therefore the second step was not necessary 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates and our credit ratings while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other indefinite life intangible assets it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value we may be required to perform the second step which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill 

all of our material reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test at september 27 2014 48 billion of goodwill associated with our acquisition of hillshire brands has not yet been allocated to our reporting units the allocation of this goodwill to our reporting units is pending finalization of the expected synergies and the impact of the synergies to our reporting units 

our fiscal 2014 other indefinite life intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge a hypothetical 20 decrease in the fair value of nonhillshire brands intangible assets would not result in a material impairment we recorded 41 billion of indefinite life intangibles brands and trademarks associated with our acquisition of hillshire brands any significant decline in the estimated fair value of the hillshire brands indefinite life intangibles could result in a material impairment 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk  we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 27 2014  and september 28 2013  on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 



interest rate risk  at september 27 2014  we had variable rate debt of 21 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 16 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at september 27 2014  and september 28 2013  would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at september 27 2014  we had fixedrate debt of 61 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 43 market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 109 million at september 27 2014  and 22 million at september 28 2013  the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

we have interest rate risk associated with our pension and postretirement benefit obligations changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 pensions and other postretirement benefits for additional information 

foreign currency risk  we have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currencies we have exposure to are the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro the indian rupee and the mexican peso we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at september 27 2014  and september 28 2013  related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have a 9 million and 11 million impact respectively on pretax income 

concentrations of credit risk  our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at september 27 2014  and september 28 2013  186  and 175  respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart stores inc no other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

chicken  the primary raw materials used in our chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants where they are slaughtered and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate our own feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2013  corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 71  of our cost of growing a live chicken in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase live icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

beef  the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities we believe the sources of supply of live cattle are adequate for our present needs 

pork  the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the sources of supply of live hogs are adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of live swine for our own processing needs 

prepared foods  the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including chicken beef pork corn flour and vegetables some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for chicken and beef products generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and prepared foods products generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand generally decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for 130  of our fiscal 2013  consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in the chicken beef pork and prepared foods segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2013  consolidated sales 

competition 

our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers additionally our food products compete in markets around the world 

we seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy which includes 

 past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy as supported by our distribution systems the principal competitive elements are price product safety and quality brand identification breadth and depth of product offerings availability of products customer service and credit terms

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing chicken beef pork and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress and the united states environmental protection agency are considering various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time when or if such options will be finalized or what the final form may be due to the uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our chicken beef pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the united states department of agriculture usda and the united states food and drug administration fda we are also participants in the united states hazard analysis critical control point haccp program and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002

marketing and distribution 

our principal marketing objective is to be the primary provider of chicken beef pork and prepared foods products for our customers and consumers as such we utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products on an ongoing basis we identify distinct markets and business opportunities through continuous consumer and market research in addition to supporting strong regional brands across multiple protein lines we build the tyson brand and tyson owned brands primarily through welldefined productspecific advertising and public relations efforts focused toward key consumer targets with specific needs these efforts are designed to present key tyson products as everyday solutions to relevant consumer problems thereby becoming part of regular eating routines 

we have the ability to produce and ship fresh frozen and refrigerated products worldwide domestically our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our owned or leased cold storage warehouses public cold storage facilities and our transportation system our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate partialtruckload orders into full truckloads thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service in addition we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental united states internationally we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations 

patents and trademarks 

we have filed a number of patents and trademarks relating to our processes and products that either have been approved or are in the process of application because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our products we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts we also have developed nonpublic proprietary information regarding our production processes and other productrelated matters we utilize internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information and where appropriate seek patent andor trademark protection for the technology we utilize 

industry practices 

our agreements with customers are generally shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practices and fluctuations in supply demand and price for such products in certain instances where we are selling further processed products to large customers we may enter into written agreements whereby we will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer with pricing terms that are either fixed or variable

among the factors that may cause actual results and experiences to differ from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements are the following i the effect of or changes in general economic conditions ii fluctuations in the cost and availability of inputs and raw materials such as live cattle live swine feed grains including corn and soybean meal and energy iii market conditions for finished products including competition from other global and domestic food processors supply and pricing of competing products and alternative proteins and demand for alternative proteins iv successful rationalization of existing facilities and operating efficiencies of the facilities v risks associated with our commodity purchasing activities vi access to foreign markets together with foreign economic conditions including currency fluctuations importexport restrictions and foreign politics vii outbreak of a livestock disease such as avian influenza ai or bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse which could have an adverse effect on livestock we own the availability of livestock we purchase consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to access certain domestic and foreign markets viii changes in availability and relative costs of labor and contract growers and our ability to maintain good relationships with employees labor unions contract growers and independent producers providing us livestock ix issues related to food safety including costs resulting from product recalls regulatory compliance and any related claims or litigation x changes in consumer preference and diets and our ability to identify and react to consumer trends xi significant marketing plan changes by large customers or loss of one or more large customers xii adverse results from litigation xiii risks associated with leverage including cost increases due to rising interest rates or changes in debt ratings or outlook xiv compliance with and changes to regulations and laws both domestic and foreign including changes in accounting standards tax laws environmental laws agricultural laws and occupational health and safety laws xv our ability to make effective acquisitions or joint ventures and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into existing operations xvi effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs and xvii those factors listed under item 1a “risk factors” 




 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the cost and supply of raw materials such as feed grains live cattle live swine energy and ingredients as well as the selling prices for our products many of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients are major production costs for verticallyintegrated poultry processors such as us representing roughly 71  of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2013  as a result fluctuations in prices for these feed ingredients which include competing demand for corn and soybean meal for use in the manufacture of renewable energy can adversely affect our earnings production of feed ingredients is affected by among other things weather patterns throughout the world the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

we have cattle under contract at feed yards owned by third parties however most of the cattle we process are purchased from independent producers we have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers who help secure a supply of livestock for daily startup operations at our facilities the majority of our live swine supply is obtained through procurement arrangements with independent producers we also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are required for processing in addition we raise live swine and sell feeder pigs to independent producers for feeding to processing weight and have contract growers feed a minimal amount of companyowned live swine for our own processing needs any decrease in the supply of cattle or swine on the spot market could increase the price of these raw materials and further increase per head cost of production due to lower capacity utilization which could adversely affect our financial results 

market supply and demand and the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

we face competition from other food producers and processors some of the factors on which we compete and which may drive demand for our products include 

 demand for our products also is affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs and the availability or price of competing proteins 

we attempt to obtain prices for our products that reflect in part the price we must pay for the raw materials that go into our products if we are not able to obtain higher prices for our products when the price we pay for raw materials increases we may be unable to maintain positive margins 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 

demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

we are subject to risks associated with our international activities which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2013  we sold products to approximately 130  countries major sales markets include brazil canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east south korea taiwan and vietnam our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2013  totaled 57 billion of which 42 billion  related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 485 million  of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily brazil china mexico and india at the end of fiscal 2013  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 7 

negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 115000  employees approximately 38000  of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment therefore there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further processing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls which may not entirely mitigate the risk of product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

our operations are subject to general risks of litigation 

we are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers shareholders employees or injured persons and claims relating to commercial labor employment antitrust securities or environmental matters litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect our financial results 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into saleleaseback or hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our 450 senior notes due june 2022 also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the carrying value of goodwill we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under the income approach we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the goodwill valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of september 28 2013  we had 19 billion  of goodwill which represented approximately 16  of total assets 

domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products our facilities for processing chicken beef pork prepared foods and milling feed and for housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and to the health and safety of our employees our domestic chicken beef and pork processing facilities are participants in the haccp program and are subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 in addition our products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the fda also our livestock procurement and poultry growout activities are regulated by the grain inspection packers and stockyards administration which is part of usda’s marketing and regulatory programs loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified laws regulations and accounting standards if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

a material acquisition joint venture or other significant initiative could affect our operations and financial condition 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives collectively “transactions” and we may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services which could include material transactions a material transaction may involve a number of risks including 

 we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

 changes in consumer preference could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for 130  of our sales in fiscal 2013  many of our agreements with our customers are shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for our products 

the consolidation of customers could negatively impact our business 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products any of which would adversely affect our financial results 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors as well as disruptions in our information systems could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

media campaigns related to food production present risks  

media outlets including new social media platforms provide the opportunity for individuals or organizations to publicize inappropriate or inaccurate stories or perceptions about our company or the food production industry such practices have the ability to cause damage to our brands the industry generally or consumers perceptions of our company or the food production industry and may result in negative publicity and adversely affect our financial results 

our renewable energy ventures and other initiatives might not be successful 

we have been exploring ways to convert animal fats and other byproducts from our operations into valueadded products for example our joint venture dynamic fuels produces renewable synthetic fuels we will continue to explore other ways to commercialize opportunities outside our core business such as renewable energy and other technologicallyadvanced platforms these initiatives might not be as financially successful as we initially announced or might expect due to factors that include but are not limited to availability of tax credits competing energy prices failure to operate at the volumes anticipated abilities of our joint venture partners and our limited experience in some of these new areas 

tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control 

as of september 28 2013  tyson limited partnership the tlp owns 99981  of the outstanding shares of the companys class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and the tlp and members of the tyson family own in the aggregate 209  of the outstanding shares of the companys class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them collectively control of approximately 7246  of the total voting power of the companys outstanding voting stock at this time the tlp does not have a managing general partner as such the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners as of september 28 2013  mr john tyson chairman of the board of directors has 3333  of the general partner percentage interests and ms barbara tyson a director of the company has 11115  general partner percentage interests the remaining general partnership interests are held by the tyson partnership interest trust  4444  and harry c erwin iii  11115  as a result of these holdings positions and directorships the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tlps significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we are eligible for “controlled company” exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange

fiscal 2014 outlook 

in fiscal 2014 we expect overall domestic protein production chicken beef pork and turkey to increase approximately 1 from fiscal 2013 levels grain supplies are expected to increase in fiscal 2014 which should result in lower input costs the following is a summary of the fiscal 2014 outlook for each of our segments as well as an outlook on sales capital expenditures net interest expense debt and liquidity share repurchases and dividends   

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities the repurchases of senior notes and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions 



 

 26 



 27 



 generally we do not rely on the foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs rather we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations our us income taxes net of applicable foreign tax credits have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so 

 capital resources 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed maximum capacity of 10 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs letters of credit and a source of financing for growth opportunities as of september 28 2013  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 42 million  issued under this facility none of which were drawn upon which left 958 million  available for borrowing our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 44 banks with commitments ranging from 03 million to 90 million per bank the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements 

capitalization 

to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization as support for our longterm financing decisions at september 28 2013  and september 29 2012  the ratio of our debttototal capitalization was 279  and 287  respectively for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of current and longterm debt total capitalization is defined as debt plus total shareholders’ equity 

warrants 

in september 2008 in conjunction with the issuance of convertible bonds we sold warrants in private transactions for total proceeds of 44 million the warrants permit the purchasers to acquire up to approximately 27 million shares of our class a stock at the current exercise price of 2216 per share subject to adjustment the warrants are exercisable on various dates from january 2014 through april 2014 a 10 increase in our share price above the 2216 warrant exercise price would result in the issuance of 25 million incremental shares at 2860 our closing share price on september 28 2013 the incremental shares we would be required to issue upon exercise of the warrants would have resulted in 61 million shares 

credit ratings

on february 11 2013 sp upgraded the credit rating of the 2016 notes from bbb to bbb this upgrade did not impact the interest rate on the 2016 notes 

a onenotch downgrade by moodys would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 025 a twonotch downgrade from sp would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 025

in the event the rating levels are split the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level in effect for two of the rating agencies or if all three rating agencies have different rating levels the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level that is between the rating levels of the other two rating agencies 

debt covenants 

our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into saleleaseback or hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our 2022 notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september 28 2013  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties including a lease and grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 20 commitments and contingencies for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of september 28 2013  

  

 

in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 175 million  and related interest and penalties of 63 million  at september 28 2013  recorded as liabilities 

the maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at september 28 2013  based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 340 million  or approximately 296 million  remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash flow assistance related receivables 

recently issuedadopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to the discussion under part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of significant accounting policies for recently issued accounting pronouncements and note 2 changes in accounting principles for recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

  







impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets 

description  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary if it is determined based on qualitative factors the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than carrying amount or if significant changes to macroeconomic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a twostep process the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the quantitative impairment test is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize if any 

the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount then goodwill is not considered impaired however if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination ie the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay for the same business 

for other indefinite life intangible assets a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired similar to goodwill we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we elected to forgo the qualitative assessments on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2013 impairment test 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

judgments and uncertainties  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units generally our operating segments using various valuation techniques with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates 

we include assumptions about sales operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets business plans and economic projections and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units industries 

other indefinite life intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years other than the adoption of the new guidance allowing the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative impairment test 

the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to an average of 84 in fiscal 2013 from 80 in fiscal 2012 there were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions 

during fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis and therefore the second step was not necessary 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates and our credit ratings while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other indefinite life intangible assets it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value we may be required to perform the second step which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill 

all of our material reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test 

our fiscal other indefinite life intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge a hypothetical 20 decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk  we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 28 2013  and september 29 2012  on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 



interest rate risk  at september 28 2013  we had variable rate debt of 173 million with a weighted average interest rate of 34 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at september 28 2013  and september 29 2012  would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at september 28 2013  we had fixedrate debt of 22 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 60 market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 22 million at september 28 2013  and 16 million at september 29 2012  the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

foreign currency risk  we have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currencies we have exposure to are the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro the indian rupee and the mexican peso we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at september 28 2013  and september 29 2012  related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have a 11 million and 21 million impact respectively on pretax income in the future we may enter into more foreign exchange forward and option contracts as a result of our international growth strategy 

concentrations of credit risk  our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at september 28 2013  and september 29 2012  175  and 171  respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart stores inc no other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

chicken  the primary raw materials used in our chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants where they are slaughtered and converted into finished products which are then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate our own feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2012  corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 69  of our cost of growing a live chicken in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase live icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

beef  the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities we believe the sources of supply of live cattle are adequate for our present needs 

pork  the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the sources of supply of live hogs are adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of live swine for our own processing needs 

prepared foods  the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including chicken beef pork corn flour and vegetables some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for chicken and beef products generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and prepared foods products generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for 138  of our fiscal 2012  consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in the chicken beef pork and prepared foods segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2012  consolidated sales 

competition 

our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers additionally our food products compete in markets around the world 

we seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy which includes 

 past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy as supported by our distribution systems the principal competitive elements are price product safety and quality brand identification breadth and depth of product offerings availability of products customer service and credit terms 

international 

we sold products to approximately 130  countries in fiscal 2012  major sales markets include brazil canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east russia south korea taiwan ukraine and vietnam 

we have the following international operations 

 our tyson do brazil shandong tyson and jiangsutyson subsidiaries are currently in startup phase we continue to evaluate growth opportunities in foreign countries additional information regarding export sales longlived assets located in foreign countries and income loss from foreign operations is set forth in note 16 segment reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

research and development 

we conduct continuous research and development activities to improve product development to automate manual processes in our processing plants and growout operations and to improve chicken breeding stock our discovery center includes 19 research kitchens and a usdainspected pilot plant the discovery center enables us to bring new marketleading retail and foodservice products to the customer quickly and efficiently research and development costs totaled 43 million  42 million  and 38 million  in fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing chicken beef pork and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress and the united states environmental protection agency are considering various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time when or if such options will be finalized or what the final form may be due to the uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our chicken beef pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the united states department of agriculture usda and the united states food and drug administration fda we are also participants in the united states hazard analysis critical control point haccp program and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 

employees and labor relations 

as of september 29 2012  we employed approximately 115000  employees approximately 96000  employees were employed in the united states and 19000  employees were in foreign countries primarily china mexico and brazil approximately 29000  employees in the united states were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions with approximately 19  of those employees included under agreements expiring in fiscal 2013 the remaining agreements expire over the next several years approximately 8000  employees in foreign countries were subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe our overall relations with our workforce are good 

marketing and distribution 

our principal marketing objective is to be the primary provider of chicken beef pork and prepared foods products for our customers and consumers as such we utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products on an ongoing basis we identify distinct markets and business opportunities through continuous consumer and market research in addition to supporting strong regional brands across multiple protein lines we build the tyson brand and tyson owned brands primarily through welldefined productspecific advertising and public relations efforts focused toward key consumer targets with specific needs these efforts are designed to present key tyson products as everyday solutions to relevant consumer problems thereby becoming part of regular eating routines 

we have the ability to produce and ship fresh frozen and refrigerated products worldwide domestically our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our owned or leased cold storage warehouses public cold storage facilities and our transportation system our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate lessthantruckload orders into full truckloads thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service in addition we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental united states internationally we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations 

patents and trademarks 

we have filed a number of patents and trademarks relating to our processes and products that either have been approved or are in the process of application because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our products we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts we also have developed nonpublic proprietary information regarding our production processes and other productrelated matters we utilize internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information and where appropriate seek patent andor trademark protection for the technology we utilize 

industry practices 

our agreements with customers are generally shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practices and fluctuations in supply demand and price for such products in certain instances where we are selling further processed products to large customers we may enter into written agreements whereby we will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer with pricing terms that are either fixed or variable

among the factors that may cause actual results and experiences to differ from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements are the following i the effect of or changes in general economic conditions ii fluctuations in the cost and availability of inputs and raw materials such as live cattle live swine feed grains including corn and soybean meal and energy iii market conditions for finished products including competition from other global and domestic food processors supply and pricing of competing products and alternative proteins and demand for alternative proteins iv successful rationalization of existing facilities and operating efficiencies of the facilities v risks associated with our commodity purchasing activities vi access to foreign markets together with foreign economic conditions including currency fluctuations importexport restrictions and foreign politics vii outbreak of a livestock disease such as avian influenza ai or bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse which could have an adverse effect on livestock we own the availability of livestock we purchase consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to access certain domestic and foreign markets viii changes in availability and relative costs of labor and contract growers and our ability to maintain good relationships with employees labor unions contract growers and independent producers providing us livestock ix issues related to food safety including costs resulting from product recalls regulatory compliance and any related claims or litigation x changes in consumer preference and diets and our ability to identify and react to consumer trends xi significant marketing plan changes by large customers or loss of one or more large customers xii adverse results from litigation xiii risks associated with leverage including cost increases due to rising interest rates or changes in debt ratings or outlook xiv compliance with and changes to regulations and laws both domestic and foreign including changes in accounting standards tax laws environmental laws agricultural laws and occupational health and safety laws xv our ability to make effective acquisitions or joint ventures and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into existing operations xvi effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs and xvii those factors listed under item 1a “risk factors” 




 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the cost and supply of raw materials such as feed grains live cattle live swine energy and ingredients as well as the selling prices for our products many of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients are major production costs for verticallyintegrated poultry processors such as us representing roughly 69  of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2012  as a result fluctuations in prices for these feed ingredients which include competing demand for corn and soybean meal for use in the manufacture of renewable energy can adversely affect our earnings production of feed ingredients is affected by among other things weather patterns throughout the world the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

we have cattle under contract at feed yards owned by third parties however most of the cattle we process are purchased from independent producers we have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers who help secure a supply of livestock for daily startup operations at our facilities the majority of our live swine supply is obtained through procurement arrangements with independent producers we also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are required for processing in addition we raise live swine and sell feeder pigs to independent producers for feeding to processing weight and have contract growers feed a minimal amount of companyowned live swine for our own processing needs any decrease in the supply of cattle or swine on the spot market could increase the price of these raw materials and further increase per head cost of production due to lower capacity utilization which could adversely affect our financial results 

market supply and demand and the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

we face competition from other food producers and processors some of the factors on which we compete and which may drive demand for our products include 

 demand for our products also is affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs and the availability or price of competing proteins 

we attempt to obtain prices for our products that reflect in part the price we must pay for the raw materials that go into our products if we are not able to obtain higher prices for our products when the price we pay for raw materials increases we may be unable to maintain positive margins 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 

demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

we are subject to risks associated with our international activities which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2012  we sold products to approximately 130  countries major sales markets include brazil canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east russia south korea taiwan ukraine and vietnam our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2012  totaled 55 billion of which 40 billion  related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 564 million  of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily brazil china mexico and india at the end of fiscal 2012  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 8 

negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 115000  employees approximately 37000  of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment therefore there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further processing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls which may not entirely mitigate the risk of product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

our operations are subject to general risks of litigation 

we are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers shareholders employees or injured persons and claims relating to commercial labor employment antitrust securities or environmental matters litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect our financial results 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate dispose of or transfer assets change the nature of our business engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into saleleaseback or hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios 

our 450 senior notes due june 2022 also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens engage in certain saleleaseback transactions and engage in certain consolidations mergers and sales of assets 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the carrying value of goodwill we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under the income approach we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the goodwill valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of september 29 2012  we had 19 billion  of goodwill which represented approximately 16  of total assets 

domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products our facilities for processing chicken beef pork prepared foods and milling feed and for housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and to the health and safety of our employees our domestic chicken beef and pork processing facilities are participants in the haccp program and are subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 in addition our products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the fda also our livestock procurement and poultry growout activities are regulated by the grain inspection packers and stockyards administration which is part of usda’s marketing and regulatory programs loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified laws regulations and accounting standards if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

a material acquisition joint venture or other significant initiative could affect our operations and financial condition 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives collectively “transactions” and we may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services which could include material transactions a material transaction may involve a number of risks including 

 we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

 changes in consumer preference could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for 138  of our sales in fiscal 2012  many of our agreements with our customers are shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for our products 

the consolidation of customers could negatively impact our business 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products any of which would adversely affect our financial results 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors as well as disruptions in our information systems could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

media campaigns related to food production present risks  

media outlets including new social media platforms provide the opportunity for individuals or organizations to publicize inappropriate or inaccurate stories or perceptions about our company or the food production industry such practices have the ability to cause damage to our brands the industry generally or consumers perceptions of our company or the food production industry and may result in negative publicity and adversely affect our financial results 

our renewable energy ventures and other initiatives might not be successful 

we have been exploring ways to convert animal fats and other byproducts from our operations into valueadded products for example our joint venture dynamic fuels produces renewable synthetic fuels we will continue to explore other ways to commercialize opportunities outside our core business such as renewable energy and other technologicallyadvanced platforms these initiatives might not be as financially successful as we initially announced or might expect due to factors that include but are not limited to availability of tax credits competing energy prices failure to operate at the volumes anticipated abilities of our joint venture partners and our limited experience in some of these new areas

 capital resources 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed maximum capacity of 10 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs letters of credit and a source of financing for growth opportunities as of september 29 2012  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 38 million  issued under this facility none of which were drawn upon which left 962 million  available for borrowing our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 43 banks with commitments ranging from 03 million to 90 million per bank the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements 

capitalization 

to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization as support for our longterm financing decisions at september 29 2012  and october 1 2011  the ratio of our debttototal capitalization was 287 and 277 respectively for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of current and longterm debt total capitalization is defined as debt plus total shareholders’ equity our ratio of debt to our total capitalization increased in fiscal 2012 primarily resulting from the net increase in our debt balance from issuing the 10 billion 2022 notes and extinguishing the 810 million 2014 notes

refer to the discussion under part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of significant accounting policies for recently issued accounting pronouncements and note 2 changes in accounting principles for recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

  







impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

description  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary if it is determined based on qualitative factors the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than carrying amount or if significant changes to macroeconomic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required additionally we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a twostep process the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the quantitative impairment test is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize if any 

the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount then goodwill is not considered impaired however if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination ie the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay for the same business 

for other indefinite life intangible assets a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired similar to goodwill we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test upon performing the quantitative test if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we elected to forgo the qualitative assessments on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2012 impairment test 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

judgments and uncertainties  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units generally our operating segments using various valuation techniques with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates 

we include assumptions about sales operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets business plans and economic projections and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units industries for the fiscal 2012 impairment test of material reporting units our domestic chicken and beef reporting units generally utilized operating margins in future years in excess of the operating margin realized in the most recent year 

our domestic chicken reporting unit had goodwill at september 29 2012 totaling 900 million or 95 of our chicken segments goodwill we generally assumed operating margins in future years would return to our normalized range of 50 to 70 as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year we would have still passed the first step of the annual impairment test valuing the domestic chicken reporting unit utilizing projected operating margins averaging less than 33 breakeven or a 23 increase in the discount rate used in fiscal 2012 would have caused the carrying value of the domestic chicken reporting unit to be in excess of fair value which would have required the second step to be performed although our domestic chicken reporting unit realized operating margins in fiscal 2012 in excess of the breakeven operating margins required to pass the first step the domestic chicken reporting unit may be challenged in fiscal 2013 to realize this level of operating margins due to the expected temporary challenging market conditions in fiscal 2013 

our beef reporting unit which is our beef operating segment had goodwill at september 29 2012 totaling 563 million we generally assumed operating margins in future years would return to our normalized range of 25 to 45 as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year we would have still passed the first step of the annual impairment test valuing the beef reporting unit utilizing projected operating margins averaging less than 14 breakeven or a 36 increase in the discount rate used in fiscal 2012 would have caused the carrying value of the beef reporting unit to be in excess of fair value which would have required the second step to be performed although our beef reporting unit realized operating margins in fiscal 2012 in excess of the breakeven operating margins required to pass the first step the beef reporting unit may be challenged in fiscal 2013 to realize this level of operating margins due to the expected temporary challenging market conditions in fiscal 2013 

other indefinite life intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years other than the adoption of the new guidance allowing the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative impairment test 

the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test decreased to an average of 80 in fiscal 2012 from 88 in fiscal 2011 there were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions 

during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis and therefore the second step was not necessary in fiscal 2010 we recorded a 29 million full impairment of an immaterial chicken segment reporting units goodwill 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates and our credit ratings while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other indefinite life intangible assets it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value we may be required to perform the second step which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill 

all of our material reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination consequently we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test 

our fiscal 2012 other indefinite life intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in a material impairment charge a hypothetical 20 decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk  we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 29 2012  and october 1 2011  on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 



interest rate risk  at september 29 2012  we had variable rate debt of 219 million with a weighted average interest rate of 39 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at september 29 2012  and october 1 2011  would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at september 29 2012  we had fixedrate debt of 22 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 59 market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 16 million at september 29 2012  and 5 million at october 1 2011  the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

foreign currency risk  we have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currencies we have exposure to are the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro and the mexican peso we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at september 29 2012  and october 1 2011  related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have a 21 million and 18 million impact respectively on pretax income in the future we may enter into more foreign exchange forward and option contracts as a result of our international growth strategy 

concentrations of credit risk  our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at september 29 2012  and october 1 2011  171  and 165  respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart stores inc no other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

the results from dynamic fuels are included in other 

raw materials and sources of supply 

chicken the primary raw materials used in our chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants which are slaughtered and converted into finished products then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate our own feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2011 corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients were major production costs representing roughly 69 of our cost of growing a live chicken in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers we also purchase live icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production and sales requirements 

beef the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and public auctions and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities we believe the sources of supply of live cattle are adequate for our present needs 

pork the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ buyers who make purchase agreements of various time durations as well as purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the sources of supply of live hogs are adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of live swine for our own processing needs 

prepared foods the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including chicken beef pork corn flour and vegetables some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for chicken and beef products generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and prepared foods products generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for 133 of our fiscal 2011 consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in the chicken beef pork and prepared foods segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represented more than 10 of fiscal 2011 consolidated sales 

  

competition 

our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers additionally our food products compete in markets around the world 

we seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy which includes 

   past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy as supported by our distribution systems the principal competitive elements are price product safety and quality brand identification breadth and depth of product offerings availability of products customer service and credit terms 

international 

we sold products to more than 130 countries in fiscal 2011 major sales markets include canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east russia south korea taiwan and vietnam 

we have the following international operations 

 

        we continue to evaluate growth opportunities in foreign countries additional information regarding export sales longlived assets located in foreign countries and income loss from foreign operations is set forth in note 16 segment reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

research and development 

we conduct continuous research and development activities to improve product development to automate manual processes in our processing plants and growout operations and to improve chicken breeding stock in 2007 we opened the discovery center which includes 19 research kitchens and a usdainspected pilot plant the discovery center brings new marketleading retail and foodservice products to the customer faster and more effectively research and development costs totaled 42 million 38 million and 33 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing chicken beef pork and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress and the united states environmental protection agency are considering various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time when or if such options will be finalized or what the final form may be due to the uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

  

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our chicken beef pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the united states department of agriculture usda and the united states food and drug administration fda we are also participants in the united states hazard analysis critical control point haccp program and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 

employees and labor relations 

as of october 1 2011 we employed approximately 115000 employees approximately 97000 employees were employed in the united states and 18000 employees were in foreign countries primarily china mexico and brazil approximately 29000 employees in the united states were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions with approximately 40 of those employees included under agreements expiring in fiscal 2012 the remaining agreements expire over the next several years approximately 7000 employees in foreign countries were subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe our overall relations with our workforce are good 

marketing and distribution 

our principal marketing objective is to be the primary provider of chicken beef pork and prepared foods products for our customers and consumers as such we utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products on an ongoing basis we identify distinct markets and business opportunities through continuous consumer and market research in addition to supporting strong regional brands across multiple protein lines we build the tyson brand and tyson owned brands primarily through welldefined productspecific advertising and public relations efforts focused toward key consumer targets with specific needs these efforts are designed to present key tyson products as everyday solutions to relevant consumer problems thereby becoming part of regular eating routines 

we have the ability to produce and ship fresh frozen and refrigerated products worldwide domestically our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our owned or leased cold storage warehouses public cold storage facilities and our transportation system our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate lessthantruckload orders into full truckloads thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service in addition we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental united states internationally we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations 

patents and trademarks 

we have filed a number of patents and trademarks relating to our processes and products that either have been approved or are in the process of application because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our products we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts we also have developed nonpublic proprietary information regarding our production processes and other productrelated matters we utilize internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information and where appropriate seek patent andor trademark protection for the technology we utilize 

industry practices 

our agreements with customers are generally shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practices and fluctuations in supply demand and price for such products in certain instances where we are selling further processed products to large customers we may enter into written agreements whereby we will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer with pricing terms that are either fixed or variable 

availability of sec filings and corporate governance documents on internet website

cautionary statements relevant to forwardlooking information for the purpose of “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

certain information in this report constitutes forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to current views and estimates of our outlook for fiscal 2012 other future economic circumstances industry conditions in domestic and international markets our performance and financial results eg debt levels return on invested capital valueadded product growth capital expenditures tax rates access to foreign markets and dividend policy these forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and experiences to differ materially from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements we wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date made we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

among the factors that may cause actual results and experiences to differ from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements are the following i the effect of or changes in general economic conditions ii fluctuations in the cost and availability of inputs and raw materials such as live cattle live swine feed grains including corn and soybean meal and energy iii market conditions for finished products including competition from other global and domestic food processors supply and pricing of competing products and alternative proteins and demand for alternative proteins iv successful rationalization of existing facilities and operating efficiencies of the facilities v risks associated with our commodity purchasing activities vi access to foreign markets together with foreign economic conditions including currency fluctuations importexport restrictions and foreign politics vii outbreak of a livestock disease such as avian influenza ai or bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse which could have an adverse effect on livestock we own the availability of livestock we purchase consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to access certain domestic and foreign markets viii changes in availability and relative costs of labor and contract growers and our ability to maintain good relationships with employees labor unions contract growers and independent producers providing us livestock ix issues related to food safety including costs resulting from product recalls regulatory compliance and any related claims or litigation x changes in consumer preference and diets and our ability to identify and react to consumer trends xi significant marketing plan changes by large customers or loss of one or more large customers xii adverse results from litigation xiii risks associated with leverage including cost increases due to rising interest rates or changes in debt ratings or outlook xiv compliance with and changes to regulations and laws both domestic and foreign including changes in accounting standards tax laws environmental laws agricultural laws and occupational health and safety laws xv our ability to make effective acquisitions or joint ventures and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into existing operations xvi effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs and xvii those factors listed under item 1a “risk factors” 




 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the cost and supply of raw materials such as feed grains live cattle live swine energy and ingredients as well as the selling prices for our products many of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control corn soybean meal and other feed ingredients are major production costs for verticallyintegrated poultry processors such as us representing roughly 69 of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2011 as a result fluctuations in prices for these feed ingredients which include competing demand for corn and soybean meal for use in the manufacture of renewable energy can adversely affect our earnings production of feed ingredients is affected by among other things weather patterns throughout the world the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

we have cattle under contract at feed yards owned by third parties however most of the cattle we process are purchased from independent producers we have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers who help secure a supply of livestock for daily startup operations at our facilities the majority of our live swine supply is obtained through procurement arrangements with independent producers we also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are required for processing in addition we raise live swine and sell feeder pigs to independent producers for feeding to processing weight and have contract growers feed a minimal amount of companyowned live swine for our own processing needs any decrease in the supply of cattle or swine on the spot market could increase the price of these raw materials and further increase per head cost of production due to lower capacity utilization which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

market supply and demand and the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

we face competition from other food producers and processors some of the factors on which we compete and which may drive demand for our products include 

 

       demand for our products also is affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs and the availability or price of competing proteins 

we attempt to obtain prices for our products that reflect in part the price we must pay for the raw materials that go into our products if we are not able to obtain higher prices for our products when the price we pay for raw materials increases we may be unable to maintain positive margins 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 

demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

we are subject to risks associated with our international operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2011 we sold products to more than 130 countries major sales markets include canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east russia south korea taiwan and vietnam our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2011 totaled 55 billion of which 41 billion related to export sales from the united states in addition we had approximately 539 million of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily brazil china mexico and india at the end of fiscal 2011 

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 

           

negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 115000 employees approximately 36000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment therefore there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further processing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls which may not entirely mitigate the risk of product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

our operations are subject to general risks of litigation 

we are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers shareholders employees or injured persons and claims relating to commercial labor employment antitrust securities or environmental matters litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect our financial results 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 

     our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our capital stock amend material documents change the nature of our business make certain payments of debt engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into saleleaseback or hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum leverage ratios 

our 1050 senior notes due march 2014 also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to incur additional debt and issue preferred stock make certain investments and restricted payments create liens create restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock enter into transactions with affiliates enter new lines of business engage in consolidation mergers and acquisitions and engage in certain saleleaseback transactions 

  

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the carrying value of goodwill we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under the income approach we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the goodwill valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of october 1 2011 we had 19 billion of goodwill which represented approximately 171 of total assets 

domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products our facilities for processing chicken beef pork prepared foods and milling feed and for housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and to the health and safety of our employees our chicken beef and pork processing facilities are participants in the haccp program and are subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 in addition our products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the fda also our livestock procurement and poultry growout activities are regulated by the grain inspection packers and stockyards administration which is part of usda’s marketing and regulatory programs loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified laws regulations and accounting standards if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

a material acquisition joint venture or other significant initiative could affect our operations and financial condition 

we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives collectively “transactions” and we may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services which could include material transactions a material transaction may involve a number of risks including 

 

     we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

  

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

 

       changes in consumer preference could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for 133 of our sales in fiscal 2011 many of our agreements with our customers are shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for our products 

the consolidation of customers could negatively impact our business 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products any of which would adversely affect our financial results 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors as well as disruptions in our information systems could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

our renewable energy ventures and other initiatives might not be successful 

we have been exploring ways to convert animal fats and other byproducts from our operations into valueadded products for example in fiscal 2007 we announced the formation of dynamic fuels a joint venture with syntroleum corporation we will continue to explore other ways to commercialize opportunities outside our core business such as renewable energy and other technologicallyadvanced platforms these initiatives might not be as financially successful as we initially announced or might expect due to factors that include but are not limited to possible discontinuance of tax credits competing energy prices failure to operate at the volumes anticipated abilities of our joint venture partners and our limited experience in some of these new areas 

tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control 

as of october 1 2011 tyson limited partnership the tlp owns 9997 of the outstanding shares of class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and the tlp and members of the tyson family own in the aggregate 245 of the outstanding shares of class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them collectively control of approximately 7074 of the total voting power of the outstanding voting stock at this time the tlp does not have a managing general partner and as such the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners as of october 1 2011 mr john tyson chairman of the board of directors has 3333 of the general partner percentage interests and ms barbara tyson a director of the company has 11115 general partner percentage interests the remaining general partnership interests are held by the tyson partnership interest trust 4444 and harry c erwin iii 11115 as a result of these holdings positions and directorships the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated 

  

certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tyson family’s significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we rely on the “controlled company” exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange

 liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities the repurchases of senior notes and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions

    capital resources 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary source of liquidity for funding debt service capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed maximum capacity of 10 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs letters of credit and a source of financing for growth opportunities as of october 1 2011 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 158 million none of which were drawn upon which left 842 million available for borrowing our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 38 banks with commitments ranging from 3 million to 90 million per bank the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements 

capitalization 

to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for longterm financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization as support for our longterm financing decisions at october 1 2011 and october 2 2010 the ratio of our debttototal capitalization was 277 and 328 respectively for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of current and longterm debt total capitalization is defined as debt plus total shareholders’ equity our ratio of debt to our total capitalization decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily resulting from reduced debt balances and increased retained earnings associated with strong earnings in fiscal 2011 

credit ratings 

2016 notes 

on september 4 2008 standard  poor’s sp downgraded the credit rating from “bbb” to “bb” this downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 685 to 735 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due october 1 2008 

on november 13 2008 moody’s investors services inc moody’s downgraded the credit rating from “ba1” to “ba3” this downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 735 to 785 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due april 1 2009 

on august 19 2010 sp upgraded the credit rating from “bb” to “bb” on september 2 2010 moody’s upgraded the credit rating from “ba3” to “ba2” these upgrades decreased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 785 to 735 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due october 1 2010 

on february 24 2011 sp upgraded the credit rating of these notes from “bb” to “bbb” on march 29 2011 moody’s upgraded our credit rating from “ba2” to “ba1” these upgrades decreased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 735 to 685 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due april 1 2011 

a further onenotch upgrade by moody’s would decrease the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 025 while a onenotch downgrade by either ratings agency would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 025 

  

revolving credit facility 

sp’s corporate credit rating for tyson foods inc is “bbb” moody’s corporate credit rating for tyson foods inc is “ba1” if moody’s were to upgrade our credit rating to “baa2” or higher while our sp credit rating remained at “bbb” or sp were to upgrade our credit rating to “bbb” or higher while moody’s upgraded our credit rating to “baa3” or higher our letter of credit fees would decrease by 025 and fees paid on the unused portion of the facility would decrease by 0075 

if sp were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to “bb” or moody’s were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to “ba2” our letter of credit fees would increase by 025 and fees paid on the unused portion of the facility would increase by 0025 

debt covenants 

our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our capital stock amend material documents change the nature of our business make certain payments of debt engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into saleleaseback or hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions in addition we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum leverage ratios 

our 2014 notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to incur additional debt and issue preferred stock make certain investments and restricted payments create liens create restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock enter into transactions with affiliates enter new lines of business engage in consolidation mergers and acquisitions and engage in certain saleleaseback transactions 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october 1 2011 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties including a lease and grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see note 19 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 1 2011 

 

  

         

in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 174 million and related interest and penalties of 58 million at october 1 2011 recorded as liabilities during fiscal 2012 tax audit resolutions could potentially reduce these amounts by approximately 10 million either because tax positions are sustained on audit or because we agree to their disallowance 

the maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at october 1 2011 based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 220 million or approximately 192 million remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash flow assistance related receivables

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

 

   

   

   

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

description goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize if any 

the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount then goodwill is not considered impaired however if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination ie the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay for the same business 

for other indefinite life intangible assets if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets however we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if among other things we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

judgments and uncertainties we estimate the fair value of our reporting units generally our operating segments using various valuation techniques with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis which uses significant unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates 

we include assumptions about sales operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets business plans and economic projections and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period generally we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units’ industries for the fiscal 2011 impairment test of material reporting units only our domestic chicken reporting unit utilized operating margins in future years in excess of the operating margin realized in the most recent year 

our domestic chicken reporting unit had goodwill at october 1 2011 totaling 900 million or 95 of our chicken segment’s goodwill we assumed operating margins in future years would return to our normalized range of 50 to 70 as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year we would have failed the first step of the annual impairment test which would have required the second step to be performed and may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss the current year domestic chicken reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction in assessing the appropriate operating margins to be utilized in estimating the fair value of the domestic chicken segment we considered many factors including the following 

 

  

  

 other indefinite life intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years 

the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to an average of 88 in fiscal 2011 from 84 in fiscal 2010 there were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions 

other than the beef reporting unit in 2009 no material reporting units failed the first step of the annual goodwill impairment analysis in fiscal 2011 2010 or 2009 and therefore the second step was not necessary in fiscal 2009 we recorded a 560 million partial impairment of our beef reporting unit’s goodwill which was driven by an increase in our discount rate used in the 2009 annual goodwill impairment analysis as a result of disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions in fiscal 2010 we recorded a 29 million full impairment of an immaterial chicken segment reporting unit’s goodwill 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including interest rates cost of capital tax rates and our credit ratings while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other indefinite life intangible assets it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value we may be required to perform the second step which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill 

if the domestic chicken reporting unit experienced a 15 or more decline in fair value at july 1 2011 it would have caused the carrying value of the reporting unit to be in excess of fair value which would have required the second step to be performed additionally valuing the domestic chicken reporting unit utilizing projected operating margins averaging less than 40 or a 09 increase in the discount rate used in fiscal 2011 would have caused the carrying value of the domestic chicken reporting unit to be in excess of fair value which would have required the second step to be performed the second step may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss all other material reporting units’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 consequently we do not consider any of our other material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test 

our fiscal 2011 other indefinite life intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in a material impairment charge a hypothetical 20 decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of october 1 2011 and october 2 2010 on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 

 

   

interest rate risk at october 1 2011 we had variable rate debt of 211 million with a weighted average interest rate of 41 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at october 1 2011 and october 2 2010 would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at october 1 2011 we had fixedrate debt of 20 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 92 market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 5 million at october 1 2011 and 9 million at october 2 2010 the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

foreign currency risk we have foreign exchange gainloss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currency exchanges we have exposure to are the brazilian real the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the european euro and the mexican peso we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at october 1 2011 and october 2 2010 related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have an 18 million and 17 million impact respectively on pretax income in the future we may enter into more foreign exchange forward and option contracts as a result of our international growth strategy 

concentrations of credit risk our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at october 1 2011 and october 2 2010 165 and 153 respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart stores inc no other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

chicken the primary raw materials used in our chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants which are slaughtered and converted into finished products then sent to distribution centers and delivered to customers 

we operate our own feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2010 corn and soybean meal were major production costs representing roughly 42 of our cost of growing a live chicken in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers from timetotime we purchase live icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production requirements 

beef the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but employ cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities we believe the sources of supply of live cattle are adequate for our present needs 

pork the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the sources of supply of live hogs are adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of live swine for our own processing needs 

prepared foods the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including chicken beef pork corn flour and vegetables some of these raw materials are provided by our other segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for chicken and beef products generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and prepared foods products generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for 134 of our fiscal 2010 consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in the chicken beef pork and prepared foods segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represents more than 10 of fiscal 2010 consolidated sales 

  

competition 

our food products compete with those of other food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers additionally our food products compete in markets around the world 

we seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy which includes 

   past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy as supported by our distribution systems the principal competitive elements are price product safety and quality brand identification breadth and depth of product offerings availability of products customer service and credit terms 

international 

we exported to more than 100 countries in fiscal 2010 major export markets include canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east russia south korea taiwan and vietnam 

we have the following international operations 

 

        we continue to evaluate growth opportunities in foreign countries additional information regarding export sales longlived assets located in foreign countries and income loss from foreign operations is set forth in note 20 segment reporting of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

research and development 

we conduct continuous research and development activities to improve product development to automate manual processes in our processing plants and growout operations and to improve chicken breeding stock in 2007 we opened the discovery center which includes 19 research kitchens and a usdainspected pilot plant the discovery center brings new marketleading retail and foodservice products to the customer faster and more effectively research and development costs totaled 38 million 33 million and 30 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing chicken beef pork and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress and the united states environmental protection agency are considering various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time when or if such options will be finalized or what the final form may be due to the uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

  

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our chicken beef pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the united states department of agriculture usda and the united states food and drug administration fda we are also participants in the united states hazard analysis critical control point haccp program and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 

employees and labor relations 

as of october 2 2010 we employed approximately 115000 employees approximately 97000 employees were employed in the united states and 18000 employees were in foreign countries primarily china mexico and brazil approximately 29000 employees in the united states were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions with approximately 19 of those employees included under agreements expiring in fiscal 2011 these agreements expire over periods throughout the next several years approximately 7000 employees in foreign countries were subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe our overall relations with our workforce are good 

marketing and distribution 

our principal marketing objective is to be the primary provider of chicken beef pork and prepared foods products for our customers and consumers as such we utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products on an ongoing basis we identify distinct markets and business opportunities through continuous consumer and market research in addition to supporting strong regional brands across multiple protein lines we build the tyson brand primarily through welldefined productspecific advertising and public relations efforts focused toward key consumer targets with specific needs these efforts are designed to present key tyson products as everyday solutions to relevant consumer problems thereby becoming part of regular eating routines we utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve a leading market position for our products 

we have the ability to produce and ship fresh frozen and refrigerated products worldwide domestically our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our owned or leased cold storage warehouses public cold storage facilities and our transportation system our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate lessthantruckload orders into full truckloads thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service in addition we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental united states internationally we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations 

patents and trademarks 

we have filed a number of patents and trademarks relating to our processes and products that either have been approved or are in the process of application because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our products we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts we also have developed nonpublic proprietary information regarding our production processes and other productrelated matters we utilize internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information and where appropriate seek patent andor trademark protection for the technology we utilize 

industry practices 

our agreements with customers are generally shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practices and fluctuations in supply demand and price for such products in certain instances where we are selling further processed products to large customers we may enter into written agreements whereby we will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer with pricing terms that are either fixed or variable due to volatility of the cost of raw materials fixed price contracts are generally limited to three months in duration

among the factors that may cause actual results and experiences to differ from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements are the following i the effect of or changes in general economic conditions ii fluctuations in the cost and availability of inputs and raw materials such as live cattle live swine feed grains including corn and soybean meal and energy iii market conditions for finished products including competition from other global and domestic food processors supply and pricing of competing products and alternative proteins and demand for alternative proteins iv successful rationalization of existing facilities and operating efficiencies of the facilities v risks associated with our commodity purchasing activities vi access to foreign markets together with foreign economic conditions including currency fluctuations importexport restrictions and foreign politics vii outbreak of a livestock disease such as avian influenza ai or bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse which could have an effect on livestock we own the availability of livestock we purchase consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to access certain domestic and foreign markets viii changes in availability and relative costs of labor and contract growers and our ability to maintain good relationships with employees labor unions contract growers and independent producers providing us livestock ix issues related to food safety including costs resulting from product recalls regulatory compliance and any related claims or litigation x changes in consumer preference and diets and our ability to identify and react to consumer trends xi significant marketing plan changes by large customers or loss of one or more large customers xii adverse results from litigation xiii risks associated with leverage including cost increases due to rising interest rates or changes in debt ratings or outlook xiv compliance with and changes to regulations and laws both domestic and foreign including changes in accounting standards tax laws environmental laws agricultural laws and occupational health and safety laws xv our ability to make effective acquisitions or joint ventures and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into existing operations xvi effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs and xvii those factors listed under item 1a “risk factors” 




 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the cost and supply of raw materials such as feed grains live cattle live swine energy and ingredients as well as the selling prices for our products many of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control corn and soybean meal are major production costs for verticallyintegrated poultry processors such as us representing roughly 42 of our cost of growing a chicken in fiscal 2010 as a result fluctuations in prices for these feed ingredients which include competing demand for corn and soybean meal for use in the manufacture of renewable energy can adversely affect our earnings production of feed ingredients is affected by among other things weather patterns throughout the world the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

we have cattle under contract at feed yards owned by third parties however most of the cattle we process are purchased from independent producers we have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers who help secure a supply of livestock for daily startup operations at our facilities the majority of our live swine supply is obtained through procurement arrangements with independent producers we also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are required for processing in addition we raise live swine and sell feeder pigs to independent producers for feeding to processing weight and have contract growers feed a minimal amount of companyowned live swine for our own processing needs any decrease in the supply of cattle or swine on the spot market could increase the price of these raw materials and further increase per head cost of production due to lower capacity utilization which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

market demand and the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors 

we face competition from other food producers and processors some of the factors on which we compete and which may drive demand for our products include 

 

       demand for our products also is affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs and the availability or price of competing proteins 

we attempt to obtain prices for our products that reflect in part the price we must pay for the raw materials that go into our products if we are not able to obtain higher prices for our products when the price we pay for raw materials increases we may be unable to maintain positive margins 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 

demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

we are subject to risks associated with our international operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2010 we exported to more than 100 countries major export markets include canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east russia south korea taiwan and vietnam our export sales for fiscal 2010 totaled 32 billion in addition we had approximately 364 million of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily brazil china mexico and india at the end of fiscal 2010 

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 

           

negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 115000 employees approximately 36000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and e coli these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment therefore there is a risk that one or more as a result of food processing could be present in our products these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further processing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls which may not entirely mitigate the risk of product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

our operations are subject to general risks of litigation 

we are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers shareholders employees or injured persons and claims relating to commercial labor employment antitrust securities or environmental matters litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect our financial results 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 

     our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our capital stock amend material documents change the nature of our business make certain payments of debt engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into saleleaseback or hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions if availability under this facility is less than the greater of 15 of the commitments and 150 million we will be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 

our 1050 senior notes due march 2014 also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to incur additional debt and issue preferred stock make certain investments and restricted payments create liens create restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock enter into transactions with affiliates enter new lines of business engage in consolidation mergers and acquisitions and engage in certain saleleaseback transactions 

  

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the carrying value of goodwill we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction under the income approach we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the goodwill valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which could be substantial as of october 2 2010 we had 19 billion of goodwill which represented approximately 176 of total assets 

domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products our facilities for processing chicken beef pork prepared foods and milling feed and for housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and to the health and safety of our employees our chicken beef and pork processing facilities are participants in the haccp program and are subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 in addition our products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the fda also our livestock procurement and poultry growout activities are regulated by the grain inspection packers and stockyards administration gipsa which is part of usda’s marketing and regulatory programs loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified laws regulations and accounting standards if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

a material acquisition joint venture or other significant initiative could affect our operations and financial condition 

we have recently completed acquisitions and entered into joint venture agreements and periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives collectively “transactions” and we may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services which could include material transactions a material transaction may involve a number of risks including 

 

     we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions including inflation interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

  

disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

 

       changes in consumer preference could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for 134 of our sales in fiscal 2010 many of our agreements with our customers are shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for our products 

the consolidation of customers could negatively impact our business 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products any of which would adversely affect our financial results 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors as well as disruptions in our information systems could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

our renewable energy ventures and other initiatives might not be as successful as we expect 

we have been exploring ways to commercialize animal fats and other byproducts from our operations as well as the poultry litter of our contract growers to generate energy and other valueadded products for example in fiscal 2007 we announced the formation of dynamic fuels llc a joint venture with syntroleum corporation we will continue to explore other ways to commercialize opportunities outside our core business such as renewable energy and other technologicallyadvanced platforms these initiatives might not be as financially successful as we initially announced or would expect due to factors that include but are not limited to possible discontinuance of tax credits competing energy prices failure to operate at the volumes anticipated abilities of our joint venture partners and our limited experience in some of these new areas 

members of the tyson family can exercise significant control 

members of the tyson family beneficially own in the aggregate 9997 of our outstanding shares of class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and 242 of our outstanding shares of class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them control of approximately 70 of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock in addition three members of the tyson family serve on our board of directors as a result members of the tyson family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tyson family’s significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we rely on the “controlled company” exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange

2009 –the disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions led to an increase in our discount rate in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to 101 in fiscal 2009 from 93 in fiscal 2008 there were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions the increased discount rate resulted in the noncash partial impairment of our beef reporting unit’s goodwill the impairment has no impact on managements’ estimates of the beef segment’s longterm profitability or value

 liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities and the repurchaseredemption of our 2011 notes are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions 

 

 cash flows associated with changes in working capital 

     

  

      

  

             

  

     deterioration of credit and capital markets 

credit market conditions deteriorated rapidly during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and although they have improved they have not returned to pre2008 levels several major banks and financial institutions failed or were forced to seek assistance through distressed sales or emergency government measures while not allinclusive the following summarizes some of the impacts to our business 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary source of liquidity for funding debt service and capital expenditures we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed maximum capacity of 10 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs letters of credit and as a source of financing for growth opportunities as of october 2 2010 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 175 million none of which were drawn upon which left 825 million available for borrowing our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 19 banks with commitments ranging from 6 million to 115 million per bank the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements if any of the banks in the syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility our liquidity could be impaired which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs support letters of credit or finance our growth opportunities 

customerssuppliers 

the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers could also be impaired by current market conditions although we have not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts or nonperformance by suppliers current market conditions increase the probability we could experience losses from customer or supplier defaults should credit and capital market conditions result in a prolonged economic downturn in the united states and abroad demand for protein products could be reduced which could result in a reduction of sales operating income and cash flows in addition we rely on livestock producers throughout the country to supply our live cattle and hogs if these producers are adversely impacted by the current economic conditions and terminate their production our livestock supply for processing could be significantly impacted 

  

additionally we have cash flow assistance programs in which certain livestock suppliers participate under these programs we pay an amount for livestock equivalent to a standard cost to grow such livestock during periods of low market sales prices the amounts of such payments that are in excess of the market sales price are recorded as receivables and accrue interest participating suppliers are obligated to repay these receivables balances when market sales prices exceed this standard cost or upon termination of the agreement our maximum obligation associated with these programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock supplier’s net tangible assets although we believe the aggregate maximum obligation under the program is unlikely to ever be reached the potential maximum obligation as of october 2 2010 was approximately 215 million the total receivables under these programs were 51 million and 72 million at october 2 2010 and october 3 2009 respectively even though these programs are limited to the net tangible assets of the participating livestock suppliers we also manage a portion of our credit risk associated with these programs by obtaining security interests in livestock suppliers’ assets after analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions we have recorded an allowance for these programs’ estimated uncollectible receivables of 15 million and 20 million at october 2 2010 and october 3 2009 respectively 

investments 

the value of our investments in equity and debt securities including our marketable debt securities companyowned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets are impacted by market volatility these instruments were recorded at fair value as of october 2 2010 we did not have a significant change in fair value of these instruments during fiscal 2010 

we currently oversee two domestic and one foreign subsidiary noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans all three pension plans are frozen to new participants and no additional benefits will accrue for participants based on our 2010 actuarial valuation we anticipate contributions of 5 million to these plans for fiscal 2011 we also have one domestic unfunded defined benefit plan based on our 2010 actuarial valuation we anticipate contributions of 2 million to this plan in fiscal 2011 

financial instruments 

as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to commodity purchases similar to the capital markets the commodities markets have been volatile over the past few years grain and some energy prices remain volatile after reaching an alltime high during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 before falling sharply while the reduction in grain and energy prices benefit us longterm we recorded losses related to these financial instruments in fiscal 2009 of 257 million we have implemented policies to reduce our earnings volatility associated with marktomarket derivative activities including more use of normal physical purchases and normal physical sales which are not required to be marked to market 

insurance 

we rely on insurers as a protection against liability claims property damage and various other risks our primary insurers maintain an am best financial strength rating of a or better nevertheless we continue to monitor this situation as insurers have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by the current capital market environment 

  

credit ratings 

2016 notes 

on september 4 2008 standard  poor’s sp downgraded the credit rating from “bbb” to “bb” this downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 685 to 735 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due october 1 2008 

on november 13 2008 moody’s investors services inc moody’s downgraded the credit rating from “ba1” to “ba3” this downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 735 to 785 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due april 1 2009 

on august 19 2010 sp upgraded the credit rating from “bb” to “bb” on september 2 2010 moody’s upgraded the credit rating from “ba3” to “ba2” these upgrades decreased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 785 to 735 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due october 1 2010 

a further onenotch upgrade by either ratings agency would decrease the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 025 while a onenotch downgrade by either ratings agency would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 025 

revolving credit facility 

sp’s corporate credit rating for tyson foods inc is “bb” moody’s corporate credit rating for tyson foods inc is “ba2” if moody’s were to upgrade our credit rating to “ba1” or higher while our sp credit rating remained at “bb” or higher our letter of credit fees would decrease by 025 

if sp were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to “b” or lower or moody’s were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to “b1” or lower our letter of credit fees would increase by an additional 025 

debt covenants 

our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our capital stock amend material documents change the nature of our business make certain payments of debt engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into saleleaseback or hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions if availability under this facility is less than the greater of 15 of the commitments and 150 million we will be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 

our 2014 notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to incur additional debt and issue preferred stock make certain investments and restricted payments create liens create restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock enter into transactions with affiliates enter new lines of business engage in consolidation mergers and acquisitions and engage in certain saleleaseback transactions 

we were in compliance with all covenants at october 2 2010 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties including a lease and grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see note 10 commitments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 2 2010 

 

  

       in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 184 million and related interest and penalties of 64 million at october 2 2010 recorded as liabilities during fiscal 2011 tax audit resolutions could potentially reduce these amounts by approximately 20 million either because tax positions are sustained on audit or because we agree to their disallowance 

the maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at october 2 2010 based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 215 million or approximately 164 million remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash flow assistance related receivables 

the minority partner in our shandong tyson xinchang foods joint ventures in china has the right to exercise put options to require us to purchase its entire 40 equity interest at a price equal to the minority partner’s contributed capital plus minus its prorata share of the joint venture’s accumulated and undistributed net earnings losses the put options are exercisable for a fiveyear term commencing april 2011 at october 2 2010 the put options if they had been exercisable would have resulted in a purchase price of approximately 67 million for the minority partner’s entire equity interest

refer to the discussion under part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 business and summary of significant accounting policies for recently issued accounting pronouncements and note 2 change in accounting principles for recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

 

   

   

   

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

commodities risk we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of october 2 2010 and october 3 2009 on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 

 

 interest rate risk at october 2 2010 we had variable rate debt of 212 million with a weighted average interest rate of 45 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at october 2 2010 and october 3 2009 would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

additionally changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixedrate debt at october 2 2010 we had fixedrate debt of 23 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 92 market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 9 million at october 2 2010 and 32 million at october 3 2009 the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

foreign currency risk we have foreign exchange gainloss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currency exchanges we have exposure to are the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the mexican peso the european euro the british pound sterling and the brazilian real we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at october 2 2010 and october 3 2009 related to the foreign exchange forward contracts would have a 17 million and 15 million respectively impact on pretax income in the future we may enter into more foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of our international growth strategy 

concentrations of credit risk our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at october 2 2010 and october 3 2009 153 and 130 respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart stores inc no other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

chicken the primary raw materials used in our chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants and finished products are sent to distribution centers then delivered to customers 

we operate our own feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2009 corn and soybean meal were major production costs representing roughly 45 of our cost of growing a live chicken in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers from timetotime we purchase live icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production requirements 

beef the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit independent feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for our facilities we believe the sources of supply of live cattle are adequate for our present needs 

pork the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement relationships with independent producers we also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the sources of supply of live hogs are adequate for our present needs additionally we raise a number of weanling swine to sell to independent finishers and supply a minimal amount of live swine for our own processing needs 

prepared foods the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including chicken beef pork corn flour and vegetables some of these raw materials are provided by the chicken beef and pork segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

seasonal demand 

demand for chicken and beef products generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and prepared foods products generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand decreases during the spring and summer months 

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for 138 of our fiscal 2009 consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in the chicken beef pork and prepared foods segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represents more than 10 of fiscal 2009 consolidated sales 

  

  

  

competition 

our food products compete with those of other national and regional food producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers additionally our food products compete in markets around the world 

we seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our principal marketing and competitive strategy which includes 

 

past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased and sustained through application of our marketing strategy as supported by our distribution systems the principal competitive elements are price product safety and quality brand identification breadth and depth of the product offering availability of products customer service and credit terms 

international 

we exported to more than 90 countries in fiscal 2009 major export markets include canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east russia south korea taiwan and vietnam 

we have the following international operations 

 

we continue to explore growth opportunities in foreign countries additional information regarding export sales longlived assets located in foreign countries and income loss from foreign operations is set forth in note 20 “segment reporting” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

research and development 

we conduct continuous research and development activities to improve product development to automate manual processes in our processing plants and growout operations and to improve chicken breeding stock in 2007 we opened the discovery center which includes 19 research kitchens and a usdainspected pilot plant the discovery center brings new marketleading retail and foodservice products to the customer faster and more effectively 

environmental regulation and food safety 

our facilities for processing chicken beef pork and prepared foods milling feed and housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which include provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and generally provide for protection of the environment we believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations of such laws and regulations likely to result in material penalties or material increases in compliance costs the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and except as described below is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect in the future 

congress and the united states environmental protection agency are considering various options to control greenhouse gas emissions it is unclear at this time when or if such options will be finalized or what the final form may be due to the uncertainty surrounding this issue it is premature to speculate on the specific nature of impacts that imposition of greenhouse gas emission controls would have on us and whether such impacts would have a material adverse effect 

  

  

  

we work to ensure our products meet high standards of food safety and quality in addition to our own internal food safety and quality assurance oversight and review our chicken beef pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the united states department of agriculture usda and the united states food and drug administration fda we are also participants in the united states hazard analysis critical control point haccp program and are subject to the sanitation standard operating procedures and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 

employees and labor relations 

as of october 3 2009 we employed approximately 117000 employees approximately 100000 employees were employed in the united states and 17000 employees were in foreign countries primarily china mexico and brazil approximately 33000 employees in the united states were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions with approximately 6 of those employees included under agreements expiring in fiscal 2010 these agreements expire over periods throughout the next several years approximately 7000 employees in foreign countries were subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe our overall relations with our workforce are good 

marketing and distribution 

our principal marketing objective is to be the primary provider of chicken beef pork and prepared foods products for our customers and consumers as such we utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products on an ongoing basis we identify distinct markets and business opportunities through continuous consumer and market research in addition to supporting strong regional brands across multiple protein lines we build the tyson brand primarily through welldefined productspecific advertising and public relations efforts focused toward key consumer targets with specific needs these efforts are designed to present key tyson products as everyday solutions to relevant consumer problems thereby gaining adoption into regular eating routines further we use a coordinated mix of activities designed to connect with our customers and consumers on both rational and emotional levels we utilize our national distribution system and customer support services to achieve the leading market position for our products 

we have the ability to produce and ship fresh frozen and refrigerated products worldwide domestically our distribution system extends to a broad network of food distributors and is supported by our owned or leased cold storage warehouses public cold storage facilities and our transportation system our distribution centers accumulate fresh and frozen products so we can fill and consolidate lessthantruckload orders into full truckloads thereby decreasing shipping costs while increasing customer service in addition we provide our customers a wide selection of products that do not require large volume orders our distribution system enables us to supply large or small quantities of products to meet customer requirements anywhere in the continental united states internationally we utilize both rail and truck refrigerated transportation to domestic ports where consolidations take place to transport to foreign destinations we use ocean and air transportation to meet the delivery needs of our foreign customers 

patents and trademarks 

we have filed a number of patents and trademarks relating to our processes and products that either have been approved or are in the process of application because we do a significant amount of brand name and product line advertising to promote our products we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our marketing efforts we also have developed nonpublic proprietary information regarding our production processes and other productrelated matters we utilize internal procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of such information and where appropriate seek patent andor trademark protection for the technology we utilize 

industry practices 

our agreements with customers are generally shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practices and fluctuations in supply demand and price for such products in certain instances where we are selling further processed products to large customers we may enter into written agreements whereby we will act as the exclusive or preferred supplier to the customer with pricing terms that are either fixed or variable due to volatility of the cost of raw materials fixed price contracts are generally limited to three months in duration

among the factors that may cause actual results and experiences to differ from anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forwardlooking statements are the following i the effect of or changes in general economic conditions ii fluctuations in the cost and availability of inputs and raw materials such as live cattle live swine feed grains including corn and soybean meal and energy iii market conditions for finished products including competition from other global and domestic food processors supply and pricing of competing products and alternative proteins and demand for alternative proteins iv successful rationalization of existing facilities and operating efficiencies of the facilities v risks associated with our commodity trading risk management activities vi access to foreign markets together with foreign economic conditions including currency fluctuations importexport restrictions and foreign politics vii outbreak of a livestock disease such as avian influenza ai or bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse which could have an effect on livestock we own the availability of livestock we purchase consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to access certain domestic and foreign markets viii changes in availability and relative costs of labor and contract growers and our ability to maintain good relationships with employees labor unions contract growers and independent producers providing us livestock ix issues related to food safety including costs resulting from product recalls regulatory compliance and any related claims or litigation x changes in consumer preference and diets and our ability to identify and react to consumer trends xi significant marketing plan changes by large customers or loss of one or more large customers xii adverse results from litigation xiii risks associated with leverage including cost increases due to rising interest rates or changes in debt ratings or outlook xiv compliance with and changes to regulations and laws both domestic and foreign including changes in accounting standards tax laws environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws xv our ability to make effective acquisitions or joint ventures and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into existing operations xvi effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs and xvii those factors listed under item 1a “risk factors” 




 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the cost and supply of raw materials such as feed grains live cattle live swine energy and ingredients as well as the selling prices for our products many of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control corn and soybean meal are major production costs in the poultry industry representing roughly 45 of our cost of growing a chicken in fiscal 2009 as a result fluctuations in prices for these feed ingredients which include competing demand for corn and soybean meal for use in the manufacture of renewable energy can adversely affect our earnings production of feed ingredients is affected by among other things weather patterns throughout the world the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

we have cattle under contract at feed yards owned by third parties however most of the cattle we process are purchased from independent producers we have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the 

  

  

  

open spot market we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers who help secure a supply of livestock for daily startup operations at our facilities the majority of our live swine supply is obtained through various procurement arrangements with independent producers we also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are required for processing in addition we raise live swine and sell feeder pigs to independent producers for feeding to processing weight and have contract growers feed a minimal amount of companyowned live swine for our own processing needs any decrease in the supply of cattle or swine on the spot market could increase the price of these raw materials and further increase per head cost of production due to lower capacity utilization which could adversely affect our financial results 

market demand and the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from global and domestic food producers and processors 

we face competition from other global and domestic food producers and processors some of the factors on which we compete and which may drive demand for our products include 

 

demand for our products also is affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs and the availability or price of competing proteins 

we attempt to obtain prices for our products that reflect in part the price we must pay for the raw materials that go into our products if we are not able to obtain higher prices for our products when the price we pay for raw materials increases we may be unable to maintain positive margins 

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 

demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

we are subject to risks associated with our international operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2009 we exported to more than 90 countries major export markets include canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east russia south korea taiwan and vietnam our export sales for fiscal 2009 totaled 27 billion in addition we had approximately 329 million of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily brazil china and mexico at the end of fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2009 approximately 3 of the loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest was from foreign operations 

  

  

  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

 

negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 117000 employees of whom approximately 40000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and generic e coli these pathogens are found generally in the environment therefore there is a risk they as a result of food processing could be present in our products these pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further processing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over proper handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls which may not entirely mitigate the risk of product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

our operations are subject to general risks of litigation 

we are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers shareholders employees or injured persons and claims relating to commercial labor employment antitrust securities or environmental matters litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect our financial results 

  

  

  

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

 

our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our capital stock amend material documents change the nature of our business make certain payments of debt engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into saleleaseback or hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions if availability under this facility is less than the greater of 15 of the commitments and 150 million we will be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 

our 1050 senior notes due march 2014 also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to incur additional debt and issue preferred stock make certain investments and restricted payments create liens create restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock enter into transactions with affiliates enter new lines of business engage in consolidation mergers and acquisitions and engage in certain saleleaseback transactions 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the recoverability of goodwill we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margin growth rates and discount rates based on our budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit under the income approach we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates the recent disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things cause us to increase the discount rate used in the goodwill valuations we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges in fiscal 2009 we recorded a noncash partial impairment of 560 million of our beef reporting unit’s goodwill as of october 3 2009 we had 19 billion of goodwill which represented approximately 181 of total assets 

domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling and export of our products our facilities for processing chicken beef pork prepared foods and milling feed and for housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and to the health and safety of our employees our chicken beef and pork processing facilities are participants in the haccp program and are subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 in addition our products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the fda loss of or failure to obtain necessary 

  

  

  

permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified laws regulations and accounting standards such as country of origin labeling cool requirements if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

a material acquisition joint venture or other significant initiative could affect our operations and financial condition 

we have recently completed acquisitions and entered into joint venture agreements and periodically evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives collectively “transactions” and we may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services which could include material transactions a material transaction may involve a number of risks including 

 

we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units if we are unable to do this such expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

the recent disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could among other things 

 

changes in consumer preference could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

  

  

the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant set backs in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets should change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for 138 of our sales in fiscal 2009 many of our agreements with our customers are generally shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for our products 

the consolidation of customers could negatively impact our business 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products because of these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products any of which would adversely affect our financial results 

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors as well as disruptions in our information systems could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

our renewable energy ventures and other initiatives might not be as successful as we expect 

we have been exploring ways to commercialize animal fats and other byproducts from our operations as well as the poultry litter of our contract growers to generate energy and other valueadded products for example in fiscal 2007 we announced the formation of dynamic fuels llc a joint venture with syntroleum corporation we will continue to explore other ways to commercialize opportunities outside our core business such as renewable energy and other technologicallyadvanced platforms these initiatives might not be as financially successful as we initially announced or would expect due to factors that include but are not limited to possible discontinuance of tax credits competing energy prices failure to operate at the volumes anticipated abilities of our joint venture partners and our limited experience in some of these new areas 

members of the tyson family can exercise significant control 

members of the tyson family beneficially own in the aggregate 9997 of our outstanding shares of class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and 236 of our outstanding shares of class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them control of approximately 70 of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock in addition three members of the tyson family serve on our board of directors as a result members of the tyson family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tyson family’s significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we have relied on the “controlled company” exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange pursuant to these exemptions our compensation committee which is made up of independent directors does not have sole authority to determine the compensation of our executive officers including our chief executive officer

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for working capital capital expenditures and growth opportunities are expected to be met with current cash on hand cash flows provided by operating activities or shortterm borrowings based on our current expectations we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business however we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance through capital market transactions the amount nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances our thencurrent commitments and obligations the amount nature and timing of our capital requirements any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements and overall market conditions 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

deterioration of credit and capital markets 

credit market conditions deteriorated rapidly during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and continued into fiscal 2009 several major banks and financial institutions failed or were forced to seek assistance through distressed sales or emergency government measures while not allinclusive the following summarizes some of the impacts to our business 

credit facility 

cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service and capital expenditures we also have a revolving credit facility with a committed capacity of 10 billion to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs letters of credit and as a source of financing for growth opportunities as of october 3 2009 we had outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit agreement totaling 267 million none of which were drawn upon which left 733 million available for borrowing our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 19 banks with commitments ranging from 6 million to 115 million per bank if any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility our liquidity could be impaired which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs support letters of credit or finance our growth opportunities 

customerssuppliers 

the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers could also be impaired by current market conditions although we have not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts or nonperformance by suppliers current market conditions increase the probability we could experience losses from customer or supplier defaults should current credit and capital market conditions result in a prolonged economic downturn in the united states and abroad demand for protein products could be reduced which could result in a reduction of sales operating income and cash flows in addition we rely on livestock producers throughout the country to supply our live cattle and hogs if these producers are adversely impacted by the current economic conditions and go out of business our livestock supply for processing could be significantly impacted 

additionally we have cash flow assistance programs in which certain livestock suppliers participate under these programs we pay an amount for livestock equivalent to a standard cost to grow such livestock during periods of low market sales prices the amounts of such payments that are in excess of the market sales price are recorded as receivables and accrue interest participating suppliers are obligated to repay these receivables balances when market sales prices exceed this standard cost or upon termination of the 

  

  

  

agreement our maximum obligation associated with these programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock supplier’s net tangible assets although we believe the aggregate maximum obligation under the program is unlikely to ever be reached the potential maximum obligation as of october 3 2009 is approximately 250 million the total receivables under these programs were 72 million and 7 million at october 3 2009 and september 27 2008 respectively even though these programs are limited to the net tangible assets of the participating livestock suppliers we also manage a portion of our credit risk associated with these programs by obtaining security interests in livestock suppliers assets after analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions we have recorded an allowance for these programs estimated uncollectible receivables of 20 million and 2 million at october 3 2009 and september 27 2008 respectively 

investments 

the value of our investments in equity and debt securities including our marketable debt securities companyowned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets has been impacted by the market volatility over the past year these instruments were recorded at fair value as of october 3 2009 during fiscal 2009 we had a reduction in fair value resulting in the recognition through earnings of 11 million 

we currently oversee two domestic and one foreign subsidiary noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans all three pension plans are frozen to new participants and no additional benefits will accrue for participants based on our 2009 actuarial valuation we anticipate contributions of 2 million to these plans for fiscal 2010 we also have one domestic unfunded defined benefit plan based on our 2009 actuarial valuation we anticipate contributions of 2 million to this plan for fiscal 2010 

financial instruments 

as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to commodity purchases similar to the capital markets the commodities markets have been volatile over the past year grain and some energy prices reached an alltime high during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 before falling sharply while the reduction in grain and energy prices benefit us longterm we recorded losses related to these financial instruments in fiscal 2009 of 257 million we have recently implemented policies to reduce our earnings volatility associated with marktomarket derivative activities including more use of normal physical purchases and normal physical sales which are not required to be marked to market 

insurance 

we rely on insurers as a protection against liability claims property damage and various other risks our primary insurers maintain an am best financial strength rating of a or better nevertheless we continue to monitor this situation as insurers have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by the current capital market environment 

 

 

  

  

  

credit ratings 

2016 notes 

on september 4 2008 standard  poor’s sp downgraded the credit rating from “bbb” to “bb” this downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 685 to 735 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due october 1 2008 

on november 13 2008 moody’s investors services inc moody’s downgraded the credit rating from “ba1” to “ba3” this downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 735 to 785 effective beginning with the sixmonth interest payment due april 1 2009 

sp currently rates the 2016 notes “bb” moody’s currently rates this debt “ba3” a further onenotch downgrade by either ratings agency would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by an additional 025 

revolving credit facility 

sp’s corporate credit rating for tyson foods inc is “bb” moody’s corporate credit rating for tyson foods inc is “ba3” if sp were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to “b” or lower or moody’s were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to “b1” or lower our letter of credit fees would increase by an additional 025 

debt covenants 

our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to create liens and encumbrances incur debt merge dissolve liquidate or consolidate make acquisitions and investments dispose of or transfer assets pay dividends or make other payments in respect to our capital stock amend material documents change the nature of our business make certain payments of debt engage in certain transactions with affiliates and enter into saleleaseback or hedging transactions in each case subject to certain qualifications and exceptions if availability under this facility is less than the greater of 15 of the commitments and 150 million we will be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 

our 2014 notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things may limit or restrict our ability to incur additional debt and issue preferred stock make certain investments and restricted payments create liens create restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock enter into transactions with affiliates enter new lines of business engage in consolidation mergers and acquisitions and engage in certain saleleaseback transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties including a lease and grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see note 10 “commitments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 3 2009 

 

 

  

  

  

 

in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 233 million and related interest and penalties of 71 million at october 3 2009 recorded as liabilities during fiscal 2010 tax audit resolutions could potentially reduce these amounts by approximately 30 million either because tax positions are sustained on audit or because we agree to their disallowance 

the maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at october 3 2009 based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date aggregated to approximately 250 million or approximately 178 million remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash flow assistance related receivables 

the minority partner in our shandong tyson xinchang foods joint ventures in china has the right to exercise put options to require us to purchase their entire 40 equity interest at a price equal to the minority partner’s contributed capital plus minus its prorata share of the joint ventures accumulated and undistributed net earnings losses the put options are exercisable for a fiveyear term commencing the later of i april 2011 or ii the date upon which a shareholder of the minority partner is no longer general manager of the joint venture operations at october 3 2009 the put options if they had been exercisable would have resulted in a purchase price of approximately 74 million for the minority partner’s entire equity interest

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical 

 

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery we record these positions at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

  

  

commodities risk we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of october 3 2009 and september 27 2008 on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 

 

interest rate risk at october 3 2009 we had fixedrate debt of 33 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 79 we have exposure to changes in interest rates on this fixedrate debt market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 32 million at october 3 2009 and 45 million at september 27 2008 the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

at october 3 2009 we had variable rate debt of 218 million with a weighted average interest rate of 43 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at october 3 2009 and september 27 2008 would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

foreign currency risk we have foreign exchange gainloss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currency exchanges we have exposure to are the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the mexican peso the european euro the british pound sterling and the brazilian real we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at october 3 2009 and september 27 2008 related to the foreign exchange forward contracts would have a 15 million and 11 million respectively impact on pretax income in the future we may enter into more foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of our international growth strategy 

concentrations of credit risk our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at october 3 2009 and september 27 2008 130 and 122 respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart stores inc no other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

chicken the primary raw materials used in our chicken operations are corn and soybean meal used as feed and live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards with advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are transported to processing plants and finished products are sent to distribution centers then delivered to customers 

  

we operate our own feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2008 corn and soybean meal were major production costs representing roughly 47 of our cost of growing a live chicken in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce nearly all our inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers from timetotime we purchase live icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production requirements 

  

beef the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle but have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers to secure a supply of livestock for daily startup operations at our facilities we believe the sources of supply of live cattle are adequate for our present needs 

  

pork the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement arrangements with independent producers we also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we believe the sources of supply of live hogs are adequate for our present needs additionally we raise live swine to sell to outside processors and supply a minimal amount of live swine for our own processing needs 

  

prepared foods the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including chicken beef pork corn flour and vegetables some of these raw materials are provided by the chicken beef and pork segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers we believe the sources of supply of raw materials are adequate for our present needs 

  

seasonal demand 

demand for chicken and beef products generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and prepared foods products generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand decreases during the spring and summer months 

  

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for 133 of our fiscal 2008 consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in the chicken beef pork and prepared foods segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represents more than 10 of fiscal 2008 consolidated sales

 item 1a risk factors 

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and energy could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the cost and supply of raw materials such as feed grains live cattle live swine energy and ingredients as well as the selling prices for our products many of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control corn and soybean meal are major production costs in the poultry industry representing roughly 47 of our cost of growing a chicken in fiscal 2008 as a result fluctuations in prices for these feed ingredients which include competing demand for corn and soybean meal for use in the manufacture of renewable energy can adversely affect our earnings production of feed ingredients is affected by among other things weather patterns throughout the world the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments 

  

we have cattle under contract at feed yards owned by third parties however most of the cattle we process are purchased from independent producers we have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers who help secure a supply of livestock for daily startup operations at our facilities the majority of our live swine supply is obtained through various procurement arrangements with independent producers we also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are required for processing in addition we raise live swine and sell feeder pigs to independent producers for feeding to processing weight and have contract growers feed a minimal amount of companyowned live swine for our own processing needs any decrease in the supply of cattle or swine on the spot market could increase the price of these raw materials and further increase per head cost of production due to lower capacity utilization which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

market demand and the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from global and domestic food processors 

we face competition from other global national and regional food producers and processors the factors on which we compete include 

  

 

  

demand for our products also is affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs and the availability or price of competing proteins 

  

  

tyson foods inc 

  

we attempt to obtain prices for our products that reflect in part the price we must pay for the raw materials that go into our products if we are not able to obtain higher prices for our products when the price we pay for raw materials increases we may be unable to maintain positive margins 

  

outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 

demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases such as strains of avian influenza and bovine spongiform encephalopathy which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken beef or other products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

  

we are subject to risks associated with our international operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2008 we exported to more than 90 countries major export markets include canada central america china the european union japan mexico the middle east russia south korea and taiwan our export sales for fiscal 2008 totaled 32 billion in addition we had approximately 139 million of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily mexico at the end of fiscal 2008 approximately 22 of income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2008 was from foreign operations 

  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

  

 

  

occurrence of any of these events in the markets where we operate or in other developing markets could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in those markets and could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

excluding our lakeside discontinued operation we have approximately 107000 employees of whom approximately 31000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with our growers or maintain marketing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

  

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and generic e coli these pathogens are found generally in the environment therefore there is a risk they as a result of food processing could be present in our products these pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper 

  

  

tyson foods inc 

handling at the further processing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over proper handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls which may not entirely mitigate the risk of product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

our operations are subject to general risks of litigation 

we are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers shareholders employees or injured persons and claims relating to commercial labor employment antitrust securities or environmental matters litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

at september 27 2008 we had approximately 29 billion of indebtedness outstanding we had a borrowing capacity of 15 billion consisting of 709 million available under our 10 billion revolving credit facility and 750 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility at september 27 2008 we expect our indebtedness including borrowings under our credit agreements may increase from time to time in the future for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because 

  

 

  

in addition our debt agreements require us to meet specified financial ratios and limit our ability to enter into various transactions our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance we will meet those ratios if we default on any of our indebtedness or if we are unable to obtain necessary liquidity our indebtedness would be due and payable immediately and our business could be adversely affected 

  

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the recoverability of goodwill we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margin growth rates and discount rates based on our budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges in addition impairment charges would negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future as of september 27 2008 we had 25 billion of goodwill which represented approximately 231 of total assets 

  

domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising and labeling of our products our facilities for processing chicken beef pork prepared foods and milling feed and for housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and to the health and safety of our employees our chicken beef and pork processing facilities are participants in the haccp program and are subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 in addition our chicken beef pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the fda loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified laws regulations and accounting standards such as recently enacted country of origin labeling cool requirements if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal 

  

  

tyson foods inc 

sanctions any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

a material acquisition joint venture or other significant initiative could affect our operations and financial condition 

we have recently completed acquisitions and joint venture agreements and continually evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives collectively “transactions” and we may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services from others which could include material transactions a material transaction may involve a number of risks including 

  

 

  

we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units of our company if we are unable to do this expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

  

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

  

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our beef poultry and pork products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

  

the recent disruptions in credit and other financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could among other things 

  

 

  

changes in consumer preference could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant set backs in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets should change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for 133 of our sales in fiscal 2008 many of our agreements with our customers are generally shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for our products 

  

  

tyson foods inc 

the consolidation of customers could negatively impact our business 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products if we fail to respond to these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products any of which would adversely affect our financial results 

  

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors as well as disruptions in our information systems could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

our renewable energy ventures and other initiatives might not be as successful as we expect 

we have been exploring ways to commercialize animal fats and other byproducts from our operations as well as the poultry litter of our contract growers to generate energy and other valueadded products for example in fiscal 2007 we announced the formation of dynamic fuels a joint venture with syntroleum corporation we will continue to explore other ways to commercialize opportunities outside our core business such as renewable energy and other technologicallyadvanced platforms these initiatives might not be as financially successful as we initially announced or would expect due to factors that include but are not limited to possible discontinuance of tax credits competing energy prices failure to operate at the volumes anticipated abilities of our joint venture partners and our limited experience in some of these new areas 

  

members of the tyson family can exercise significant control 

members of the tyson family beneficially own in the aggregate 9997 of our outstanding shares of class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and 231 of our outstanding shares of class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them control of approximately 70 of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock in addition three members of the tyson family serve on our board of directors as a result members of the tyson family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tyson family’s significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we have relied on the “controlled company” exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange pursuant to these exemptions our compensation committee which is made up of independent directors does not have sole authority to determine the compensation of our executive officers including our chief executive officer

deterioration of credit and capital markets 

credit market conditions deteriorated rapidly during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and continue into our first quarter of fiscal 2009 several major banks and financial institutions failed or were forced to seek assistance through distressed sales or emergency government measures while not allinclusive the following summarizes some of the impacts to our business 

  

credit facilities 

cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding debt service and capital expenditures however we rely on our revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs letters of credit and as a source of financing for international growth our revolving credit facility has total committed capacity of 10 billion as of september 27 2008 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 291 million none of which were drawn upon which left 709 million available for borrowing our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 35 banks with commitments ranging from 5 million to 78 million per bank if any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility our liquidity could be impaired which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs or finance our international growth strategy 

  

our accounts receivable securitization facility has 750 million of committed funding of which the entire amount was available for borrowing as of september 27 2008 our accounts receivable securitization facility is funded by a syndicate of three banks with a commitment of 250 million per bank to date all of the banks in the syndicate have continued to meet their commitments despite the recent market turmoil if any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility our liquidity could be impaired which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs or finance our international growth strategy we have borrowed against this facility subsequent to fiscal 2008 and all of the banks in the syndicate performed their obligations to fund these borrowings 

  

  

tyson foods inc 

current market conditions have also resulted in higher credit spreads on longterm borrowings and significantly reduced demand for new corporate debt issuances 

  

equity – class a common stock 

equity prices including our own class a common stock have fallen and experienced abnormally high volatility during the current period if these conditions persist our cost of capital will increase significantly 

  

customerssuppliers 

the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers could also be impaired by current market conditions although we have not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts or nonperformance by suppliers current market conditions increase the probability that we could experience losses from customer or supplier defaults should current credit and capital market conditions result in a prolonged economic downturn in the united states and abroad demand for protein products could be reduced which could result in a reduction of sales operating income and cash flows 

  

investments 

the value of our investments in equity and debt securities including our marketable debt securities companyowned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets has been negatively impacted by the recent market declines these instruments were recorded at fair value as of september 27 2008 however subsequent to september 27 2008 through november 1 2008 we have seen an additional reduction in fair value of approximately 32 million while we believe this reduction in fair value is temporary if current market conditions continue we could be required to recognize 10 million of expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 the remaining change in fair value would be deferred in other comprehensive income unless determined to be permanently impaired 

  

we currently oversee two domestic and one foreign subsidiary noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans all three pension plans are frozen to new participants and no additional benefits will accrue for participants based on our 2008 actuarial valuation we anticipate contributions of approximately 1 million to these plans for fiscal 2009 we also have one domestic unfunded defined benefit plan based on our 2008 actuarial valuation we anticipate contributions of approximately 1 million to this plan in fiscal 2009 

  

financial instruments 

as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to commodity purchases similar to the capital markets the commodities markets have seen a similar decline over the past several months grain prices reached an alltime high during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 before falling sharply to the current levels while the reduction in grain prices benefit us longterm we may be required to record additional losses related to these financial instruments in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 if grain prices remain lower than prices at the end of fiscal 2008 

  

insurance 

we rely on insurers as a protection against liability claims property damage and various other risks our primary insurers maintain an am best financial strength rating of a or better nevertheless we continue to monitor this situation as insurers have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by the current capital market environment

credit ratings 

2016 notes 

on july 24 2006 moody’s investors services inc moody’s downgraded the credit rating from “baa3” to “ba1” this downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 660 to 685 effective on the first day of the interest period during which the rating change required an adjustment to the interest rate ie the issuance of the 2016 notes additionally on july 31 2006 standard  poor’s sp downgraded the credit rating from “bbb” to “bbb” this downgrade did not change the interest rate on the 2016 notes 

  

on september 4 2008 sp downgraded the credit rating from “bbb“ to “bb” this downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 685 to 735 effective beginning with the six month interest payment due october 1 2008 

  

on november 13 2008 moody’s downgraded the credit rating from “ba1” to “ba3” this downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 735 to 785 effective beginning with the six month interest payment due april 1 2009 

  

sp currently rates the 2016 notes “bb” moody’s currently rates this debt “ba3” a further onenotch downgrade by either ratings agency would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by an additional 025 per ratings agency 

  

revolving credit facility rating 

after an upgrade on october 1 2008 sp’s credit rating for the revolving credit facility is “bbb” after a downgrade on november 13 2008 moody’s credit rating is “ba2” the pretax impact to earnings of another downgrade would not be material to annual interest expense however if moody’s were to downgrade this facility to “ba3” or below or if sp were to downgrade this facility to “bb“ or below then the banks participating in our accounts receivable securitization facility could refuse to purchase any additional receivables from us and the accounts receivable securitization facility could unwind with any amounts outstanding under the facility repaid as the receivables owned by tyson receivables company our whollyowned consolidated special purpose entity are collected 

  

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain various covenants the most restrictive of which contain maximum allowed leverage ratios and a minimum required interest coverage ratio on september 10 2008 we amended our revolving credit facility agreement to provide a less restrictive maximum allowed leverage ratio which takes effect in first quarter of fiscal 2009 all trademarks of our domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the revolving credit facility additionally certain domestic subsidiaries guaranteed this facility and pledged inventory as collateral we were in compliance with all covenants at september 27 2008 

  

based on the current industry outlook and our internal forecasts we anticipate we will be in compliance with our debt covenants throughout fiscal 2009 however our chicken segment in the first part of fiscal 2009 will be negatively impacted by difficult export markets and long grain positions that could negatively impact our covenant compliance 

  

  

tyson foods inc 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations the offbalance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties including a lease and grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment see note 9 “commitments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of september 27 2008 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

in addition to the amounts shown above in the table we have unrecognized tax benefits of 220 million and related interest and penalties of 67 million at september 27 2008 recorded as liabilities in accordance with interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 during fiscal 2009 tax audit resolutions could potentially reduce these amounts by approximately 38 million either because tax positions are sustained on audit or because we agree to their disallowance for the remaining liability due to the uncertainties related to these income tax matters we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amounts or timing of potential reductions

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas no 158 sfas no 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income we adopted sfas no 158 at the end of fiscal 2007 except for the requirement to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its annual consolidated balance sheet which we adopted in fiscal 2008 and which had an immaterial impact see note 13 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact of the adoption of sfas no 158 

  

in march 2005 the fasb issued fin 47 statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” sfas no 143 was issued in june 2001 and requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made sfas no 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset that resulted from the acquisition construction development andor the normal operation of a longlived asset the associated asset costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the longlived asset fin 47 clarifies the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in sfas no 143 which refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity fin 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated uncertainty about the timing andor method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists we adopted fin 47 as of september 30 2006 see note 2 “change in accounting principle” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact of the adoption of fin 47

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 sfas no 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities this standard also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas no 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value beginning september 28 2008 we partially applied sfas no 157 as allowed by fasb staff position fsp 1572 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities as of september 28 2008 we have applied the provisions of sfas no 157 to our financial instruments and the impact was not material under fsp 1572 we will be required to apply sfas no 157 to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities at the beginning of fiscal 2010 we are currently reviewing the applicability of sfas no 157 to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities as well as the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas no 159 this statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities firm commitments and nonfinancial warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contractbycontract basis with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period at september 28 2008 we did not elect the fair value option under sfas no 159 and therefore there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” sfas no 160 sfas no 160 amends accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” to establish accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary this statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity and should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements rather than in the liability or mezzanine section between liabilities and equity sfas no 160 also requires consolidated net income be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest the impact of sfas no 160 will not have a material impact on our current consolidated financial statements sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 therefore we expect to adopt sfas no 160 at the beginning of fiscal 2010 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141r “business combinations” sfas no 141r sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination 1 recognizes and measures in its financial statements identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 2 recognizes and measures goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3 determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination sfas no 141r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 therefore we expect to adopt sfas no 141r for any business combinations entered into beginning in fiscal 2010 

  

in march 2008 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 133” sfas no 161 sfas no 161 establishes enhanced disclosure requirements about 1 how and why an entity uses derivative instruments 2 how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement 133 and its related interpretations and 3 how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas no 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 therefore we expect to adopt sfas no 161 in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 

  

in may 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no apb 141 “accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement” fsp apb 141 fsp apb 141 specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods the amount allocated to the equity component represents a discount to the debt which is amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the debt fsp apb 141 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is not permitted therefore we expect to adopt the provisions of fsp apb 141 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the provisions of fsp apb 141 are required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon retrospective adoption we anticipate our effective interest rate on our 325 convertible senior notes due 2013 will range from 80 to 850 which would result in the recognition of an approximate 90 million to 100 million discount to these notes with the offsetting after tax amount recorded to capital in excess of par value this discount will be accreted until the maturity date at the effective interest rate which will not materially impact fiscal 2008 interest expense but will result in an estimated 15 million to 20 million increase to our fiscal 2009 interest expense

critical accounting estimates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

market risk 

  

market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 133 as amended depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value as defined by sfas no 133 is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges these positions are marked to market and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales 

  

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

commodities risk we purchase certain commodities such as grains and livestock in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative 

  

  

tyson foods inc 

financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 133 could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 27 2008 and september 29 2007 on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge derivative financial instruments 

  

 

  

interest rate risk at september 27 2008 we had fixedrate debt of 29 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 70 we have exposure to changes in interest rates on this fixedrate debt market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 45 million at september 27 2008 and 58 million at september 29 2007 the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

  

at september 27 2008 we had variable rate debt of 19 million with a weighted average interest rate of 46 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at september 27 2008 and september 29 2007 would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

  

foreign currency risk we have foreign exchange gainloss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currency exchanges we have exposure to are the canadian dollar the mexican peso the european euro the british pound sterling and the brazilian real we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at september 27 2008 and september 29 2007 related to the foreign exchange forward contracts would have an 11 million and 3 million respectively impact on pretax income in the future we may enter into more foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of our international growth strategy 

  

concentrations of credit risk our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at september 27 2008 and september 29 2007 122 and 121 respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from walmart stores inc no other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

raw materials and sources of supply 

chicken the primary raw materials used in our chicken operations consist of live chickens raised primarily by independent contract growers our verticallyintegrated chicken process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks and ends with broilers for processing breeder flocks ie grandparents are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced fertile eggs are incubated at the grandparent hatchery and produce pullets ie parents pullets are sent to breeder houses and the resulting eggs are sent to our hatcheries once chicks have hatched they are sent to broiler farms there contract growers care for and raise the chicks according to our standards while receiving advice from our technical service personnel until the broilers reach the desired processing weight adult chickens are hauled to processing plants and finished products are sent to distribution centers then transported to customers 

  

we operate our own feed mills to produce scientificallyformulated feeds in fiscal 2007 corn and soybean meal were major production costs representing roughly 41 of our cost of growing a live chicken in addition to feed ingredients to grow the chickens we use cooking ingredients packaging materials and cryogenic agents we believe our sources of supply for these materials are adequate for our present needs and we do not anticipate any difficulty in acquiring these materials in the future while we produce substantially our entire inventory of breeder chickens and live broilers from timetotime we purchase live icepacked or deboned chicken to meet production requirements 

  

beef the primary raw materials used in our beef operations are live cattle we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle in the united states we have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers who help secure a supply of livestock for daily startup operations at our facilities our canadian subsidiary lakeside farm industries ltd lakeside has a cattle feeding facility beef carcass production and boxed beef processing facility in 2007 lakesides feedlot provided approximately 20 of that facilitys fed cattle needs 

  

pork the primary raw materials used in our pork operations are live hogs the majority of our live hog supply is obtained through various procurement arrangements with independent producers we also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are processed these buyers are trained to select high quality animals and we continually measure their performance additionally we raise live swine to sell to outside processors and supply a minimal amount of live swine for our own processing needs 

  

prepared foods the primary raw materials used in our prepared foods operations are commodity based raw materials including chicken beef and pork corn flour and vegetables some of these raw materials are provided by the chicken beef and pork segments while others may be purchased from numerous suppliers and manufacturers 

  

seasonal demand 

demand for chicken and beef products generally increases during the spring and summer months and generally decreases during the winter months pork and prepared foods products generally experience increased demand during the winter months primarily due to the holiday season while demand decreases during the spring and summer months 

  

customers 

walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 129 of our fiscal 2007 consolidated sales sales to walmart stores inc were included in the chicken beef pork and prepared foods segments any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could if not replaced have a material impact on our operations no other single customer or customer group represents more than 10 of fiscal 2007 consolidated sales 

  

competition

identifying target markets for valueadded products 

concentrating production sales and marketing efforts to appeal to and enhance the demand from those markets and 

utilizing our national distribution systems and customer support services

a majority interest in a chicken further processing facility in china

a majority interest in a verticallyintegrated beef operation joint venture in argentina however we do not consolidate the entity due to the lack of controlling interest and 

a technical service agreement with grupo melo in panama to assist grupo melo with the production of further processed chicken products and to allow it to license the tyson brand 

  

we continue to explore growth opportunities in foreign countries including but not limited to argentina brazil china india and mexico and believe each offers potential in terms of expanding or developing processing facilities additional information regarding export sales longlived assets located in foreign countries and income loss from foreign operations is set forth in note 17 “segment reporting” of the notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

  

these risks which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials especially feed grains live cattle live swine and energy could negatively impact our earnings 

our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the cost and supply of raw materials such as feed grains live cattle live swine and ingredients as well as the selling prices for our products many of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control corn and soybean meal are major production costs in the poultry industry representing roughly 41 of the cost of growing a chicken in fiscal 2007 as a result fluctuations in prices for these feed ingredients which include competing demand for corn and soybean meal for use in the manufacture of renewable energy can significantly affect our earnings production of feed ingredients is affected by among other things weather patterns throughout the world the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients as well as agricultural policies of domestic and foreign governments 

  

we do not have facilities of our own to raise cattle in the united states however our beef facility in canada has a feed yard that supplies approximately 20 of its live cattle needs at times in the united states we raise a small number of cattle under contract at feed yards owned by third parties however most of the cattle we process are purchased from independent producers we have cattle buyers located throughout cattle producing areas who visit feed yards and buy live cattle on the open spot market we also enter into various risksharing and procurement arrangements with producers who help secure a supply of livestock for daily startup operations at our facilities the majority of our live swine supply is obtained through various procurement arrangements with independent producers we also employ buyers who purchase hogs on a daily basis generally a few days before the animals are required for processing in addition we raise live swine and sell feeder pigs to independent producers for feeding to processing weight and have contract growers feed a minimal amount of companyowned live swine for our own processing needs any decrease in the supply of cattle or swine on the spot market could increase the price of these raw materials and further increase per head cost of production due to lower capacity utilization which could adversely affect our financial results

market demand and the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from global and domestic food processors 

we face competition from other global national and regional food producers and processors the factors on which we compete include 

  

price 

product safety and quality 

brand identification 

breadth and depth of the product offering 

availability of our products 

customer service and 

credit terms 

  

demand for our products also is affected by competitors’ promotional spending the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs and the availability or price of competing proteins 

  

we attempt to obtain prices for our products that reflect in part the price we must pay for the raw materials that go into our products if we are not able to obtain higher prices for our products when the price we pay for raw materials increases we may be unable to maintain positive margins 

  

outbreaks of livestock diseases can significantly affect our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 

demand for our products can be affected significantly by outbreaks of livestock diseases which can have a significant impact on our financial results efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock however outbreaks of disease and other events which may be beyond our control either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us could significantly affect demand for our products consumer perceptions of certain protein products the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations moreover the outbreak of livestock diseases particularly in our chicken segment could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock furthermore an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken beef or other products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results 

  

h5n1  there has been substantial publicity regarding a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza known as h5n1 h5n1 has been affecting asia since 2002 and has been found in other parts of the world as recently as 2006 it is widely believed h5n1 is spread by migratory birds such as ducks and geese there also have been some cases where h5n1 is believed to have passed from birds to humans as humans came into contact with live birds infected with the disease public concerns about h5n1 led for a period of time to a reduction in demand and price for our poultry products outside of the united states although h5n1 has not been identified in north america there have been outbreaks of other low pathogenic strains of avian influenza in north america including in the united states in 2002 and 2004 and in mexico for the past several years that from time to time have impacted our operations these low pathogenic outbreaks have not generated the same level of concern or received the same level of publicity or been accompanied by the same reduction in demand for poultry products as associated with the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain accordingly even if the h5n1 strain does not spread to north america there can be no assurance it will not significantly adversely affect demand for north american produced poultry internationally andor domestically if it were to spread to north america it could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations andor demand for our products in each case it could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 

  

bse  in december 2003 the united states department of agriculture usda announced a single case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse had been diagnosed in a washington state dairy cow the origin of the animal was subsequently traced to a farm in canada shortly after the announcement several countries including japan and south korea closed their borders to the importation of edible beef products from the united states responding to the loss of export markets live cattle prices in the united states declined by approximately 18 during the following week also in 2003 the canadian government announced the first confirmed case of bse in canada which led the usda to close the united states’ border to the import of live canadian cattle this reduced the supply of live cattle available for processing at our domestic facilities and contributed to lower facility capacity utilization the confirmed case in canada also led several countries to close their borders to the import of edible beef products from canada which affected the international sales of our lakeside alberta facility in june 2005 the usda announced a second confirmed case of bse in the united states and in march 2006 announced the third confirmed case furthering uncertainty as to whether or when certain closed markets may reopen and whether or when existing open markets may close a number of these countries subsequently reopened their borders to domestic and canadian beef however some of the countries including japan and south korea have restrictive conditions that limit the types of product that can be imported 

  

tyson foods inc 

we are subject to risks associated with our international operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in such countries 

in fiscal 2007 we exported our products to more than 80 countries including canada central america china the european union japan mexico russia south korea and taiwan our export sales for fiscal 2007 totaled 27 billion in addition we had approximately 211 million of longlived assets located in foreign countries primarily canada and mexico at the end of fiscal 2007 approximately 5 of income before income taxes for fiscal 2007 was from foreign operations 

  

as a result we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

occurrence of any of these events in the markets where we operate or in other developing markets could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in those markets and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

  

we depend on the availability of and good relations with our employees 

we have approximately 104000 employees of whom approximately 32000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the unions we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock 

we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens processed in our poultry operations a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market if we do not attract and maintain contracts with our growers or maintain marketing relationships with independent producers our production operations could be negatively affected 

  

if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 

our products may be subject to contamination by diseaseproducing organisms or pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes salmonella and generic e coli these pathogens are found generally in the environment therefore there is a risk they as a result of food processing could be present in our products these pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further processing foodservice or consumer level these risks may be controlled but may not be eliminated by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing we have little if any control over proper handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims product recalls which may not entirely mitigate the risk of product liability claims increased scrutiny and penalties including injunctive relief and plant closings by federal and state regulatory agencies and adverse publicity which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

tyson foods inc 

our operations are subject to general risks of litigation 

we are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers shareholders employees or injured persons and claims relating to commercial labor employment antitrust securities or environmental matters litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could significantly adversely affect our financial results 

  

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position 

at september 29 2007 we had approximately 28 billion of indebtedness outstanding we had a borrowing capacity of 13 billion consisting of 748 million available under our 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and 537 million under our accounts receivable securitization program at september 29 2007 we expect our indebtedness including borrowings under our credit agreements may increase from time to time in the future for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results capital expenditures and possible acquisitions joint ventures or other significant initiatives our consolidated indebtedness level could significantly affect our business because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

in addition our debt agreements require us to meet specified financial ratios and limit our ability to enter into various transactions our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance we will meet those ratios if we default on any of our indebtedness or if we are unable to obtain necessary liquidity our indebtedness would be due and payable immediately and our business could be significantly adversely affected 

  

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the recoverability of goodwill we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our budgets business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flow and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors to the assessment of recoverability goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business and market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges in addition impairment charges would negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future as of september 29 2007 we had 25 billion of goodwill which represented approximately 243 of total assets 

  

domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing packaging storage distribution advertising and labeling of our products our facilities for processing chicken beef pork prepared foods and milling feed and for housing live chickens and swine are subject to a variety of international federal state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and to the health and safety of our employees our chicken beef and pork processing facilities are participants in the united states government’s hazardous analysis critical control point haccp program and are subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 in addition our chicken beef pork and prepared foods products are subject to inspection prior to distribution primarily by the usda and the united states food and drug administration loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand introducing new 

  

tyson foods inc 

products building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified laws regulations and accounting standards if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or asset seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 

  

a material acquisition joint venture or other significant initiative could affect our operations and financial condition 

we continually evaluate potential acquisitions joint ventures and other initiatives collectively “transactions” and we may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies processing plants technologies products and services from others which could include material transactions a material transaction may involve a number of risks including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

we may not be able to address these problems and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units of our company if we are unable to do this expansion could adversely affect our financial results 

  

market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions 

our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes these positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date therefore losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices 

  

deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could significantly adversely affect the demand for our beef poultry and pork products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby negatively affecting our financial results 

  

changes in consumer preference could negatively impact our business 

the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business 

our business could suffer significant set backs in revenues and operating income if our customers’ plans andor markets should change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers including for example walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 129 of our revenues in fiscal 2007 many of our agreements with our customers are generally shortterm primarily due to the nature of our products industry practice and the fluctuation in demand and price for our products 

  

tyson foods inc 

the consolidation of customers could negatively impact our business 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products if we fail to respond to these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products any of which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 

natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemic or extreme weather including droughts floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors as well as disruptions in our information systems could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

our renewable energy ventures and other initiatives might not be as successful as we expect 

we have been exploring ways to commercialize animal fats and other byproducts from our operations as well as the poultry litter of our contract growers to generate energy and other valueadded products as a result in fiscal 2007 we announced a strategic alliance with conocophillips and the formation of a joint venture with syntroleum corporation we will continue to explore other ways to commercialize opportunities outside our core business such as renewable energy and other technologicallyadvanced platforms these initiatives might not be as financially successful as we initially announce or would expect due to factors that include but are not limited to possible discontinuance of tax credits competing energy prices failure to operate at the volumes anticipated abilities of our joint venture partners and our limited experience in some of these new areas 

  

members of the tyson family can exercise significant control 

members of the tyson family beneficially own in the aggregate 9997 of our outstanding shares of class b common stock 010 par value class b stock and 127 of our outstanding shares of class a common stock 010 par value class a stock giving them control of approximately 71 of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock in addition three members of the tyson family serve on our board of directors as a result members of the tyson family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws the election and removal of directors any proposed merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price additionally as a result of the tyson family’s significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock we have relied on the “controlled company” exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange therefore we have elected not to implement the rule that provides for a nominating committee to identify and recommend nominees to our board of directors pursuant to these exemptions our compensation committee which is made up of independent directors does not have sole authority to determine the compensation of our executive officers including our chief executive officer

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash needs for operations growth and capital expenditures are expected to be met with cash flows provided by operating activities as well as shortterm borrowings 

  

reclassification in fiscal 2007 we reclassified 85 million and 27 million respectively for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 in negative book cash balances from changes in working capital reported as operating activities to increase decrease in negative book cash balances reported as financing activities to conform with the current period presentation 

  

 

  

income before changes in working capital represents net income loss adjusted for noncash income and expenses additionally this amount represents net cash provided by operating activities prior to changes in assets and liabilities associated with operations 

  

over the past three years cash provided by operating activities was approximately 21 billion which enabled us to fund 14 billion in capital expenditures and pay down debt by 593 million 

  

changes in working capital

credit ratings 

on july 24 2006 moody’s investors services inc moody’s downgraded the credit rating applicable to the 2016 notes from “baa3” to “ba1” this downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 660 to 685 effective on the first day of the interest period during which the rating change required an adjustment to the interest rate ie the issuance of the 2016 notes this downgrade did not have a material impact to interest expense additionally on july 31 2006 standard  poor’s sp downgraded the credit rating applicable to the 2016 notes from “bbb” to “bbb” this downgrade did not result in an increase in the interest rate on the 2016 notes nor did it result in an increase in interest expense or related fees for other debt 

  

on september 18 2006 tyson fresh meats tfm a whollyowned subsidiary of the company guaranteed the 2016 notes this guarantee does not extend to the other unsecured senior notes of the company moody’s and sp did not change the july 2006 credit ratings applicable to the 2016 notes however moody’s issued a new credit rating of “ba2” and sp issued a new credit rating of “bb” related to the other unsecured senior notes not guaranteed by tfm these new ratings did not impact the interest rate applicable to the 2016 notes and did not have a material impact on interest expense 

  

sp currently rates the 2016 notes “bbb” with a negative outlook moody’s currently rates this debt “ba1” with a negative outlook the pretax impact to earnings of a further downgrade would not be material

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

market risk 

  

market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks we enter into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge as defined by sfas no 133 as amended depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 133 as amended is recognized immediately additionally we hold certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges these positions are marked to market and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date the changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales the changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding forward sales contracts are recorded in sales 

  

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

tyson foods inc 

commodities risk we purchase certain commodities such as grains livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations as part of our commodity risk management activities we use derivative financial instruments primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 133 could result in volatility in our results of operations contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 29 2007 and september 30 2006 on the fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge positions the following sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions 

  

 

  

interest rate risk at september 29 2007 we had fixedrate debt of 25 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 75 we have exposure to changes in interest rates on this fixedrate debt market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 58 million at september 29 2007 and 87 million at september 30 2006 the fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

  

at september 29 2007 we had variable rate debt of 275 million with a weighted average interest rate of 59 a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates effective at september 29 2007 and september 30 2006 would have a minimal effect on interest expense 

  

foreign currency risk we have noncash foreign exchange gainloss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of certain receivable and payable balances the primary currency exchanges we have exposure to are the canadian dollar the mexican peso the european euro the british pound sterling and the brazilian real we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure a hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates effective at september 29 2007 and september 30 2006 would have a minimal effect on pretax income 

  

concentrations of credit risk our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral at september 29 2007 and september 30 2006 approximately 121 and 130 respectively of our net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer no other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

operations for fiscal 2005 benefited from higher average sales prices in the company’s chicken pork and prepared food segments product mix improvements and decreased grain costs in the company’s chicken segment these benefits were partially offset by losses from the company’s commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases as compared to prior year gains from commodity risk management activities on grain positions operating income was also negatively impacted by higher energy costs higher live hog prices in the pork segment and higher raw material costs in the prepared foods segment additionally earnings for fiscal 2005 were negatively impacted by the company’s beef segment operating loss primarily due to lower domestic cattle supplies and restrictions on imports of canadian cattle for most of the year which resulted in lower production volumes and raised the operating cost per head also the beef segment’s operating results were negatively impacted by limited access to export markets 

  

in fiscal 2005 the company continued to generate strong cash flow this allowed the company to pay down debt by 367 million and exceed the company’s debttocapital ratio goal of 40 by reaching 39 at year end the company began construction of a third fully dedicated caseready plant in fiscal 2005 this plant is scheduled to begin operating in fiscal 2006 and once fully operational it is expected to increase caseready capacity by onethird additionally in fiscal 2005 the company continued construction of facilities at its corporate center as well as a variety of other projects that will increase automation and support valueadded product growth

outlook 

as the company begins fiscal 2006 its intent is to continue to focus on the three primary elements of the company’s strategy the first element of the strategy is to continue to increase the sales mix of valueadded products the company’s goal for fiscal 2006 is to increase its mix of valueadded product sales to 12 billion an increase of approximately 900 million as compared to fiscal 2005

the second element of the strategy is to continue to improve operating efficiencies for fiscal 2006 the company anticipates spending approximately 232 million on cost savings and income producing projects which are expected to result in annual after tax savings of approximately 72 million the third element of the strategy is to expand the company’s presence in international markets the company’s goal for fiscal 2006 is to increase its incountry presence in at least one foreign market

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r which is a revision of fasb statement no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas no 123 sfas no 123r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends fasb statement no 95 “statement of cash flows” the revision requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options in the financial statements based on

the fair value at the date of the grant sfas no 123r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method under the modified prospective method compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 123r that remain unvested on the effective date the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption for the impact of adopting this standard the company will apply the modified prospective method upon adoption in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission announced it would provide for phasedin implementation of sfas no 123r as a result sfas no 123r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period of the registrant’s first fiscal year beginning on or after june 15 2005 the company estimates that compensation expense related to employee stock options for fiscal 2006 is expected to be in the range of 1015 million sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption the company believes this reclass will not have a material impact on its consolidated statements of cash flows

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the company 

  

financial instruments the company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as corn soybeans livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to various market risks generally contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are designated and highly effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 133 as amended if a derivative instrument is a hedge as defined by sfas no 133 depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales instruments the company holds as part of its risk management activities that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting as defined by sfas no 133 as amended are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings the company generally does not hedge anticipated transactions beyond 12 months 

  

contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to wage and hourlabor livestock procurement securities environmental product taxing authorities and other matters and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required if any for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the company’s assumptions the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the company’s control 

  

accrued self insurance insurance expense for health and welfare workers’ compensation auto liability and general liability risks are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management however actual expenses could differ from these estimates which could result in adjustments to amounts recorded

goodwill and other intangible asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company’s goodwill and other intangible assets management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded the company assesses its goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets”

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

commodities risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as corn soybeans livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations the company uses commodity futures to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying the company’s derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 133 could result in volatility in the company’s results of operations generally contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of october 1 2005 and october 2 2004 respectively on fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge positions the underlying commodities hedged have a correlation to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are inversely correlated the following sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions

interest rate risk the company has exposure to changes in interest rates on its fixedrate longterm debt market risk for fixedrate longterm debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately 47 million at october 1 2005 and 51 million at october 2 2004 the fair values of the company’s longterm debt were estimated based upon quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

  

the company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of its financial instruments under the terms of various leveraged equipment loans the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings the maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from fiscal years 2006 to 2009 with interest rates ranging from 47 to 60 because of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements an increase in interest rates would have a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years 2005 and 2004

concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables the companys cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral at october 1 2005 and october 2 2004 approximately 130 and 150 respectively of the company’s net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer no other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

note 17 income taxes 

  

detail of the provision for income taxes consists of 

  

   

the reasons for the difference between the effective income tax rate and the statutory us federal income tax rate are as follows 

  

   

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company repatriated 404 million of foreign earnings invested outside the united states under the provisions of the american jobs creations act the total tax expense relating to the repatriation was 22 million offset by 15 million relating to the reversal of certain international tax reserves no longer required due to the effects of the repatriation under the american jobs creation act the fiscal 2005 effective rate was reduced by 36 due to the federal income tax effect of the medicare part d subsidy since this income is not subject to federal income tax items included in other are miscellaneous nondeductible expenses general business credits and amounts relating to ongoing examinations by taxing authorities 

  

  

tyson foods inc 

  

the fiscal 2005 effective rate was also reduced by 41 due to the reduction of income tax reserves management deemed were no longer required the company recorded a reduction to current income tax expense of 22 million relating to a change of estimate of reserves for years in which examinations by the internal revenue service have been completed additional adjustments resulted in a reduction of goodwill of 27 million and an increase in capital in excess of par value of 25 million 

  

deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 

  

the tax effects of major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities are 

  

   

net deferred tax liabilities are included in other current liabilities and deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets 

  

the deferred tax liability for suspended taxes from conversion to accrual method represents the 1987 change from the cash to accrual method of accounting and will be paid down by 2017 subject to certain limitations 

  

the company has accumulated but undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately 161 million at october 1 2005 which are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in the business if those earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise the company would be subject to us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits state income taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries it is not currently practicable to estimate the tax liability that might be payable on the repatriation of these foreign earnings 

  

the valuation allowance totaling 102 million consists of 16 million for state tax credit carryforwards which have been fully reserved 78 million for us federal net operating loss and other miscellaneous carryforwards and 8 million for international net operating loss carryforwards the state tax credit carryforwards expire in the fiscal years 2006 through 2009 at october 1 2005 after considering utilization restrictions the companys federal tax loss carryforwards which include net operating losses capital losses and charitable contribution carryforwards approximated 241 million the net operating loss carryforwards total 217 million are subject to utilization limitations due to ownership changes and may be utilized to offset future taxable income subject to 

  

tyson foods inc 

  

limitations these carryforwards expire during fiscal years 2006 through 2023 the 78 million valuation allowance discussed above includes 27 million that if subsequently recognized will be allocated to reduce goodwill which was recorded at the time of acquisition of tfm 

  

in accordance with sfas 109 “accounting for income taxes” and sfas 5 “accounting for contingencies” the company provides tax reserves for federal state local and international exposures relating to audit results tax planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities the development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate although the outcome of these tax items is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities relating to these exposures 

  

note 18 earnings per share 

  

the weighted average common shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the board of directors and shareholders 

tyson foods inc 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting as restated that tyson foods inc did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 1 2005 because of the effect of the company’s material weakness relating to the accounting for income taxes for unusual transactions based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria tyson foods inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our report dated december 7 2005 we expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s previous assessment that tyson foods inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 1 2005 and an unqualified opinion that the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 1 2005 based on the coso criteria management has subsequently determined that a deficiency in controls relating to the accounting for income taxes for unusual transactions existed as of the previous assessment date and has further concluded that such deficiency represented a material weakness as of october 1 2005 as a result management has revised its assessment as presented in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting to conclude that tyson foods inc’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of october 1 2005 accordingly our present opinion on the effectiveness of tyson foods inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of october 1 2005 as expressed herein is different from that expressed in our previous report 

  

  

tyson foods inc 

  

a material weakness is a control deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected the following material weakness has been identified as a material weakness in management’s assessment in its assessment as of october 1 2005 management identified a material weakness in tyson foods inc’s accounting for income taxes for unusual transactions and as a result concluded tyson foods inc’s previously reported income tax expense had been overstated the insufficient controls resulted in the restatement of tyson foods inc’s consolidated financial statements as of october 1 2005 and for the year then ended this material weakness was considered in determining the nature timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2005 financial statements and this report does not affect our report dated december 7 2005 except for the “restatement” section of note 1 as to which the date is february 6 2006 on those consolidated financial statements as restated 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that tyson foods inc did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 1 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria tyson foods inc has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 1 2005 based on the coso criteria

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of company management including the chief executive officer ceo and the interim chief financial officer cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the 1934 act based on that evaluation management including the ceo and cfo has concluded that as of october 1 2005 the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that the company files or submits under the 1934 act has been recorded processed summarized and reported in accordance with the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission due to the identification of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the company’s accounting for income taxes for unusual transactions as described below 

  

the company’s annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended october 1 2005 was filed with the securities and exchange commission on december 12 2005 subsequent to the filing of the form 10k management identified an error in the company’s income tax provision for the fourth quarter ended october 1 2005 whereby the actuarial gain recorded in that quarter of 55 million related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 was not considered a permanent difference in the company’s income tax provision as a result the company restated their 2005 financial statements to reverse 19 million of income tax expense inappropriately recorded 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

other than the matters described in this item 9a in the fourth quarter ending october 1 2005 there have been no significant changes in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal controls over financial reporting 

  

the company has previously reported ongoing remediation efforts related to the company’s subsidiary in mexico tdm during a detailed review of tdm in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the company identified internal control deficiencies and recorded a number of adjustments to tdm’s financial statements as a result management believes oversight and monitoring processes related to the financial statements of tdm did not function effectively throughout fiscal 2004 the company initiated activities to remediate the internal control issues identified at tdm including but not limited to adding certain accounting personnel that have more experience in financial accounting and reporting than such personnel previously performing these functions aligning the accounting function at tdm with the accounting function at the company’s corporate headquarters developing and implementing comprehensive accounting and financial reporting processes educating employees throughout tdm as to the importance of compliance with policies and procedures and the significance of a system of sound internal controls upgrading financial systems and implementing additional monitoring controls at the company’s corporate headquarters with respect to tdm’s financial reporting and accounting processes as of october 1 2005 management believes that the processes that have been implemented are adequate to remedy the control deficiencies identified 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company implemented additional controls in the existing processes to accumulate analyze record and relieve income taxes payable specifically related to processes to effectively reconcile the income taxes payable general ledger accounts to supporting detail and adequately verify data used in computations management believes the controls are currently effective 

  

management and the audit committee do not believe that these tdm deficiencies individually or in the aggregate had a material effect on the financial statements of the company

operations for fiscal 2005 benefited from higher average sales prices in the company’s chicken pork and prepared food segments product mix improvements and decreased grain costs in the company’s chicken segment these benefits were partially offset by losses from the company’s commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases as compared to prior year gains from commodity risk management activities on grain positions operating income was also negatively impacted by higher energy costs higher live hog prices in the pork segment and higher raw material costs in the prepared foods segment additionally earnings for fiscal 2005 were negatively impacted by the company’s beef segment operating loss primarily due to lower domestic cattle supplies and restrictions on imports of canadian cattle for most of the year which resulted in lower production volumes and raised the operating cost per head also the beef segment’s operating results were negatively impacted by limited access to export markets 

  

in fiscal 2005 the company continued to generate strong cash flow this allowed the company to pay down debt by 367 million and exceed the company’s debttocapital ratio goal of 40 by reaching 39 at year end the company began construction of a third fully dedicated caseready plant in fiscal 2005 this plant is scheduled to begin operating in fiscal 2006 and once fully operational it is expected to increase caseready capacity by onethird additionally in fiscal 2005 the company continued construction of facilities at its corporate center as well as a variety of other projects that will increase automation and support valueadded product growth 

  

the companys accounting cycle resulted in a 52week year for fiscal years 2005 and 2003 and a 53week year for fiscal 2004 

  

outlook 

as the company begins fiscal 2006 its intent is to continue to focus on the three primary elements of the company’s strategy the first element of the strategy is to continue to increase the sales mix of valueadded products the company’s goal for fiscal 2006 is to increase its mix of valueadded product sales to 12 billion an increase of approximately 900 million as compared to fiscal 2005 

  

tyson foods inc 

  

the second element of the strategy is to continue to improve operating efficiencies for fiscal 2006 the company anticipates spending approximately 232 million on cost savings and income producing projects which are expected to result in annual after tax savings of approximately 72 million the third element of the strategy is to expand the company’s presence in international markets the company’s goal for fiscal 2006 is to increase its incountry presence in at least one foreign market 

  

in fiscal 2006 the company expects the chicken segment results to remain solid currently grain prices are expected to be favorable in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 and the company anticipates good demand for chicken going into the start of fiscal 2006 the company anticipates operating income will be negatively impacted in fiscal 2006 by higher energy costs although there have been recent developments in the beef export market that are encouraging the company believes the beef segment will continue to face difficult operating conditions in fiscal 2006 especially in the first two quarters of the year the company anticipates the supply of live hogs to increase slightly in fiscal 2006 which should generate more normal returns in the pork segment additionally the company anticipates improved market share in the prepared foods segment in fiscal 2006

the fair value at the date of the grant sfas no 123r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method under the modified prospective method compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 123r that remain unvested on the effective date the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption for the impact of adopting this standard the company will apply the modified prospective method upon adoption in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission announced it would provide for phasedin implementation of sfas no 123r as a result sfas no 123r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period of the registrant’s first fiscal year beginning on or after june 15 2005 the company estimates that compensation expense related to employee stock options for fiscal 2006 is expected to be in the range of 1015 million sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption the company believes this reclass will not have a material impact on its consolidated statements of cash flows

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the company 

  

financial instruments the company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as corn soybeans livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to various market risks generally contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are designated and highly effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 133 as amended if a derivative instrument is a hedge as defined by sfas no 133 depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instrument’s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales instruments the company holds as part of its risk management activities that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting as defined by sfas no 133 as amended are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings the company generally does not hedge anticipated transactions beyond 12 months 

  

contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to wage and hourlabor livestock procurement securities environmental product taxing authorities and other matters and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required if any for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the company’s assumptions the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the company’s control 

  

accrued self insurance insurance expense for health and welfare workers’ compensation auto liability and general liability risks are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management however actual expenses could differ from these estimates which could result in adjustments to amounts recorded

goodwill and other intangible asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company’s goodwill and other intangible assets management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded the company assesses its goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets”

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the company’s exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

commodities risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as corn soybeans livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations the company uses commodity futures to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity however as the commodities underlying the company’s derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations any requirement to marktomarket the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 133 could result in volatility in the company’s results of operations generally contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of october 1 2005 and october 2 2004 respectively on fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge positions the underlying commodities hedged have a correlation to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are inversely correlated the following sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions

interest rate risk the company has exposure to changes in interest rates on its fixedrate longterm debt market risk for fixedrate longterm debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately 47 million at october 1 2005 and 51 million at october 2 2004 the fair values of the company’s longterm debt were estimated based upon quoted market prices andor published interest rates 

  

the company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of its financial instruments under the terms of various leveraged equipment loans the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings the maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from fiscal years 2006 to 2009 with interest rates ranging from 47 to 60 because of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements an increase in interest rates would have a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years 2005 and 2004

concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables the companys cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral at october 1 2005 and october 2 2004 approximately 130 and 150 respectively of the company’s net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer no other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

tyson foods inc 

  

the fiscal 2005 effective rate was reduced by 41 due to the reduction of income tax reserves management deemed were no longer required the company recorded a reduction to current income tax expense of 22 million relating to a change of estimate of reserves for years in which examinations by the internal revenue service have been completed additional adjustments resulted in a reduction of goodwill of 27 million and an increase in capital in excess of par value of 25 million

the tax effects of major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities are 

  

   

net deferred tax liabilities are included in other current liabilities and deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets

the valuation allowance totaling 102 million consists of 16 million for state tax credit carryforwards which have been fully reserved 78 million for us federal net operating loss and other miscellaneous carryforwards and 8 million for international net operating loss carryforwards the state tax credit carryforwards expire in the fiscal years 2006 through 2009 at october 1 2005 after considering utilization restrictions the companys federal tax loss carryforwards which include net operating losses capital losses and charitable contribution carryforwards approximated 241 million the net operating loss carryforwards total 217 million are subject to utilization limitations due to ownership changes and may be utilized to offset future taxable income subject to

limitations these carryforwards expire during fiscal years 2006 through 2023 the 78 million valuation allowance discussed above includes 27 million that if subsequently recognized will be allocated to reduce goodwill which was recorded at the time of acquisition of tfm 

  

in accordance with sfas 109 “accounting for income taxes” and sfas 5 “accounting for contingencies” the company provides tax reserves for federal state local and international exposures relating to audit results tax planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities the development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate although the outcome of these tax items is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities relating to these exposures

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the company 

financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to various market risks including certain livestock interest rates and grain and feed costs the company may hold positions as economic hedges for which hedge accounting is not applied see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to wage and hourlabor cattle procurement securities environmental product and other matters and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of reserves required if any for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the companys assumptions the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the companys control see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

accrued self insurance insurance expense for casualty claims and employeerelated health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management however actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets the company is required to assess potential impairments to its longlived assets which is primarily property plant and equipment if impairment indicators are present the company must measure the fair value of the assets in accordance with sfas 121 to determine if adjustments are to be recorded see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of the companys goodwill and other intangible assets management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded on september 30 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets and was required to assess its goodwill for impairment issues upon adoption and then at least annually thereafter see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

market risk market risks relating to the companys operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks the company enters into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings additionally the company held certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures and options for which it does not apply hedge accounting but instead marks these positions to fair value through earnings at each reporting date 

in fiscal 2002 the company changed its market risk disclosure type from a tabular presentation to a sensitivity analysis presentation due to the acquisition of ibp the companys commodity market risk became more diverse as a result of a more complex risk profile the company believes a sensitivity analysis provides a clearer understanding of the risks associated with the companys positions the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities and hypothetical changes in exchange rates related to interest rates sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the companys exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities primarily corn soybeans and livestock the company periodically uses commodity futures and options for hedging purposes to reduce the effect of changing commodity prices and as a mechanism to procure grains and livestock generally contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 28 2002 and september 29 2001 respectively on fair value of open positions the fair value of such position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge positions the underlying commodities hedged have a high correlation to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are inversely correlated the following sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for livestock and a direct impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for grain 

 interest rate risk the company has exposure to changes in interest rates on the companys fixedrate longterm debt market risk for fixedrate longterm debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately 75 million at september 28 2002 the fair values of the companys longterm debt were estimated using discounted future cash flows based on the companys incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 

the company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of its financial instruments under the terms of various leveraged equipment loans the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings the maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from 2005 to 2008 with interest rates ranging from 47 to 60 because of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements an increase in interest rates would have a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years 2002 and 2001 

 

foreign currency risk the company also periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency exposure the company enters into forward contracts to hedge exposure to united states currency fluctuations inherent in its receivables and purchase commitments the fair value of these contracts was not significant at september 28 2002 and september 29 2001 foreign forward contracts generally have maturities or expirations not exceeding 12 months a 10 change in the exchange rate of the currencies hedged would change the fair value of the contracts by 4 million at both september 28 2002 and september 29 2001 

concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables the companys cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral at september 28 2002 approximately 108 of the companys total accounts receivable balance was due from one customer no other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10 of total accounts receivable

 item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

results of operations 

earnings for fiscal 2003 were 337 million or 096 per diluted share compared to 383 million or 108 per diluted share in fiscal 2002 fiscal 2003 pretax earnings include 167 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation and 76 million of costs related to the closing of poultry operations during the first third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003 

 

the companys accounting cycle resulted in a 52week year for fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 

 

2003 vs 2002 

 

certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current presentations 

 

sales increased 12 billion or 51 with a slight increase in volume and a 50 increase in price 

 

cost of sales increased 13 billion or 58 as a percent of sales cost of sales was 929 for 2003 compared to 922 for 2002 this increase is primarily due to higher live cattle prices in the beef segment increases in grain costs in the chicken segment and increased accruals related to ongoing litigation partially offset by 167 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation 

 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 46 million or 54 as a percent of sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased from 38 to 34 the decrease is primarily due to the expense reductions of approximately 42 million related to the sale of specialty brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and approximately 16 million associated with the ongoing integration of tyson and ibp inc ibp corporate functions additional decreases were due to favorable investment returns of approximately 18 million on company owned life insurance actuarial gains of 13 million related to changes in certain retiree medical benefit plans and decreased litigation costs of approximately 19 million resulting primarily from the reversal of certain legal accruals which are no longer required due to cases being closed the decreases in selling general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increased professional fees of approximately 26 million primarily related to the companys ongoing integration and strategic initiatives and increased sales promotions and marketing costs of approximately 45 million primarily due to the introduction and rollout of several new products 

 

other charges include 76 million of plant closing costs incurred in fiscal 2003 and 53 million of charges incurred in fiscal 2002 related to the discontinuation of the thomas e wilson brand and the restructuring of the companys live swine operations 

 

interest expense decreased 9 million or 28 compared to 2002 primarily resulting from an 82 decrease in the companys average indebtedness as a percent of sales interest expense was 12 compared to 13 for 2002 the overall weighted average borrowing rate increased to 74 from 70 primarily resulting from premiums paid on bonds repurchased in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003 excluding the premiums paid interest expense decreased 21 million 

 

other expense increased 29 million from the same period last year primarily resulting from the 10 million writedown related to the impairment of an equity interest in a live swine operation recorded in fiscal 2003 and the prior year gain of 22 million from the sale of the specialty brands inc subsidiary 

 

the effective tax rate was 355 in both 2003 and 2002 several factors impact the effective tax rate including average state income tax rates the tax rates for international operations and the extraterritorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales taxes on international earnings were comparable for 2003 and 2002 average state taxes added 22 and 3 to the effective tax rate for 2003 compared to 2002 and eti reduced the effective rate by 19 in 2003 compared to a 14 reduction in 2002 various legislative bills have been introduced in 2003 which would repeal the eti exclusion over a period of time and replace eti with a partial tax exclusion for certain domestic production activities if the eti exclusion is repealed and replacement legislation is not enacted 

 

 

the loss of the eti tax benefit may adversely impact the companys effective tax rate

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the company 

 

financial instruments   the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to various market risks including certain livestock natural gas interest rates and grain and feed costs the company may hold positions as economic hedges for which hedge accounting is not applied see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

  

contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to wage and hourlabor cattle procurement securities environmental product and other matters and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of reserves required if any for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the companys assumptions the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the companys control see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

accrued self insurance   insurance expense for casualty claims and employeerelated health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management however actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized 

 

impairment of longlived assets   the company is required to assess potential impairments to its longlived assets which are primarily property plant and equipment if impairment indicators are present the company must measure the fair value of the assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment of disposal of longlived assets to determine if adjustments are to be recorded 

 

goodwill and intangible asset impairment   in assessing the recoverability of the companys goodwill and other intangible assets management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded on september 30 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets and was required to assess its goodwill for impairment issues upon adoption and then at least annually thereafter see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

  


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

  

market risk 

market risks relating to the companys operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks the company enters into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is a hedge as defined by sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 133 as amended depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value as defined by sfas no 133 as amended will be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings additionally the company holds certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures and options for which it does not apply hedge accounting but instead marks these positions to fair value through earnings at each reporting date 

 

the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities and hypothetical changes in exchange rates related to interest rates sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the companys exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

commodities risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as corn soybeans livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations the company uses commodity futures and options for hedging purposes to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity generally contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 27 2003 and september 28 2002 respectively on fair value of open positions the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge positions the underlying commodities hedged have a correlation to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are inversely correlated the following sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for livestock and natural gas and a direct impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for grain 

 

   

interest rate risk the company has exposure to changes in interest rates on its fixedrate longterm debt market risk for fixedrate longterm debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately 62 million at september 27 2003 the fair values of the companys longterm debt were estimated based upon quoted market prices and or published interest rates 

  

the company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of its financial instruments under the terms of various leveraged equipment loans the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings the maturity dates of these leveraged 

equipment loans range from 2005 to 2008 with interest rates ranging from 47 to 60 because of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements an increase in interest rates would have a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 

 

foreign currency risk the company also periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency exposure the company enters into forward contracts to hedge exposure to us currency fluctuations inherent in its receivables and purchase commitments there were no such contracts outstanding at september 27 2003 and the fair value of forward contracts at september 28 2002 was not significant foreign forward contracts generally have maturities or expirations not exceeding 12 months a 10 change in the exchange rate of the currencies hedged at september 28 2002 would have changed the fair value of the contracts by 4 million 

 

concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables the companys cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral at september 27 2003 approximately 103 of the companys net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer no other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10 of net accounts receivable

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the company 

financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to various market risks including certain livestock interest rates and grain and feed costs the company may hold positions as economic hedges for which hedge accounting is not applied see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to wage and hourlabor cattle procurement securities environmental product and other matters and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of reserves required if any for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the companys assumptions the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the companys control see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

accrued self insurance insurance expense for casualty claims and employeerelated health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management however actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets the company is required to assess potential impairments to its longlived assets which is primarily property plant and equipment if impairment indicators are present the company must measure the fair value of the assets in accordance with sfas 121 to determine if adjustments are to be recorded see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of the companys goodwill and other intangible assets management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded on september 30 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets and was required to assess its goodwill for impairment issues upon adoption and then at least annually thereafter see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

market risk market risks relating to the companys operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations to address certain of these risks the company enters into various derivative transactions as described below if a derivative instrument is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings additionally the company held certain positions primarily in grain and livestock futures and options for which it does not apply hedge accounting but instead marks these positions to fair value through earnings at each reporting date 

in fiscal 2002 the company changed its market risk disclosure type from a tabular presentation to a sensitivity analysis presentation due to the acquisition of ibp the companys commodity market risk became more diverse as a result of a more complex risk profile the company believes a sensitivity analysis provides a clearer understanding of the risks associated with the companys positions the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities and hypothetical changes in exchange rates related to interest rates sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the companys exposure to changes nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodities risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities primarily corn soybeans and livestock the company periodically uses commodity futures and options for hedging purposes to reduce the effect of changing commodity prices and as a mechanism to procure grains and livestock generally contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 in market prices as of september 28 2002 and september 29 2001 respectively on fair value of open positions the fair value of such position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and nonhedge positions the underlying commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative positions 

 interest rate risk the company has exposure to changes in interest rates on the companys fixedrate longterm debt market risk for fixedrate longterm debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately 75 million at september 28 2002 the fair values of the companys longterm debt were estimated using discounted future cash flows based on the companys incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 

the company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of its financial instruments under the terms of various leveraged equipment loans the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings the maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from 2005 to 2008 with interest rates ranging from 47 to 60 because of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements an increase in interest rates would have a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years 2002 and 2001 

 

foreign currency risk the company also periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency exposure the company enters into forward contracts to hedge exposure to united states currency fluctuations inherent in its receivables and purchase commitments the fair value of these contracts was not significant at september 28 2002 and september 29 2001 foreign forward contracts generally have maturities or expirations not exceeding 12 months a 10 change in the exchange rate of the currencies hedged would change the fair value of the contracts by 4 million at both september 28 2002 and september 29 2001 

concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables the companys cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral at september 28 2002 approximately 108 of the companys total accounts receivable balance was due from one customer no other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10 of total accounts receivable
